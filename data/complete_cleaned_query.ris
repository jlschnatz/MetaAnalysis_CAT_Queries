AB  - This study focused on test-takers<e2><80><99> psychological effects on computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The development and implementation of CAT were based on item response theory (IRT), and two-parameter logistic model was chosen for the items. The total of 268 students from a high school in Jinan took part in the English adaptive test. A structural equation model was used to examine the potential connections among a series of individual variables (computer self-efficacy, training satisfaction, test anxiety, CAT attitude and CAT performance). The findings revealed significant positive paths from computer self-efficacy and training satisfaction to CAT attitude, as well as a negative path from test anxiety to CAT performance. Furthermore, there was significant correlation between the residual variances of CAT attitude and CAT performance. Thus, it could be seen CAT might produce an unfair disadvantage for test-takers with higher test anxiety. The relevant research and implications were further discussed.

AB  - This work aims to reduce the test time per chip, but affect the quality of the products only as little as possible compared to the conventional semiconductor test. For that purpose, a simulation software has been developed that performs adaptive test simulations based on real data and test results of conventional production testing. Products has been analyzed and both the potential for test time savings and the resulting loss of quality are determined. Finally, it is shown that by the intelligent omission of tests, compared to conventional testing procedures, test time reduction of up to 50 % can be achieved. In contrast, there are only few defective components that are not detected by the adaptive test procedure and which reduced the quality of products. In best case, the fraction of test escapes was under 40 ppm. To handle the potential risk of test escapes this paper also introduces a statistical estimation method.

AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance. Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables.This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance.The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection). Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited.No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.

AB  - The wide variation in process parameters now being observed in advanced semiconductor processes can sometimes cause the electrical impact of subtle manufacturing defects on observed signals during post manufacturing tests to remain within the acceptable range set to ensure viable manufacturing yields, thereby masking defect detection. Such undetected manufacturing flaws can potentially cause functional failure under inputs and/or operating conditions not tested during test; they can also behave as latent reliability defects that "grow" over time to cause early life failure. Test methodologies that target the "zero-defect" product quality requirements being pushed by automotive and an increasing number of other applications must address such test escapes by using innovative statistical methods and adaptive testing because of the prohibitive costs of extensive functional and stress/burn-in testing of all parts. The basic idea here is similar to "zero-defect" security screening at airports: parts that pass the initial tests but appear to be "suspect" is some respect are separated out for more extensive tests. Also, additional specialized tests are adaptively added to the test flow to target the suspected failure mode; this requires both the feeding forward and feeding back of results from different stages of the testing process. A few seriously suspect but passing parts may even be discarded outright to ensure quality, if the resulting yield loss is acceptable.Advanced statistical screening methods fall into two broad categories: those that exploit the statistics of defect distribution on wafers - e.g. passing die in "bad" wafer neighborhoods are suspect parts; and those that exploit the correlation in performance parameters in lots and wafers - passing die that are performance outliers relative to matched parts are suspect. This tutorial presents screening methodologies that span both these categories, for both digital and analog parts. We illustrate their effectiveness using results from a number of published experimental studies on production circuits from IBM, Intel, LSI Logic, NXP Semiconductors, and MediaTek. The examples discussed focus on studies where the tests target classical stuck-at faults, as well as IDDQ testing, TDF and path delay timing tests, and also the newly introduced cell aware fault models.Recently, adaptive test methods have been more broadly defined to also include test time reduction techniques based on dynamic test reordering, adaptive scan shift frequency selection for each die, etc. The benefits and challenges of employing these methods are also discussed.Several new companies have emerged targeting the "Adaptive Test" space in recent years. Their commercial offerings are also presented and discussed. Broadly, these aim to provide the software infrastructure and tools needed to support the feed forward and feedback sharing of results from the different test insertions in the test flow for effective test adaptation and optimization. These test results are then utilized by customizable templates to generate automated test selection algorithms that can dynamically apply the most effective test at each test insertion/stage in the test flow, and also perform statistical binning once all testing is complete.

AB  - Stress becomes a significantly serious issue among university students and we need efficient tools to understand it more. The aim of present study is to develop a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to measure the mentioned stress, as pioneer project in Vietnam. In this vein, an item bank of 68 items has been constructed, which is based on Likert Polytomous Scales through five subdomains: behavior, academic performance, family, lecturer and finance. The sampling of the survey is large. It has assessed 2,085 students (704 males and 1,381 females). Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) Model is applied to develop Multidimensional Stress Scales and Computerized Adaptive Testing procedure. The result findings indicate that Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) can be used to develop new scale with psychometric properties. Indicated by various fit criteria MNSQ, standard errors, Z (t-test) implemented in software ConQuest. The subdomain has a good reliability (from .857 to .798). As respect to CATs, a simulated experiment based on the empirical data is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed computerized adaptive testing. The standard error of the estimated stress proficiencies are reported in this study. The 68 items stress data appropriate fit the Multidimensional model applied.

CY  - NA
AB  - Multistage test (MST) designs promise efficient student ability estimates, an indispensable asset for individual diagnostics in high-stakes educational assessments. In high-stakes testing, annually changing test forms are required because publicly known test items impair accurate student ability estimation, and items of bad model fit must be continually replaced to guarantee test quality. This requires a large and continually refreshed item pool as the basis for high-stakes MST. In practice, the calibration of newly developed items to feed annually changing tests is highly resource intensive. Piloting based on a representative sample of students is often not feasible, given that, for schools, participation in actual high-stakes assessments already requires considerable organizational effort. Hence, under practical constraints, the calibration of newly developed items may take place on the go in the form of a concurrent calibration in MST designs. Based on a simulation approach this paper focuses on the performance of Rasch vs. 2PL modeling in retrieving item parameters when items are for practical reasons non-optimally placed in multistage tests. Overall, the results suggest that the 2PL model performs worse in retrieving item parameters compared to the Rasch model when there is non-optimal item assembly in the MST; especially in retrieving parameters at the margins. The higher flexibility of 2PL modeling, where item discrimination is allowed to vary, seems to come at the cost of increased volatility in parameter estimation. Although the overall bias may be modest, single items can be affected by severe biases when using a 2PL model for item calibration in the context of non-optimal item placement.

AB  - Computer Assisted Testing (CAT) system in Indonesia has been commonly used but only to displaying random exam questions and unable to detect the maximum performance of the test participants. This research proposes a simple way with a good level of accuracy in identifying the maximum ability of test participants. By applying the Bayesian probabilistic in the selection of random questions with a weight of difficulties, the system can obtain optimal results from participants compared to sequential questions. The accuracy of the system measured on the choice of questions at the maximum level of the examinee alleged ability by the system, compared to the correct answer from participants gives an average accuracy of 75% compared to 33% sequentially. This technique allows tests to be carried out in a shorter time without repetition, which can affect the fatigue of the test participants in answering questions.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of anxiety expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - Abstract Background/objective Entrepreneurial behavior is of great importance nowadays owing to its significance in the generation of economic, social, personal, and cultural wellbeing. This behavior is influenced by cognitive and personality characteristics, as well as by socioeconomic and contextual factors. Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate entrepreneurial personality. Method A bank of 120 items was created evaluating various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants (M age = 42.34; SDage = 12.96). Results The bank of items had an essentially unidimensional fit to the model. The CAT exhibited high accuracy for evaluating a wide range of <ce><b8> scores, using a mean of 16 items with a very low standard error (M = 0.157). Relative validity evidence for the CAT was obtained with two additional tests of entrepreneurial personality (the Battery for the Assessment of the Enterprising Personality and the Measure of Enterpreneurial Tendencies and Abilities), with correlations of .908 and .657, respectively. Conclusions The CAT developed has appropriate psychometric properties for the evaluation of entrepreneurial people.

CY  - NA
AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3<e2><80><93>9-year-olds. The ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional ...

AB  - Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper and Pencil (P&P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate <ce><b8>. For the item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, <e2><80><a6>, 20, and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of the P&P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S (r > 0.5), (4) the value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the ...

Anhang ; Die vorliegende Dissertation, welche im Rahmen eines DFG-gef<c3><b6>rderten Forschungsprojekts der Medizinischen Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Psychosomatik der Charit<c3><a9> Berlin entstanden ist, hatte die Entwicklung und Validierung eines Computergest<c3><bc>tzten Adaptiven Tests (CAT) zur Angstmessung (Angst-CAT) zum Ziel. Die CAT-Entwicklung geschah auf der Grundlage einer "modernen" Testtheorie, namens "Item Response Theorie" (IRT), die gegen<c3><bc>ber der herk<c3><b6>mmlichen "Klassischen Test-Theorie" (KTT) eine Reihe von messtheoretischen Vorteilen bietet. Es sollte erprobt werden, ob sich diese Vorteile auch in der praktischen Anwendung bei der Konstruktion eines CATs im klinisch-psychologischen Bereich wieder finden lassen. CATs erm<c3><b6>glichen die individuelle Anpassung der Itemdarbietung an die Merkmalsauspr<c3><a4>gung einer Person. Dies geschieht, indem Testpersonen w<c3><a4>hrend der CAT-Bearbeitung nur die Items zur Beantwortung dargeboten werden, welche dem individuellem Auspr<c3><a4>gungsniveau einer Person optimal entsprechen ("adaptives Testen"). Dadurch kann eine deutliche Verringerung der Testl<c3><a4>nge bei einem gleichzeitig konstant hohen Messpr<c3><a4>zisionsniveau erreicht werden. Die IRT-basierte Testentwicklung des Angst-CATs gliedert sich in drei Schritte: (1.) die inhaltliche Auswahl angstrelevanter Items, (2.) die sequentielle statistische Itemanalyse und -selektion dieser Items mit dem Ziel, die Items mit der besten psychometrischen Qualit<c3><a4>t zur Konstruktion einer Itembank zu nutzen und (3.) die Implementierung der Itembank in einen computergest<c3><bc>tzten adaptiven Itemabfolge-Algorithmus, der die Pr<c3><a4>sentation der Items und die Sch<c3><a4>tzung der individuellen Angstauspr<c3><a4>gung von Testpersonen erm<c3><b6>glicht.

AB  - Computer Assisted Testing (CAT) system in Indonesia has been commonly used but only to displaying random exam questions and unable to detect the maximum performance of the test participants. This research proposes a simple way with a good level of accuracy in identifying the maximum ability of test participants. By applying the Bayesian probabilistic in the selection of random questions with a weight of difficulties, the system can obtain optimal results from participants compared to sequential questions. The accuracy of the system measured on the choice of questions at the maximum level of the examinee alleged ability by the system, compared to the correct answer from participants gives an average accuracy of 75% compared to 33% sequentially. This technique allows tests to be carried out in a shorter time without repetition, which can affect the fatigue of the test participants in answering questions.

AB  - Multistage test (MST) designs promise efficient student ability estimates, an indispensable asset for individual diagnostics in high-stakes educational assessments. In high-stakes testing, annually changing test forms are required because publicly known test items impair accurate student ability estimation, and items of bad model fit must be continually replaced to guarantee test quality. This requires a large and continually refreshed item pool as the basis for high-stakes MST. In practice, the calibration of newly developed items to feed annually changing tests is highly resource intensive. Piloting based on a representative sample of students is often not feasible, given that, for schools, participation in actual high-stakes assessments already requires considerable organizational effort. Hence, under practical constraints, the calibration of newly developed items may take place on the go in the form of a concurrent calibration in MST designs. Based on a simulation approach this paper focuses on the performance of Rasch vs. 2PL modeling in retrieving item parameters when items are for practical reasons non-optimally placed in multistage tests. Overall, the results suggest that the 2PL model performs worse in retrieving item parameters compared to the Rasch model when there is non-optimal item assembly in the MST; especially in retrieving parameters at the margins. The higher flexibility of 2PL modeling, where item discrimination is allowed to vary, seems to come at the cost of increased volatility in parameter estimation. Although the overall bias may be modest, single items can be affected by severe biases when using a 2PL model for item calibration in the context of non-optimal item placement.

AB  - This paper analyzes a national technology and education program in Uruguay known as Plan Ceibal. This work studies a sample of over 105,000 students from 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of public primary education in that country. This work aims to assess the impact of technology on teaching and learning of English. The method adopted is based on log-file data to compare two different modalities of English teaching (a face-to-face and a blended model). Additionally, we explored the correlation between a common measure of online engagement when using the Learning Management System (LMS) and an adaptive English assessment. We examined the impact of the teaching modalities on the students engagement and to what extent the engagement can contribute to enhance the student learning of English. This work documents the steps followed to elaborate the common measure of engagement to ensure transparency and its replicability (or improvement). A strength of this work, in comparison with previous studies, is the number of cases analyzed as well as the age of the target population (primary school students). The results indicate that engagement is affected by at least three key factors: socio-cultural context, teaching modality, and the role that teachers play. In fact, the higher the engagement level, the larger the proportion of students who achieve a better learning outcome in the assessment. This study shows that the use of LMS enhanced the learning experience when this tool is integrated within the ecosystem of the teaching and learning process. The findings of this study are consistent with previous works in the field, for instance: the relevance of the context as well as the role of teaching. Although the measurement of engagement can help to understand students performance noteworthy that as a stand-alone dimension it is a poor predictor of performance. To consider additional factors associated with learning is still necessary.

AB  - The cognitive, emotional and motivational inhibition of highly gifted underachievers has become recently a topic of interest for researchers in clinical psychology and psychopathology. In this context the authors wanted to test whether a computerized adaptive test in mathematics could help unblocking the achievement motivation of those students. The main features and principles of construction of the test are described. The results of an exploratory study which was undertaken with 123 students belonging to the second class of a secondary school, 35 of which were highly gifted, stretches the interest of the integration of a CAT into the global treatment procedures of the motivational deficit of highly gifted underachievers.

AB  - Depressive disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and cause substantial harm and affliction as well as reduced quality of life and impaired psychosocial functioning. Apart from the clinical interview, questionnaires represent the most established and economic diagnostic instruments for depression. A multiplicity of questionnaires for depression has been developed across the past decades. However, several studies demonstrated substantial psychometric shortcomings of many depression questionnaires. Thus, further enhancements in this area appear to be mandatory. The present thesis comprises three studies that aim at further improving the quality of diagnostic methods for depression by making the benefits of modern test theoretical approaches, particularly the Rasch-Model, one of the Item-Response-Theory-Models, available for clinical practice. The first study aimed at providing an ample pool of depression items <e2><80><93> the basic requirement for item bank calibration. A thorough review of existing diagnostic tools for depression and relevant literature led to a comprehensive compilation of depression items. Based on the relevance judgments of 49 adept clinical experts 157 relevant items were identified. An additional major finding of Study One was that clinical psychologists tended to regard emotional/ cognitive items as more important than psychiatrists while the latter tended to judge somatic items as more relevant than clinical psychologists. However, across all experts items about somatic complaints were considered as not relevant. The second study was the core of the current thesis and <e2><80><93> based on the item pool of Study One <e2><80><93> aimed at developing a calibrated item bank for depression and evaluating its psychometric properties. Evaluation of Rasch Model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), dimensionality, local independence, item spread, item and person separation, and reliability resulted in a bank of 79 items that showed good psychometric properties. However, a minority of items showed DIF that ...

AB  - Thesis (M.A. (Industrial Psychology))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. ; Selection and selection procedures play a key role in the ability of organisations to compete successfully in the complex global and local environment. South Africa is experiencing a serious artisinal and technical skill shortage. Given the unemployment issues and the quest for people to fill the skill shortage gap it is important for organizations to find possible solutions to ensure that they stay competitive and effective in the labour market. Research suggests that at least 12 500 artisans need to be produced each year from 2006 to 2010 to meet the demand for skilled workers. To address above mentioned challenge organizations have to develop strategies to assist them to select individuals with the best chance to succeed in training. Unfortunately, the solution is not simple as organisations have a multitude of influences and pressures which affect their decisions regarding selection procedures. Selection of individuals is becoming an increasingly complex science as organisations have to select a capable and representative workforce. They must thus select candidates that are most likely to benefit from what is offered educationally, meet the requirements stipulated in South Africa's Labour legislation, and will perform most successfully in the specific trade. Bad practice can lead to costly litigation. The objectives of this mini-dissertation were to assess the empirical validity of the Technical Test Battery (TTB), as ability test and the Learning Potential Computerised Adaptive Test (LPCAT) as learning potential test as predictors of academic success of first year apprentice electrician students at a South African technical college serving a mining community. The study explored the current local employment issues that affect selection for training in the technical fields. The difference between the measurement of cognitive ability and learning potential were examined and the nature of the constructs of cognitive ability and that of learning potential were discussed. In the empirical study one of the objectives was to determine whether there was a relationship between the TTB and the LPCAT as two different predictors of the academic success of first yar apprentice electrician students. The difference in the empirical (predictive) validity of the two psychometric selection instruments, if only one of the tests as opposed to if both were used in combination, were examined. Another objective was to determine if there were any differences regarding the scores on the TTB and LPCAT of students from the designated group as opposed to that of students from non-designated groups. Finally this study explored whether the TTB and LPCAT were valid predictors to be used as selection instruments for apprentice electrician students in the South African context The research method consisted of a literature review and an empirical study. The empirical validity of the two predictor tests was validated in terms of the accuracy with which the selection instruments predicted the students' future performance. This research can be categorized as descriptive quantitative research. The TTB and LPCAT scores of a sample of 89 selected apprentice electricians were compared with the number of attempts they used to pass a phase test. Data was analysed by means of descriptive statistics. Pearsons Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, t-tests, ANOVAs as well as discriminant analysis were also used to reach the research objective. Statistically significant relationships were found between the predictor and criterion variables. The results confirm that the TTB and LPCAT are indeed empirical valid tests that can be used in the selection of apprentice electricians. ; Masters

AB  - Many cutting-edge computer and electronic products are powered by advanced Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Advanced SoCs encompass superb performance together with large number of functions. This is achieved by efficient integration of huge number of transistors. Such very large scale integration is enabled by a core-based design paradigm as well as deep-submicron and 3D-stacked-IC technologies. These technologies are susceptible to reliability and testing complications caused by thermal issues. Three crucial thermal issues related to temperature variations, temperature gradients, and temperature cycling are addressed in this thesis. Existing test scheduling techniques rely on temperature simulations to generate schedules that meet thermal constraints such as overheating prevention. The difference between the simulated temperatures and the actual temperatures is called temperature error. This error, for past technologies, is negligible. However, advanced SoCs experience large errors due to large process variations. Such large errors have costly consequences, such as overheating, and must be taken care of. This thesis presents an adaptive approach to generate test schedules that handle such temperature errors. Advanced SoCs manufactured as 3D stacked ICs experience large temperature gradients. Temperature gradients accelerate certain early-life defect mechanisms. These mechanisms can be artificially accelerated using gradient-based, burn-in like, operations so that the defects are detected before shipping. Moreover, temperature gradients exacerbate some delay-related defects. In order to detect such defects, testing must be performed when appropriate temperature-gradients are enforced. A schedule-based technique that enforces the temperature-gradients for burn-in like operations is proposed in this thesis. This technique is further developed to support testing for delay-related defects while appropriate gradients are enforced. The last thermal issue addressed by this thesis is related to temperature cycling. Temperature cycling test procedures are usually applied to safety-critical applications to detect cycling-related early-life failures. Such failures affect advanced SoCs, particularly through-silicon-via structures in 3D-stacked-ICs. An efficient schedule-based cycling-test technique that combines cycling acceleration with testing is proposed in this thesis. The proposed technique fits into existing 3D testing procedures and does not require temperature chambers. Therefore, the overall cycling acceleration and testing cost can be drastically reduced. All the proposed techniques have been implemented and evaluated with extensive experiments based on ITC<e2><80><99>02 benchmarks as well as a number of 3D stacked ICs. Experiments show that the proposed techniques work effectively and reduce the costs, in particular the costs related to addressing thermal issues and early-life failures. We have also developed a fast temperature simulation technique based on a closed-form solution for the temperature equations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed simulation technique reduces the schedule generation time by more than half.

Admission to University is accompanied by the transition to a new educational system, new social environment, which causes need for adaptating first-year students to the educational process. The article considers social, pedagogical and psychological factor, both positive and negative affecting the pedagogical process and the content of systematic adaptation while educating first-year students in the conditions of a University branch. Under conditions of realizing federal state educational standards of higher professional education it is estimated that adaptation is possible by means of individualizing instructions and implementing objective approach into teaching all courses including Physics. The article offers some ways of solving the problem of educational adaptation given on the basis of teaching first-year students Physics at a Polytechnicsâ€™ branch.

TI  - Response of Unsaturated Soils Under Monotonic and Dynamic Loading over Moderate Suction States
JO  - NA
VL  - NA
PY  - 2017
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - The understanding of the mechanical behavior of the unsaturated soils has been significantly enhanced due to the recent advancement of technology and modifications to the conventional testing devices. However, the implementation of the concepts of unsaturated soil has lagged, mainly due to the risks associated with the development of civil infrastructure based on practically untested theories and the limited reliable prediction methods for compacted, expansive, residual, and collapsible soils, which requires reliable and comprehensive experimental data. Moreover, the tests on unsaturated soils are enormously time consuming and often exorbitantly expensive, which further hinders the use of unsaturated soil mechanics in practical applications. Additionally, the liquefaction of cohesionless soils has predominantly been considered only for saturated soils. However, the soils with high degree of saturation, yet partially saturated, which are mostly near the ground surface and have low overburden pressure, may liquefy during earthquakes. Since plenty of unsaturated cohesionless soils are present near high seismic activity zones, the susceptibility of these soils to liquefy needs to be studied. Addressing these problems has been the main objective of the present dissertation research. The characteristics of compacted soils were studied by performing an elaborate series of suction-controlled monotonic triaxial tests on compacted silty soil specimens following the hydrostatic compression (HC) and the conventional triaxial compression (CTC) stress paths at varying net mean stresses and matric suction levels. The multistage triaxial tests were performed on the silty soil specimens at varying suction levels using a new approach to address the issues related to soil variability and to significantly reduce the testing time while maintaining the reliability of the test results. The Barcelona Basic Model (BBM) framework was used to reproduce experimental test results both from suction-controlled single-stage and multistage triaxial tests. Hence the BBM was indirectly used to demonstrate the utility of multistage triaxial tests in replicating test results or predictions similar to single-stage triaxial testing. The influence of suction, unit weight, and wetting and drying of the compacted specimens of silty soil on the resilient modulus was also studied by performing a comprehensive series of suction-controlled repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests over a wide range of suction to address the issue of repeatability of RLT tests. In this dissertation research, the tendency of the soil in unsaturated condition to liquefy was studied by performing cyclic triaxial tests on suction-equilibrated silty sand specimens. A series of cyclic triaxial tests were performed in undrained conditions at varying suction states and cyclic stress ratios to assess the liquefaction potential of the soil at varying relative densities and matric suction levels. The findings from this dissertation research would assist in the development of future constitutive models for predicting the response of dilatant soils in unsaturated conditions subjected to monotonic and dynamic loading.

At the same time, the governance of the education system and schools<e2><80><99> organizations have been exposed to unprecedented tensions. The pandemic emergency has been a lens revealing intersections and structural tensions among various level and actors of the education system, but also allowing opportunities of changes thanks to the exogenous shock. At the same time, it must be considered that the emergency is interacting on pre-existing inequalities and contradictions. Higher education systems have been affected too: in constant evolution due to constant transformations of society and changed functions of knowledge, universities have undergone a structural change along with pandemic times. Simultaneously, the growing relevance of knowledge for the economic development of the capitalistic system has profoundly affected higher education systems, characterized by the neo-liberal approach which his subject of increasing critical analysis. ; In this paper we present results on the estimation of mathematics skills of Italian grade 10 students with special educational needs. The estimation was carried out by means of a com-puter based multilevel adaptive test 1 - 3 - 3 (MST) constructed within the framework of a doctoral research in Social, Developmental and Educational Research Psychology. An item bank was used to construct the MST test. Verification of the unidimensionality of the bank was done through exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and analysis of model fit indices with Rasch's model (Rasch, 1960) being calibrated. Verification of the best measurement properties of the test compared to a linear test was performed by comparing information functions. It is shown that this type of test is able to provide estimates of the ability of students with a con-siderable level of ...

AB  - We used the Dutch-Flemish version of the USA PROMIS adult V1.0 item bank for Anxiety as input for developing a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure the entire latent anxiety continuum. First, psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample (N = 2,010) showed that the 29-item bank has psychometric properties that are required for a CAT administration. Second, a post hoc CAT simulation showed efficient and highly precise measurement, with an average number of 8.64 items for the clinical sample, and 9.48 items for the general population sample. Furthermore, the accuracy of our CAT version was highly similar to that of the full item bank administration, both in final score estimates and in distinguishing clinical subjects from persons without a mental health disorder. We discuss the future directions and limitations of CAT development with the Dutch-Flemish version of the PROMIS Anxiety item bank. ; Stress-related psychiatric disorders across the life span

AB  - <c5><9e>enel, Selma (Balikesir Author) ; This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

AB  - Recently, adaptive test approaches have become a viable alternative to traditional fixed-item tests. The main advantage of adaptive tests is that they reach desired measurement precision with fewer items. However, fewer items mean that each item has a more significant effect on ability estimation and therefore those tests are open to more consequential results from any flaw in an item. So, any items indicating differential item functioning (DIF) may play an important role in examinees&#039; test scores. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effect of DIF items on the performance of computer adaptive and multi-stage tests. For this purpose, different test designs were tested under different test lengths and ratios of DIF items using Monte Carlo simulation. As a result, it was seen that computer adaptive test (CAT) designs had the best measurement precision over all conditions. When multi-stage test (MST) panel designs were compared, it was found that the 1-3-3 design had higher measurement precision in most of the conditions; however, the findings were not enough to say that 1-3-3 design performed better than the 1-2-4 design. Furthermore, CAT was found to be the least affected design by the increase of ratio of DIF items. MST designs were affected by that increment especially in the 10-item length test. ; Recently, adaptive test approaches have become a viable alternative to traditional fixed-item tests.

AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing a high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adatpive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators' responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback by solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

AB  - Although high unemployment rates exist in many countries of the world, companies continue to struggle to hire candidates whose personality traits and competencies match their needs. High unemployment rates and a global talent shortage can be seen as a fascinating contradiction that merits future research. This study investigates suitable personnel selection methods that assist recruiters in seeking the right person with the potential to contribute most to a business. It consolidates theories about personnel selection in a cross-national setting and link them with specific personality traits, job competencies, and person-organization fit (P-O fit) that could predict and enhance employee outcomes. The Most Valuable Employees and Average Contribution Employees can be classified by using Data Envelopment analysis (DEA) and Na<c3><af>ve Bayesian analysis based on a set of standards. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), different aspects of personality traits, employee competencies, P-O fit, and biographic information, these characteristics are found to influence the key workplace outcomes in the United States and China. In both countries, the three dimensions in the HEXACO personality inventory (Honesty-Humility, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience) are found to significantly effect the workplace outcomes. In addition, job competencies, and P-O fit are also proven to be significantly associated with the key work outcomes in these two countries. There are several limitations in this study associated with a relative small number of primary data collected from them. However, this study employs a web-based dynamic survey system to save time, improve the response rate, and provide assessment accuracy. Furthermore, DEA and Na<c3><af>ve Bayesian classifiers help to separate the Most Valuable Employees from other employees, which may have practical significance for both researchers and practitioners.

CY  - NA
AB  - Item parameter drift (IPD) is the systematic differentiation of parameter values of items over time due to various reasons. If it occurs in computer adaptive tests (CAT), it causes errors in the estimation of item and ability parameters. Identification of the underlying conditions of this situation in CAT is important for estimating item and ability parameters with minimum error. This study examines the measurement precision of IPD and its impacts on the test information function (TIF) in CAT administrations. This simulation study compares sample size (1000, 5000), IPD size (0.00 logit, 0.50 logit, 0.75 logit, 1.00 logit), percentage of items containing IPD (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%), three time points and item bank size (200, 500, 1000) conditions. To examine the impacts of the conditions on ability estimations; measurement precision, and TIF values were calculated, and factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent samples was carried out to examine whether there were any differences between estimations in terms of these factors. The study found that an increase in the number of measurements using item bank with IPD items results in a decrease in measurement precision and the amount of information the test provides. Factorial ANOVA for independent samples revealed that measurements precision and TIF differences are mostly statistically significant. Although all IPD conditions negatively affect measurement precision and TIF, it has been shown that sample size and item bank size generally do not have an increasing or decreasing effect on these factors. ; Item parameter drift (IPD) is the systematic differentiation of parameter values of items over time due to various reasons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; aged 7-17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. RESULTS: Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

AB  - To investigate differential item functioning (DIF) of PROMIS Depression items between US and German samples we compared data from the US PROMIS calibration sample (n = 780), a German general population survey (n = 2,500) and a German clinical sample (n = 621). DIF was assessed in an ordinal logistic regression framework, with 0.02 as criterion for R2 -change and 0.096 for Raju's non-compensatory DIF. Item parameters were initially fixed to the PROMIS Depression metric; we used plausible values to account for uncertainty in depression estimates. Only four items showed DIF. Accounting for DIF led to negligible effects for the full item bank as well as a post hoc simulated computer-adaptive test (< 0.1 point on the PROMIS metric [mean = 50, standard deviation =10]), while the effect on the short forms was small (< 1 point). The mean depression severity (43.6) in the German general population sample was considerably lower compared to the US reference value of 50. Overall, we found little evidence for language DIF between US and German samples, which could be addressed by either replacing the DIF items by items not showing DIF or by scoring the short form in German samples with the corrected item parameters reported.

AB  - PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important patient-reported outcome in clinical and health research. The EQ-5D-Y assesses child and adolescent HRQoL by five items on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) on the current health state. This study investigates predictors of self-reported HRQoL according to the EQ-5D-Y in chronically ill children and adolescents using longitudinal data. METHODS: Data from the German Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes, and juvenile arthritis gathered over a period of six months were analyzed (n = 310; 7-17 years old; 48% female). Self-, parent-, and pediatrician-reported data were collected from June 2013 to October 2014. Generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models served to examine effects of socio-demographic as well as disease- and health-specific predictors on the items as well as on the VAS of the EQ-5D-Y. RESULTS: Ceiling effects for the EQ-5D-Y indicated low burden of disease in the analyzed sample. Longitudinal analyses revealed associations between less health complaints and better HRQoL for all investigated HRQoL domains. Further, age- and gender-specific effects, and associations of better disease control, longer duration of the disease and less mental health problems with better HRQoL were found. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective health complaints and mental health problems should be considered in the care of children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes, and juvenile arthritis. Future research should suggest administering the items of the EQ-5D-Y with five instead of three response options, and investigate HRQoL over a longer period.

AB  - International audience ; SRAM testing is becoming more and more challenging due to issues caused by continuous device scaling. Fabricated SRAMs are submitted to random and systematic process variability, which strongly affect the cell's behavior and also the ability of test algorithms to detect faults. Traditionally, bias conditions have been used to improve the behavior of the SRAM under process variations by applying body bias to compensate for the effect of variability. Based on the same principle, bias conditions also affect the cell's behavior when resistive-opens are present, hence affecting test's defect coverage capability. Both body- and source-bias conditions are analyzed in this paper to find the way to improve defect detect ability in the SRAM cell. Source-biasing has been proven to be the more effective of the two, leading to more than 3X improvement of the defect detected value. Also, by adapting the source-bias conditions to process parameter values, over- and under-testing of the SRAM can be avoided.

AB  - Backgound: Assessing specific personality traits has shown better predictive power of enterprising personality than have broad personality traits. Hitherto, there have been no instruments that evaluate the combination of specific personality traits of enterprising personality in an adaptive format. So, the aim was to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) to assess enterprising personality in young people. Methods: A pool of 161 items was developed and applied to two sets of participants (n1 = 357 students, Mage = 17.89; SDage = 3.26; n2 = 2,693 students; Mage = 16.52, SDage = 1.38) using a stratified sampling method. Results: 107 items that assess achievement motivation, risk-taking, innovativeness, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, internal locus of control, and optimism were selected. The assumption of unidimensionality was tested. The CAT demonstrated high precision for a wide range of q, using a mean of 10 items and demonstrating a relatively low Standard Error (0.378). Conclusions: A brief, valid, and precise instrument was obtained with relevant implications for educational and entrepreneurial contexts. ; Un Test Adaptativo Informatizado para la evaluaci<c3><b3>n de la personalidad emprendedora en j<c3><b3>venes.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

AB  - Stress becomes a significantly serious issue among university students and we need efficient tools to understand it more. The aim of present study is to develop a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to measure the mentioned stress, as pioneer project in Vietnam. In this vein, an item bank of 68 items has been constructed, which is based on Likert Polytomous Scales through five subdomains: behavior, academic performance, family, lecturer and finance. The sampling of the survey is large. It has assessed 2,085 students (704 males and 1,381 females). Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) Model is applied to develop Multidimensional Stress Scales and Computerized Adaptive Testing procedure. The result findings indicate that Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) can be used to develop new scale with psychometric properties. Indicated by various fit criteria MNSQ, standard errors, Z (t-test) implemented in software ConQuest. The subdomain has a good reliability (from .857 to .798). As respect to CATs, a simulated experiment based on the empirical data is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed computerized adaptive testing. The standard error of the estimated stress proficiencies are reported in this study. The 68 items stress data appropriate fit the Multidimensional model applied.

Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate entrepreneurial personality. Method A bank of 120 items was created evaluating various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants (M age = 42.34; SDage = 12.96).

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of anxiety expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

TI  - Is a Computerized Adaptive Test More Motivating Than a Fixed-Item Test?
JO  - NA

CY  - NA
AB  - Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous studies.

AB  - BackgroundSeparation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common mental disorders among children and adolescents, and it may seriously affect their growth, daily life, and learning. Self-report scales have been used for diagnosis, which require lengthy testing and personnel.MethodsA total of 1,241 adolescents were recruited from 16 junior- and senior-high schools in China. The initial item bank was selected from classical SAD scales according to the DSM-5. First, the optimal model was selected using item response theory (IRT) according to data fit. Then, per the IRT analysis, items that did not meet the psychometric requirements were deleted (e.g., discriminating values < 0.2). Consequently, a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for SAD was formed (CAT-SAD).ResultsAn average of 17 items per participant was required to achieve and maintain a 0.3 standard error of measurement in the SAD severity estimate. The estimated correlation of the CAT-SAD with the total 68-item test score was 0.955. CAT-SAD scores were strongly related to the probability of a SAD diagnosis with the Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale<e2><80><94>Child and Adolescent Version. Therefore, SAD could be accurately predicted by the CAT-SAD.ConclusionsExploratory factor analyses revealed that SAD was unidimensional. The CAT-SAD, which has good reliability and validity and high sensitivity and specificity, provides an efficient test for adolescents with SAD as compared to standard paper-and-pencil tests. It can be used to diagnose varying degrees of SAD quickly and reliably and ease the burden on adolescents. Potential applications for inexpensive, efficient, and accurate screening of SAD are discussed.

AB  - Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper and Pencil (P&P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate <ce><b8>. For the item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, <e2><80><a6>, 20, and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of the P&P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S (r > 0.5), (4) the value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the ...

AB  - Although much work has been done on computerized-adaptive test (CAT) in reducing anxiety towards exam, CAT in Malaysian educational setting is less explored among educational researchers. Some of the reason is due to technical difficulty in developing, maintaining the testing bank items, and insufficient hardware facilities for huge number of examinees in Malaysia. Hence, traditional assessment method is preferred to assess students<e2><80><99> performance. However, traditional assessment induced students<e2><80><99> anxiety towards examination. The effect of anxiety towards mathematics examination has deteriorated students<e2><80><99> performance particularly at polytechnics that offers technical-vocational-education-and-training (TVET). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of CAT in reducing examinees<e2><80><99> anxiety towards mathematics examination in comparison with traditional testing approaches at three polytechnics in northern Malaysia that offered diploma certification in engineering. These three polytechnics were chosen because it is classified as conventional and accessibility of the researchers to these samples. In order to ensure the homogeneity of the samples, students in their first year of study who enrolled in engineering mathematics were chosen. This research used quasi-experimental research method with non-equivalent control group design involving 300 students. Item-response-theory was used to describe examinees<e2><80><99> interaction with the test items. The results show that CAT has reduced examinees<e2><80><99> anxiety towards mathematics test in comparison to those of traditional testing. This study implies that CAT has benefited students in term of reducing their anxiety towards mathematics examination in the case of Malaysian polytechnics students, and has the potential to be adopted in TVET because it improves testing efficiency.

AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3<e2><80><93>9-year-olds. The ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional ...

AB  - The Musical Emotion Discrimination Task (MEDT) is a short, non-adaptive test of the ability to discriminate emotions in music. Test-takers hear two performances of the same melody, both played by the same performer but each trying to communicate a different basic emotion, and are asked to determine which one is â€œhappierâ€, for example. The goal of the current study was to construct a new version of the MEDT using a larger set of shorter, more diverse music clips and an adaptive framework to expand the ability range for which the test can deliver measurements. The first study analysed responses from a large sample of participants (N = 624) to determine how musical features contributed to item difficulty, which resulted in a quantitative model of musical emotion discrimination ability rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT). This model informed the construction of the adaptive MEDT. A second study contributed preliminary evidence for the validity and reliability of the adaptive MEDT, and demonstrated that the new version of the test is suitable for a wider range of abilities. This paper therefore presents the first adaptive musical emotion discrimination test, a new resource for investigating emotion processing which is freely available for research use.

AB  - PURPOSE: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for depression in the general adult population. Although screening questionnaires for depression and anxiety exist in primary care settings, electronic health tools such as computerized adaptive tests based on item response theory can advance screening practices. This study evaluated the validity of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) for screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) and assessing MDD and anxiety severity among adult primary care patients. METHODS: We approached 402 English-speaking adults for participation from a primary care clinic, of whom 271 adults (71% female, 65% black) participated. Participants completed modules from the CAT-MH (Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD, CAT<e2><80><93>Depression Inventory, CAT<e2><80><93>Anxiety Inventory); brief paper questionnaires (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]); and a reference-standard interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) Diagnoses. RESULTS: On the basis of the interview, 31 participants met criteria for MDD and 29 met criteria for GAD. The diagnostic accuracy of the Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD (area under curve [AUC] = 0.85) was similar to that of the PHQ-9 (AUC = 0.84) and higher than that of the PHQ-2 (AUC = 0.76) for MDD screening. Using the interview as the reference standard, the accuracy of the CAT<e2><80><93>Anxiety Inventory (AUC = 0.93) was similar to that of the GAD-7 (AUC = 0.97) for assessing anxiety severity. The patient-preferred screening method was assessment via tablet/computer with audio. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized adaptive testing could be a valid and efficient patient-centered screening strategy for depression and anxiety screening in primary care settings.

AB  - In the past, a German Computerized Adaptive Test, based on Item Response Theory (IRT), was developed for purposes of assessing the construct depression [Computerâ€adaptive test for depression (Dâ€CAT)]. This study aims at testing the feasibility and validity of the real computerâ€adaptive application. The Dâ€CAT, supplied by a bank of 64 items, was administered on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a predetermined reliability (r â‰¥ 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESâ€D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)]. The Dâ€CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds), well accepted by the patients and reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95% of the cases, 10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between the Dâ€CAT and the HADS, CESâ€D, and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The Dâ€CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established questionnaires do. The Dâ€CAT proved an efficient, well accepted and reliable tool. Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures, whereby the CAT is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item selection for content in the future.

AB  - Background: Universal screening is a critical component within a multi-tiered system of supports because it is the first mechanism by which students are identified as at-risk for failure. Screeners must have adequate psychometric properties to accurately identify students at-risk, however many measures result in moderate accuracy, indicating the presence of false negatives and false positives. These errors may affect the allocation of resources in schools, sometimes causing resources to be utilized unnecessarily and other times withholding services when they are needed. Purpose: This study examined the validity and diagnostic accuracy of a reading CAT using single time points and slopes within year, and longitudinally across one and two years. Methods: Screening and state test data were analyzed for students in third through fifth grade (N = 1696). Validity statistics were calculated using single time points and slopes on the CAT. Diagnostic accuracy analyses included the use of ROC curves to identify the CAT cut score associated with maximized sensitivity and specificity, and the cut score at the 25th and 40th percentile. Results: Correlation results for single screener points and the state test ranged from .60 to .79 (p = .0001). Correlation between slopes and the state test were weak for third and fourth grade (.21 and .14, respectively, p = .0001) and not significant for fifth grade. When ROC curves were used to identify the cut score associated with maximized sensitivity and specificity, overall accuracy was high for single points and moderate for slopes. Accuracy remained high for the cut score at the 25th and 40th percentile, though sensitivity levels were lower for the 25th percentile. Slopes yielded inadequate levels of sensitivity. Conclusion: Results suggest CATs may address issues of inadequate levels of diagnostic accuracy found in the screening literature but additional research is needed in samples with different base rates. ; Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, Department of

AB  - Alternate testing techniques have been progressively adopted as a promising solution due to their effectiveness against classical specification-based test methods. This work presents a built-in test system, which adaptively generates an indirect digital signature characterising the circuit under test, which is later used to diagnose the actual performances relying on a statistical dictionary-based diagnosis method. The system is composed of an integrated digital signature generator and a digital control and acquisition subsystem. The signature generator is based on a converter architecture, in which the analogue range can be adapted to the magnitude of the indirect measure using the well known information of the fault-free circuit. The digital subsystem controls the proposed architecture and stores the digital codes sent by the integrated digital signature generator. The digital signature generator has been designed and fabricated in an industrial 65 nm complementary metal<e2><80><93>oxide<e2><80><93>semiconductor technology from STMicroelectronics, whereas the digital control and acquisition subsystem have been prototyped in a field-programmable gate array. The fabricated system has been used to test a biquad filter affected by parametric variations. Successful experimental results are reported showing the capabilities of the proposed adaptive test system to diagnose circuit performances with discrepancies as low as 1% of the actual real value. ; Postprint (published version)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk-assessments need to be validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of a highly efficient computer adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among SGMY. METHODS: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n=1,073) and at their follow-up visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity were performed. RESULTS: Younger, assigned female at birth, non-monosexual (e.g., bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender non-conforming or non-gender binary (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior wave. CONCLUSIONS: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, non-monosexual, and gender non-conforming or non-gender binary.

CY  - NA
AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3<e2><80><93>9-year-olds. The ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3<e2><80><93>9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional ...

PB  - Oxford University Press (OUP)
CY  - NA
AB  - Background Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. Design This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Methods Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. Results On average, patients took about 1.5 minutes (SD &lt;2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal clinically important improvement. Limitations Because this study was a secondary analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future studies would benefit from more complete data. Conclusions The results indicate the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

This research proposes a simple way with a good level of accuracy in identifying the maximum ability of test participants. By applying the Bayesian probabilistic in the selection of random questions with a weight of difficulties, the system can obtain optimal results from participants compared to sequential questions. The accuracy of the system measured on the choice of questions at the maximum level of the examinee alleged ability by the system, compared to the correct answer from participants gives an average accuracy of 75% compared to 33% sequentially. This technique allows tests to be carried out in a shorter time without repetition, which can affect the fatigue of the test participants in answering questions.

AB  - A sensitivity analysis in an observational study determines the magnitude of bias from nonrandom treatment assignment that would need to be present to alter the qualitative conclusions of a na\"{\i}ve analysis that presumes all biases were removed by matching or by other analytic adjustments. The power of a sensitivity analysis and the design sensitivity anticipate the outcome of a sensitivity analysis under an assumed model for the generation of the data. It is known that the power of a sensitivity analysis is affected by the choice of test statistic, and, in particular, that a statistic with good Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment, such as Wilcoxon's signed rank statistic, may have low power in a sensitivity analysis and low design sensitivity when compared to other statistics. For instance, for an additive treatment effect and errors that are Normal or logistic or $t$-distributed with 3 degrees of freedom, Brown's combined quantile average test has Pitman efficiency close to that of Wilcoxon's test but has higher power in a sensitivity analysis, while a version of Noether's test has poor Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment but much higher design sensitivity so it is vastly more powerful than Wilcoxon's statistic in a sensitivity analysis if the sample size is sufficiently large. ; Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/11-AOAS508 the Annals of Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)

The number of items saved and the estimated person measures was compared between the results of MCAT and NAT, respectively. Results MCAT yielded substantially more precise measurements and was considerably more efficient than NAT. MCAT achieved 20.19% (= [53 <e2><88><92> 42.3]/53) saving in item length when the measurement differences were less than 5%. Pearson correlation coefficients were highly consistent among the eight domains. The cut-off points for the overall measures were <e2><88><92> 1.4, <e2><88><92> 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 logits, which was equivalent to 20% for each portion in percentile scores. Substantially fewer items were answered through MCAT than through NAT without compromising the precision of MCAT. Conclusions Developing a website that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, and smartphones to help them perform online screening and prediction of dementia in older adults is useful and manageable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design a new measure of caregiver-specific anxiety for use in caregivers of individuals with TBI, the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Specific-Anxiety item bank. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: 344 caregivers of civilians with TBI and 216 caregivers of service members/veterans with TBI. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety Item Bank RESULTS: The retention of 40 caregiver-specific anxiety items was supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning analyses supported the retention of 33 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM calibration data was used to select a 6-item static short form, and GRM calibration data was used to program the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety computer adaptive test (CAT). CONCLUSIONS: Established, rigorous measurement development standards were used to develop the new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety CAT and corresponding 6-item short form. This measure is the first patient-reported outcome measure (PRO) designed to assess caregiver-specific anxiety in caregivers of individuals with TBI. The measure exhibits strong psychometric properties.

AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD. ; M.Sc.

AB  - After the stability and sensitivity of FLOR were investigated, the application of it in the CAT environment had become the main concern. The present studies found that both the test length and the number of exposed items affect the final value of FLOR. In the fixed length CAT, the FLOR has a much stronger sensitivity than lz and CUSUM in detecting item pre-knowledge. The sensitivity of FLOR in the fixed length CAT was the same as that in the fixed length fixed items test. If the test length could vary, the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT would be slightly weakened. The Adjusted FLOR index could increase the sensitivity. Concerning about the effect of ability on the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT, it was found that the abilities of the test takers in CAT did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR and Adjusted FLOR. ; Item response theory is a modern test theory. It focuses on the performance of each item. Under this framework, the performance of test takers on a test item can be predicted by a set of abilities. The relationship between the test takers' item performances and the set of abilities underlying item performances can be described by a monotonically increasing function called an item characteristic curve. Due to various personal reasons, the performances of the test takers may depart from the response patterns predicted by the underlying test model. In order to calculate the extent of departure of these aberrant response patterns, a number of methods have been developed under the theme "person-fit statistics". The degree of aberration is calculated as an index called person-fit index. Inside the computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test takers with different abilities will answer different numbers of questions and the difficulties of the items administered to them are usually clustered at the abilities of the test takers. Due to this reason, the application of person-fit indices in the computerized adaptive testing environment to measure misfit is difficult. ; The present study also found that FLOR has a much ...

AB  - Compressor fouling is one of the main causes of gas turbine performance degradation. Microsized particles adhere to the blade surfaces increasing the surface roughness and modifying the airfoil shape. In this work, the contamination of the Allison 250 C18 multistage compressor engine with four sorts of micrometric dust has been provided. The tests were performed changing the relative humidity (RH) at the compressor inlet and the unit rotational speed. After each test, a photographic inspection of the internal fouled parts has been realized and the digital pictures have been analyzed employing an image processing package. The deposit's build-up of stator vanes and rotor blades has been postprocessed and the most affected regions of each compressor stage have been highlighted. Besides, a numerical simulation of the machine has been performed. The numerical flow field has been used to highlight the blade regions, which show the most favorable conditions for particle deposition. A theoretical model has been applied to the flow field to simulate the particle deposition. The combination of the deposition model with the results of the numerical simulations gives the chance to better understand the experimentally founded deposition patterns. Those results have been finally compared to the pictures of the patterns. The possibility to detect and measure the deposition patterns on a rotating test rig and the comparison with models and experiments gave the possibility to assess in detail the particle deposition phenomenon on a multistage axial compressor flow path.

JO  - NA

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - Land-based power units have to fulfill even more high levels of production and reliability. In harsh environments (desert and tropical installations, typically), the power unit ingests high amounts of dust that might deposit inside the compressor. In this paper, the analysis of a multistage compressor performance that operates under sandy and humid conditions has been assessed. The compressor units, which equips the Allison 250 C18 compressor, has been subjected to multiple runs under severe conditions of soil dust ingestion. The compressor has been operated according to subsequent runs, and at the end of each run, the performance curve was recorded; the performance losses, in terms of pressure ratio, have been measured during the operations. The characteristic curve of each run is representative of the level of contamination of the unit. Finally, the compressor has been washed, and the performance curve, in the recovered conditions, has been recorded. The results show the modification and the downward shift of the characteristic curves which lead to a gradual loss of the compressor performance. The curves realized after dust ingestion have been compared with the recovered curve after online washing. The measurement shows a promising recovery of the performances, even if the compressor flow path appears affected by localized deposits able to resist to the droplet removal action. Detailed photographic reports of the inlet guide vane (IGV) and the first compressor stages have been included in this analysis. After each run, the IGV, the rotor blade and stator vane of the first stage, and the hub and the shroud surfaces have been photographed. The pictures show the deposition patterns on the blades and the compressor surfaces. The comparison of the pictures of the internal surfaces, before and after the washing, highlights the parts that are more critical to clean and needy of attention during offline washing and overhaul.

The researcher sought to describe the level of assessment literacy that teachers demonstrate when using score report data from computer-adaptive interim assessment and to analyze whether teachers<e2><80><99> assessment literacy seems to be affected by: a) the quality of professional development training received; b) teachers<e2><80><99> level of self-efficacy; c) teachers<e2><80><99> attribution to student effort, that is their perception of the importance of student effort; and d) teachers<e2><80><99> attribution to context, specifically their perception of the importance of tests. For this study, a relevant measurement instrument, the Assessment Literacy Skills for Computer Adaptive Tests (ALS-CAT), was designed to provide valid and reliable inferences about assessment literacy skills related to computer-adaptive tests. In addition to the ALS-CAT, the sample of 88 teachers responded to the Multidimensional Multiattributional Causality Scale (MMCS), the Data-Driven Decision-Making Efficacy Anxiety (3DMEA) inventory, and questions quantifying their perception of the quality of professional development experienced. Descriptive and explanatory correlational statistical analysis found no statistically significant relationships between respondents' scores on assessment literacy and respondents' scores on the perceived quality of professional development, perceived self-efficacy, attribution to student effort, or attribution to context. Additional analysis found a relationship between the perceived quality of professional development and perceived self-efficacy.

AB  - Gas turbine particle ingestion may lead to the deposition of contaminants in the compressor section, inducing the performance losses of the whole engine. The economic losses derived from this issue push great interest in the investigation of such a phenomenon from a numerical and experimental standpoint. This paper describes a quantitative approach to predict particle deposition on the vanes of an axial compressor starting from the flow field obtained employing CFD simulations. The results are then compared to the experiments performed on the Allison 250 C18 compressor unit subject to particle ingestion under controlled conditions. The results derived from the experimental and numerical investigations are presented, providing insight into the mass deposited on the vanes and the corresponding zones most affected by the particle deposition issue. The numerical model showed good agreement in the estimation of the predicted values of the deposited mass and the corresponding patterns through the compressor stages. The low-complexity approach proposed here, helps the designer to predict the contamination of the stationary rows starting from a simple set of single-phase numerical results. Furthermore, with the implementation of this approach into the design path, the designer could reduce the impact of fouling, looking at the effects of their solutions under the foulingreduction light.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

AB  - Paper 106561R, 8 S. ; The Group for Quality Assurance and Industrial Image Processing has built a new experimental setup to characterize cameras and image sensors according to EMVA1288 standard. Next to the investigation of SLN (Sensitivity-Linearity- Noise) and spatial non-uniformities, the new test bench also provides an examination of the temperature dependence of sensors. The temperature dependent dark current produces an undesirable signal which affects the image quality negative and thus has to be known. It is caused by thermally induced electrons and increases linearly with exposure time as well as exponentially with temperature. To measure the dark current, it is necessary to vary and determine the temperature of the sensor. This was made possible by a climate chamber with a Peltier element, which enables a heating and cooling of the camera. An infrared sensor allows a contact-free detection of the actual camera temperature. Furthermore, the light source was improved for the new test bench. With the installed custom light source and integration sphere a homogeneous irradiation up to 97% is ensured. This way better results in tests were achieved. The light source with variable filter housing enables the use of monochromatically light in a wavelength range of 350 - 1700nm. A live monitoring of the irradiation during the image capturing is possible. A MATLAB script assists in the configuration of the camera, the measurement and the data storage. The user is guided step by step through the program. At the end of the measurements an automated evaluation follows, which illustrates graphs and parameters in a streamlined and print-ready format.

TI  - Is a Computerized Adaptive Test More Motivating Than a Fixed-Item Test?
JO  - NA
VL  - NA

CY  - NA
AB  - Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous studies.

AB  - Although much work has been done on computerized-adaptive test (CAT) in reducing anxiety towards exam, CAT in Malaysian educational setting is less explored among educational researchers. Some of the reason is due to technical difficulty in developing, maintaining the testing bank items, and insufficient hardware facilities for huge number of examinees in Malaysia. Hence, traditional assessment method is preferred to assess students<e2><80><99> performance. However, traditional assessment induced students<e2><80><99> anxiety towards examination. The effect of anxiety towards mathematics examination has deteriorated students<e2><80><99> performance particularly at polytechnics that offers technical-vocational-education-and-training (TVET). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of CAT in reducing examinees<e2><80><99> anxiety towards mathematics examination in comparison with traditional testing approaches at three polytechnics in northern Malaysia that offered diploma certification in engineering. These three polytechnics were chosen because it is classified as conventional and accessibility of the researchers to these samples. In order to ensure the homogeneity of the samples, students in their first year of study who enrolled in engineering mathematics were chosen. This research used quasi-experimental research method with non-equivalent control group design involving 300 students. Item-response-theory was used to describe examinees<e2><80><99> interaction with the test items. The results show that CAT has reduced examinees<e2><80><99> anxiety towards mathematics test in comparison to those of traditional testing. This study implies that CAT has benefited students in term of reducing their anxiety towards mathematics examination in the case of Malaysian polytechnics students, and has the potential to be adopted in TVET because it improves testing efficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current suicide risk screening and measurement are inefficient, have limited measurement precision, and focus entirely on suicide-related items. For this study, a psychometric harmonization between related suicide, depression, and anxiety symptom domains that provides a more balanced and complete spectrum of suicidal symptomatology was developed. The objective of this article is to describe the results of the early stages of computerized adaptive testing development for a suicide scale and pave the way for the final stage of validation. METHODS: Data from psychiatric outpatients at the University of Pittsburgh and a community health clinic were collected from January 2010 through June 2012. 789 participants were enrolled in the calibration phase; 70% were female, and 30% were male. The rate of major depressive disorder as diagnosed by DSM-5 was 47%. The item bank contained 1,008 items related to depression, anxiety, and mania, including 11 suicide items. Data were analyzed using a bifactor model to identify a core dimension between suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and mania items. A computerized adaptive test was developed via simulation from the actual complete item responses in 308 subjects. RESULTS: 111 items were identified that provided an extension of suicidality assessment to include statistically related responses from depression and anxiety domains that are syndromally associated with suicidality. All items had high loadings on the primary suicide dimension (average = 0.67; range, 0.49-0.88). Analyses revealed that a mean of 10 items (5-20) had a correlation of 0.96 with the 111-item scale, with a precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale metric. Preliminary validation data based on 290 clinician interviews revealed a 52-fold increase in the likelihood of current suicidal ideation across the range of the Computerized Adaptive Test Suicide Scale (CAT-SS). CONCLUSIONS: The CAT-SS is able to accurately measure the latent suicide dimension with a mean of 10 items in approximately 2 ...

AB  - The original publication is available at www.springerlink.com Copyright Springer [Full text of this article is not available in the UHRA] ; In a computer-adaptive test (CAT), learners are not usually allowed to revise previously entered responses. In this paper, we present findings from our most recent empirical study, which involved two groups of learners and a modified version of a CAT application that provided the facility to revise previously entered responses. Findings from this study showed that the ability to modify previously entered responses did not lead to significant differences in performance for one group of learners (p>0.05), and only relatively small yet significant differences for the other (p<0.01). The implications and the reasons for the difference between the groups are explored in this paper. Despite the small effect of the modification, it is argued that this option is likely to lead to a reduction in student anxiety and an increase in student confidence in this assessment method. ; Peer reviewed

AB  - The transonic facility of DLR G<c3><b6>ttingen (TWG) has been modernised with respect to an improved flow quality and flow simulation, as well as to the logistics of exchangeable test sections, operational reliability and productivity. It is presently equipped with a Laval nozzle for supersonic flow measurements, a perforated test section (6% open, 60 degree slanted holes) for transonic measurements, and a two-dimensional adaptive test section for subsonic measurements. The latter can perform two-dimensinal adaptive tests on wing profiles, using the Cauchy integral formula for wall adaptation, as well as two-dimensional wall adaptation for three-dimensional models, utilising the Wedemeyer/Lamarche procedure, also known as the VKI method. For both cases, it is shown that the wall adaptation was successful. The 3D force results compare quite well to test results from the perforated test section, as well as to nominally interference-free results. The pressure distribution from the wing profile tests compare quite well to theoretical calculations. In the course of windtunnel modernisation, the transonic facility of DLR Goettingen has been equipped with the new software system DeAsfor data acquisition and control of experimental facilities. In this environment the wall adaptation programs had to be implemented. Before adjusting the computed wall shape, it has to be controlled in the loop for sufficient accuracy and tolerable bending stresses. A simplified finite element method - also taking into account the pressure loads at the wall - is used for this purpose. The simplified approach has been checked against more detailed computations using ANSYS and NASTRAN.

CY  - NA
AB  - Computer administered tests are becoming increasingly prevalent as computer technology becomes more readily available on a large scale. For testing programs that utilize both computer and paper administrations, mode effects are problematic in that they can result in examinee scores that are artificially inflated or deflated. As such, researchers have engaged in extensive studies of whether scores differ across paper and computer presentations of the same tests. The research generally seems to indicate that the more complicated it is to present or take a test on computer, the greater the possibility of mode effects. In a computer adaptive test, mode effects may be a particular concern if items are calibrated using item responses obtained from one administration mode (i.e., paper), and those parameters are then used operationally in a different administration mode (i.e., computer). This paper studies the suitability of using parameters calibrated from a paper administration for item selection and scoring in a computer adaptive administration, for two tests with lengthy passages that required navigation in the computer administration. The results showed that the use of paper calibrated parameters versus computer calibrated parameters in computer adaptive administrations had small to moderate effects on the reliability of examinee scores, at fairly short test lengths. This effect was generally diminished for longer test lengths. However, the results suggest that in some cases, some loss in reliability might be inevitable if paper-calibrated parameters are used in computer adaptive administrations.

CY  - NA
AB  - To efficiently obtain information about both the general abilities and detailed cognitive profiles of examinees from a single model that uses a single-calibration process, higher-order cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) that employ higher-order cognitive diagnostic models have been developed. However, the current item selection methods used in higher-order CD-CAT adaptively select items according to only the attribute profiles, which might lead to low precision regarding general abilities; hence, an appropriate method was proposed for this CAT system in this study. Under the framework of the higher-order models, the responses were affected by attribute profiles, which were governed by general abilities. It is reasonable to hold that the item responses were affected by a combination of general abilities and attribute profiles. Based on the logic of Shannon entropy and the generalized deterministic, inputs, noisy â€œandâ€ gate (G-DINA) model discrimination index (GDI), two new item selection methods were proposed for higher-order CD-CAT by considering the above combination in this study. The simulation results demonstrated that the new methods achieved more accurate estimations of both general abilities and cognitive profiles than the existing methods and maintained distinct advantages in terms of item pool usage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes > .90). The P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may be a viable and efficient assessment method.

AB  - International audience ; BACKGROUND:Several Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) have been proposed to facilitate assessments in mental health. These tests are built in a standard way, disregarding useful and usually available information not included in the assessment scales that could increase the precision and utility of CATs, such as the history of suicide attempts.METHODS:Using the items of a previously developed scale for suicidal risk, we compared the performance of a standard CAT and a decision tree in a support decision system to identify suicidal behavior. We included the history of past suicide attempts as a class for the separation of patients in the decision tree.RESULTS:The decision tree needed an average of four items to achieve a similar accuracy than a standard CAT with nine items. The accuracy of the decision tree, obtained after 25 cross-validations, was 81.4%. A shortened test adapted for the separation of suicidal and non-suicidal patients was developed.CONCLUSION:CATs can be very useful tools for the assessment of suicidal risk. However, standard CATs do not use all the information that is available. A decision tree can improve the precision of the assessment since they are constructed using a priori information.

AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well.

AB  - We used the Dutch-Flemish version of the USA PROMIS adult V1.0 item bank for Anxiety as input for developing a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure the entire latent anxiety continuum. First, psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample (N = 2,010) showed that the 29-item bank has psychometric properties that are required for a CAT administration. Second, a post hoc CAT simulation showed efficient and highly precise measurement, with an average number of 8.64 items for the clinical sample, and 9.48 items for the general population sample. Furthermore, the accuracy of our CAT version was highly similar to that of the full item bank administration, both in final score estimates and in distinguishing clinical subjects from persons without a mental health disorder. We discuss the future directions and limitations of CAT development with the Dutch-Flemish version of the PROMIS Anxiety item bank. ; Stress-related psychiatric disorders across the life span

TI  - Developing and Validating a Computerized Adaptive Test to Measure Broad and Specific Factors of Internalizing in a Community Sample
JO  - NA

PY  - 2017
PB  - SAGE Publications
CY  - NA
AB  - Highly efficient assessments that better account for comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders (internalizing) are required to identify individuals who are most at risk of psychopathology in the community. The current study examined the efficiency and validity associated with a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure broad and specific levels of internalizing psychopathology. The sample comprised 3,175 respondents to an online survey. Items from five banks (generalized anxiety, depression, obsessive<e2><80><93>compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder) were jointly calibrated using a bifactor item response theory model. Simulations indicated that an adaptive algorithm could accurately ( rs <e2><89><a5> 0.90) estimate general internalizing and specific disorder scores using on average 44 items in comparison with the full 133-item bank (67% reduction in items). Scores on the CAT demonstrate convergent and divergent validity with previously validated short severity scales and could significantly differentiate cases of DSM-5 disorder. As such, the CAT validly measures both broad and specific constructs of internalizing disorders in a manner similar to the full item bank and a static brief form but with greater gains in efficiency and, therefore, a reduced degree of respondent burden.

AB  - Importance: The most frequently used measures of facial emotion recognition (FER) are insufficiently comprehensive, reliable, valid, and efficient; moreover, the impact of gender on scoring has not been controlled. Objective: To develop a computerized adaptive test of FER for adults with schizophrenia. Design: First, we selected photographs from a published database. Second, items that fitted well to a Rasch model were used to form the item bank. Third and last, we determined the best administration mode for prospective users to achieve both high reliability and efficiency. Setting: Psychiatric hospitals and the community. Participants: Adults living with schizophrenia (n = 351) and adults without diagnosed mental illness (n = 101). Results: After removal of misfit items (infit or outfit <e2><89><a5>1.4), the remaining 165 items were selected to form an item bank. Among them, 39 showed severe gender bias, so the item difficulties were adjusted accordingly. On the basis of the item bank, two administration modes were recommended for prospective users. The reliable mode required approximately 128 items (nearly 20 min) to achieve reliability (.72-.81), similar to that of the entire item bank. The efficient mode required approximately 73 items (approximate 11 min) to provide acceptable reliability (.69-.73) for the seven domain scores. Conclusions and relevance: Our newly developed measure provides comprehensive, valid, and unbiased (to examinees' gender) assessments of FER in adults living with schizophrenia. In addition, the administration modes can be flexibly changed to optimize the reliability or efficiency for prospective users. What this article adds: This newly developed FER measure can help occupational therapists identify deficits in recognizing specific basic emotions and plan corresponding interventions to manage the impact on their clients' social functions.

CY  - NA
AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing a high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adatpive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators' responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback by solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Follow-up of stroke survivors is important to objectify activity limitations and/or participations restrictions. Responsive measurement tools are needed with a low burden for professional and patient. AIM: To examine the concurrent validity, floor and ceiling effects and responsiveness of both domains of the Late-Life Function and Disability Index Computerized Adaptive Test (LLFDI-CAT) in first-ever stroke survivors discharged to their home setting. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Community. POPULATION: First ever stroke survivors. METHODS: Participants were visited within three weeks after discharge and six months later. Stroke Impact Scale (SIS 3.0) and Five-Meter Walk Test (5MWT) outcomes were used to investigate concurrent validity of both domains, activity limitations, and participation restriction, of the LLFDI-CAT. Scores at three weeks and six months were used to examine floor and ceiling effects and change scores were used for responsiveness. Responsiveness was assessed using predefined hypotheses. Hypotheses regarding the correlations with change scores of related measures, unrelated measures, and differences between groups were formulated. RESULTS: The study included 105 participants. Concurrent validity (R) of the LLFDI-CAT activity limitations domain compared with the physical function domain of the SIS 3.0 and with the 5MWT was 0.79 and -0.46 respectively. R of the LLFDI-CAT participation restriction domain compared with the participation domain of the S1S 3.0 and with the 5MWT was 0.79 and -0.41 respectively. A ceiling effect (15%) for the participation restriction domain was found at six months. Both domains, activity limitations and participation restrictions, of the LLFDI-CAT, scored well on responsiveness: 100% (12/12) and 91% ( I 2/11) respectively of the predefined hypotheses were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The LLFDI-CAT seems to be a valid instrument and both domains are able to detect change over time. Therefore, the LLFD-CAT is a promising tool to use both in practice and in ...

Policy makers, teachers, school managers, parents and students have been called to the reinvent their way of <e2><80><98>doing school<e2><80><99>. At the same time, the governance of the education system and schools<e2><80><99> organizations have been exposed to unprecedented tensions. The pandemic emergency has been a lens revealing intersections and structural tensions among various level and actors of the education system, but also allowing opportunities of changes thanks to the exogenous shock. At the same time, it must be considered that the emergency is interacting on pre-existing inequalities and contradictions. Higher education systems have been affected too: in constant evolution due to constant transformations of society and changed functions of knowledge, universities have undergone a structural change along with pandemic times. Simultaneously, the growing relevance of knowledge for the economic development of the capitalistic system has profoundly affected higher education systems, characterized by the neo-liberal approach which his subject of increasing critical analysis. ; In this paper we present results on the estimation of mathematics skills of Italian grade 10 students with special educational needs. The estimation was carried out by means of a com-puter based multilevel adaptive test 1 - 3 - 3 (MST) constructed within the framework of a doctoral research in Social, Developmental and Educational Research Psychology. An item bank was used to construct the MST test. Verification of the unidimensionality of the bank was done through exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and analysis of model fit indices with Rasch's model (Rasch, 1960) being calibrated. Verification of the best measurement properties of the test compared to a linear test was performed by comparing information functions. It is shown that this type of test is able to provide estimates of the ability of students with a con-siderable level of ...

AB  - BackgroundWith the increasingly rapid growth of the elderly population, individuals aged 65years and above now compose 14% of Taiwanese citizens, thereby making Taiwanese society an aged society. A leading factor that affects the elderly population is dementia. A method of precisely and efficiently examining patients with dementia through multidimensional computer adaptive testing (MCAT) to accurately determine the patients' stage of dementia needs to be developed. This study aimed to develop online MCAT that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, or smartphones to predict the extent of dementia for patients responding to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) instrument.MethodsThe CDR was applied to 366 outpatients in a hospital in Taiwan. MCAT was employed with parameters for items across eight dimensions, and responses were simulated to compare the efficiency and precision between MCAT and non-adaptive testing (NAT). The number of items saved and the estimated person measures was compared between the results of MCAT and NAT, respectively.ResultsMCAT yielded substantially more precise measurements and was considerably more efficient than NAT. MCAT achieved 20.19% (=[53-42.3]/53) saving in item length when the measurement differences were less than 5%. Pearson correlation coefficients were highly consistent among the eight domains. The cut-off points for the overall measures were -1.4, -0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 logits, which was equivalent to 20% for each portion in percentile scores. Substantially fewer items were answered through MCAT than through NAT without compromising the precision of MCAT.ConclusionsDeveloping a website that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, and smartphones to help them perform online screening and prediction of dementia in older adults is useful and manageable.

AB  - Emotion knowledge in children includes emotion recognition in other peoples' faces, as well as understanding the internal and external causes and consequences of emotions and strategies for regulating them. To date, there is no measure in the German-speaking countries that captures emotion knowledge in a differentiated but also reliable and valid way. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM) aims to close this gap. The ATEM follows an adaptive design and six components of emotion knowledge. The 32 Rasch-scaled items are embedded in an attractive story and vary in their difficulty within and between the components. In a sample of 581 3 - 9-year-olds, the test showed a good fit to a six-dimensional model and very good psychometric properties. In a subsample of 254 3 - 5-year-olds, correlations between the ATEM and a measure of emotion knowledge and measures of expressive and receptive language abilities demonstrated good validity. The ATEM proved to be a good measure of emotion knowledge in children. ; Das Emotionswissen von Kindern umfasst neben dem Ablesen von Emotionen aus Gesichtern anderer Menschen auch das Erkennen von externalen und internalen Ursachen von Emotionen sowie das Wissen <c3><bc>ber ihre Konsequenzen und Regulationsm<c3><b6>glichkeiten. Im deutschsprachigen Raum gibt es bisher kein Testverfahren, welches das Emotionswissen auf diese Weise differenziert und gleichzeitig reliabel und valide erfasst. Mit dem Adaptiven Test des Emotionswissens (ATEM) wird diese L<c3><bc>cke geschlossen. Der ATEM fragt in einem adaptiven Design 6 Teilaspekte des Emotionswissens ab, wobei die 32 Items in eine kinderfreundliche Geschichte eingebettet sind. Der nach der Item-Response-Theorie aufgebaute Test zeigt mit einer Gesamtstichprobe von N = 581 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 9 Jahren gute psychometrische Eigenschaften. In einer Substichprobe von n = 254 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 5 Jahren wurde der ATEM anhand von Korrelationen mit verschiedenen Variablen validiert. Insgesamt eignet sich der ATEM gut zur differenzierten Messung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms etal., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial ( |.30|) correlations. The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested.

AB  - Objectives Measure quality of life (QoL) outcomes using a novel computerised adaptive test in a clinical setting, and determine the social and demographic factors associated with specific QoL domains in patients with glaucoma. Design Cross-sectional study between July 2020 and April 2021. Participants English-speaking adults presenting to glaucoma clinic. Patients with cognitive impairment on a six-item cognitive impairment screen or with intraocular surgery within 90 days prior to presentation were excluded. Results Of 206 patients surveyed, mean age was 64.8 years (SD 15.2), 122 (56.7%) were female and 159 (74.7%) were white. On multivariable regression, visual acuity was associated with greater activity limitation (<ce><b2>=<e2><88><92>2.8 points, 95% CI <e2><88><92>3.8 to <e2><80><93>1.8, p&lt;0.001) and worse mobility (<ce><b2>=<e2><88><92>2.1 points, 95% CI <e2><88><92>3.2 to <e2><80><93>0.9, p&lt;0.001), while poorer visual field (VF) mean deviation was associated with lower scores on the emotional well-being domain (<ce><b2>=<e2><88><92>2.4 points, 95% CI <e2><88><92>4.6 to <e2><80><93>0.3, p=0.03). Glaucoma suspects and those with early VF defects had higher QoL scores than those with severe glaucoma in the following domains: activity limitation (88.5<c2><b1>14.6 vs 74.3<c2><b1>21.9, respectively, p&lt;0.001), mobility (91.0<c2><b1>12.5 vs 80.0<c2><b1>25.3, respectively, p=0.005) and concerns domains (82.2<c2><b1>13.9 vs 72.5 5<c2><b1>18.9, respectively, p=0.01). Conclusions In a busy glaucoma clinic where QoL was measured with online adaptive tests for glaucoma, we found that several demographic and clinical variables are associated with lower domain scores, suggesting that patients with predisposing demographic and clinical factors are at a higher risk of worse QoL.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The assessment of recovery from burn injury is critical to improving pediatric health. However, there is a lack of brief, burn-specific measures to assess preschool-aged burn survivors<e2><80><99> health outcomes. We developed items pools for a new, parent-reported computer adaptive test based assessment of preschool-aged children<e2><80><99>s burn outcomes. Methods Initial item pools were informed by the Preschool LIBRE Conceptual Model based on the International Classification for Children (ICF) and the Burn Outcomes Questionnaires (BOQ 0<e2><80><93>5) and generated from a review of existing instruments assessing health and developmental outcomes in children 1<e2><80><93>5 years. Candidate items underwent a review process to bin items together based on the underlying construct they assessed. Items were then winnowed down and further refined based on clinical expert consensus meetings. The winnowing process focused on ensuring items assessed abilities and behaviors that could be reliably determined by parent report, were age-relevant, and focused on health and developmental concepts that are important in the assessment of children<e2><80><99>s burn recovery. To ensure item quality, we conducted parent cognitive interviews. In final reviews, we standardized item recall periods, response options, verb tense, and literacy demands. Results A total of 9,509 items were identified and extracted. Four item pool domains were established: communication and language development (42 items), physical functioning (53 items), psychological functioning (56 items), and social functioning (37 items). The respective item pools aim to assess: children<e2><80><99>s ability to receive meaning and produce language; children<e2><80><99>s gross and fine motor abilities; children<e2><80><99>s emotions and behavior (internalizing and externalizing behaviors, dysregulation, toileting, response to trauma and resilience); and children<e2><80><99>s social participation and abilities. Recall period and response options were refined for consistency for all 188 final items. Conclusions Four item pools were developed assessing four domains 1) communication and language development, 2) physical functioning, 3) psychological functioning and 4) social functioning for preschool-aged children. The item pools are currently being field-tested for the calibration and validation of the Preschool LIBRE CAT Profile. Applicability of Research to Practice This work is relevant to researchers and practitioners evaluating the effects of burn injury on preschool-aged children<e2><80><99>s health and developmental outcomes.

AB  - Public Significance Statement This study suggests that PROMIS CATs for Depression and Anxiety measure the same constructs as matching BSI subscales in Dutch adult patients treated for common mental disorders, are at least as able to detect change over time, and categorize the change scores of more patients as actually changed. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients.We evaluated construct validity, responsiveness, and utility of change indicators of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS adult v1.0 item banks for Depression and Anxiety administered as computerized adaptive test (CAT). Specifically, the CATs were compared to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) using pre- and re-test data of adult patients treated for common mental disorders (N = 400; median pre-to-re-test interval = 215 days). Construct validity was evaluated with Pearson's correlations and Cohen's ds; responsiveness with Pearson's correlations and pre-post effect sizes (ES); utility of change indicators with kappa coefficients and percentages of (dis)agreement. The results showed that the PROMIS CATs measure similar constructs as matching BSI scales. Under the assumption of measuring similar constructs, the CAT and BSI Depression scales were similarly responsive. For the Anxiety scales, we found a higher responsiveness for CAT (ES = 0.64) compared to the BSI (ES = 0.50). Finally, both CATs categorized the change scores of more patients as changed compared to matching BSI scales, indicating that the PROMIS CATs may be more able to detect actual change than the BSI. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement over matching BSI scales as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients. We discuss several additional differences between the PROMIS CATs and the BSI to help test users choose instruments. These differences include the adopted measurement theory (Item Response Theory vs. Classical Test Theory), the mode of administration (CAT vs. fixed items), and the area of application (universal vs. predominantly clinical). ; Stress-related psychiatric disorders across the life span

AB  - text ; Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners<e2><80><99> speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper<e2><80><93>and<e2><80><93>pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real<e2><80><93>time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two<e2><80><93>parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test<e2><80><93>takers<e2><80><99> severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20<e2><80><93>item simulated fixed<e2><80><93>length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test. The computerized adaptive test to assess severity levels of English speaking anxiety proved consistent with the psychometric evidence that suggests that it is feasible to score a single index from the newly constructed anxiety inventory using IRT methods and that this single index score can be compared on common metrics across all items in the item pool. Thus, assessment of speaking anxiety based on CAT may contribute to designing syllabus by establishing an individualized teaching. ; Curriculum and Instruction

AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

AB  - Although the functionalist perspective on emotional development posits that emotions serve adaptive functions, empirical tests of the role of anger mostly focus on how anger contributes to dysfunction. Developmentally, as children gain agency and skill at emotion regulation between the ages of 36 months and 48 months, their modulation of anger may facilitate its functional role for behavior. We examined this possibility through study of how 120 children's anger and sadness were related to persistence during the transparent locked box task at ages 36 and 48 months. Using survival analyses, we examined how children's anger and sadness were related to their giving up during the challenging task, and whether those relations were moderated by age. Using hidden Markov models (HMMs), we examined how children transitioned among anger, sadness, and on-task behavior states and whether those dynamics differed with age. Survival analysis revealed that age moderated the relation between anger and giving up. Greater anger was associated with greater likelihood of giving up earlier in the task at 36 months but with lower likelihood of giving up at 48 months. HMM analyses revealed that children were more likely to transition from a Calm/On-task to Calm/Off-task state at 36 months than at 48 months; that children were more likely to remain in an Anger/On-task state at 36 months than at 48 months; and that children were more likely to transition from Calm/On-task to Anger/On-task, and from Anger/On-task back to Calm/On-task at 48 months than at 36 months. Taken together, the findings suggest that anger appraisals may facilitate children in maintaining persistence, but that this functionality may develop with age.

AB  - The present study investigated the implications of computer-adaptive testing (operationalized by way of multistage adaptive testing; MAT) and "conventional" fixed order computer testing for various test-relevant outcomes in numeracy, including achievement, test-relevant motivation and engagement, and subjective test experience. It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students' test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students' test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

AB  - Studies have shown that test anxiety has become more prevalent since the adoption of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 and that test anxiety negatively affects student achievement. Early research viewed test anxiety as being a unidimensional construct; however, recent research has purported that test anxiety is a multidimensional construct. Consequently, test anxiety being viewed as multidimensional has changed how test anxiety is measured as evidenced by the development of multidimensional test anxiety measurement scales. Literature indicates that there is a gap in the study of K-12 test anxiety and response time data on assessments. A nonexperimental correlational research design was used for this study. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between multidimensional test anxiety measures and the response time of students taking a computerized adaptive math assessment, the "Measures of Academic Progress"<c2><ae> (MAP<c2><ae>) by the Northwest Evaluation Association<e2><84><a2> (NWEA<e2><84><a2>), while controlling for gender. Participants for the study were 215 seventh grade math students at a school in the West. The test anxiety of participants was measured using the Children's Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS). The response time data was captured by the NWEA<e2><84><a2> MAP<c2><ae> math tests. Spearman correlations were used to examine the relationship between test anxiety and response time. No statistically significant relationships were found. Recommendations for future research are to examine relationships between test anxiety and RTE using different normative thresholds (NT) and utilizing other multidimensional test anxiety scales as they become commercially available.

AB  - Technology-Enhanced Items (TEIs) have been purported to be more motivating and engaging to test takers than traditional multiple-choice items. The claim of enhanced engagement, however, has thus far received limited research attention. This study examined the rates of rapid-guessing behavior received by three types of items (multiple-choice, multiple select, and TEIs) on a commonly-used K-12 adaptive achievement test. Across three subject areas, the TEIs consistently showed the lowest rapid guessing rate, suggesting that their use may help mitigate the problem of disengaged test taking.

PY  - NA
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the "SE" is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the "SE" threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the "SE" stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a universal social skills program, the Social Skills Improvement System Classwide Intervention Program (SSIS-CIP; Elliott & Gresham, 2007), for students in first grade. Classrooms from 6 elementary schools were randomly assigned to treatment or business-as-usual control conditions. Teachers assigned to the treatment condition implemented the SSIS-CIP over a 12-week period. Students' social skills, problem behaviors, and approaches to learning were assessed via teacher ratings and direct observations of classroom behavior. In addition, their early literacy and numeracy skills were measured via computer-adaptive standardized tests. SSIS-CIP participation yielded small positive effects in students' social skills (particularly empathy and social engagement) and approaches to learning (academic motivation and engagement). Students' problem behaviors and academic skills, however, were unaffected by SSIS-CIP exposure.

AB  - Scholarship regarding adolescent resilience has typically defined resilience as the absence of negative outcomes rather than the existence of positive outcomes. This study drew on the challenge model of resilience, which anticipates a curvilinear relationship between stress exposure and adaptive functioning, to test whether adolescents reporting moderate levels of stress exposure were more likely to evidence prosocial behavior than youth exposed to more or less stress. Using data from approximately 13,000 adolescents, we tested three analytic models and investigated hypothesized moderation by coping, social resources, and markers of adolescent status. Our results did not align with the challenge model. Instead, we found that stress exposure was differentially associated with measures of prosocial behavior, that social resources supported volunteering but impeded helping a peer in some instances, and that markers of historically marginalized status were more predictive of stopping peer harassment than volunteering. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of CATSIB (Computer Adaptive Testing-Simultaneous Item Bias Test) for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) when items in the matching and studied subtest are administered adaptively in the context of a realistic multi-stage adaptive test (MST). MST was simulated using a 4-item module in a 7-panel administration. Three independent variables, expected to affect DIF detection rates, were manipulated: item difficulty, sample size, and balanced/unbalanced design. CATSIB met the acceptable criteria, meaning that the Type I error and power rates met 5% and 80%, respectively, for the large reference/moderate focal sample and the large reference/large focal sample conditions. These results indicate that CATSIB can be used to consistently and accurately detect DIF on an MST, but only with moderate to large samples. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

JO  - ProQuest LLC

PY  - NA
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - Current CAT applications consist of predominantly dichotomous items, and CATs with polytomously scored items are limited. To ascertain the best approach to polytomous CAT, a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection, ability estimation, and impact of termination rules based on polytomous IRT models. Few studies investigated the optimal pool characteristics for polytomous CAT implementation. Using the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) (Muraki, 1992), this study aims to identify an optimal item pool design for tests with polytomous items by extending the p-optimality method (Reckase, 2007). The extension includes the definition of atheta-bin to describe polytomous items succinctly for pool design, and item generation strategy using constrained nonlinear optimization method. Optimal item pools are generated using CAT simulations with and without practical constraints. The item pool characteristics under each condition are summarized and their performance is evaluated against an extended operational item pool. The results indicated that the practical constraints of the a-stratified exposure control and content balancing do not affect pool size to a large extent. However, the a-stratified control affects the pool characteristics greatly: the items included in the simulated pools with the control have larger a-parameter and provide higher maximum information on average. On the other hand, the content balancing applied in this study has little impact on pool design. The evaluation results of the pool performance are closely related to the pool characteristics. When the a-stratified exposure control applied, the consistent results include: 1) the average test information is lower than that without the constraint; 2) RMSE is higher and the correlation between the true and estimated abilities is lower; 3) the percentage of the correct classification for the highest achievement level is lower. However, for all the simulated optimal pools, while the test information is consistently above the target level 10.0, it is concluded that the a-stratified method resulted in an efficient use of less discriminative items with small decreases in measurement precision. With regard to the item pool usage, the percentage of items that are fully used, well used, rarely used, and never used are quite comparable for the pools designed with constraints. However, compared with the extended operational pool, when the a-stratified method applied, the conditional test overlap rate of the simulated pools is consistently lower. For the pool blueprint, because the normal ability distribution is assumed, more items are included in the middle of the ability scale for all simulated optimal pools. The distributions of the a- and b- parameters are similar under all conditions. When the a-stratified method applied, there are fewer items in the first stratum and the number of items in the second and third stratum is nearly identical. In addition, with the content balancing control, the number of items in the first content area is slightly less than the second one.

AB  - Measuring the implementation fidelity (IF) or integrity of interventions is crucial, otherwise a positive or negative outcome cannot be interpreted. Direct and indirect methods of IF measurement tend to over-emphasize teacher behaviour. This paper focuses on IF measured by student behaviour collected through computers. Attainment was measured by the STAR test of maths (a computerized item-banked adaptive norm-referenced test). Implementation quality (IF) was measured by Accelerated Maths (AM) (an instruction-free personalized practice and progress-monitoring system in mastery of mathematics skills). Attainment data was gathered in the UK on 20,103 students in 148 schools, and of these implementation data on n =<c2><a0>6,285. Only a small percentage of pupils scored on five AM implementation indices at or above the levels recommended. Correlations between attainment and implementation indices were modest, but high implementation was positively correlated with high attainment. Socio-economic status did not appear to affect implementation or attainment. Implementation quality of AM is clearly a problem in the UK, and needs improvement. However, overall students still scored above average on attainment.

AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Background of the study: Leadership is needed when one must deal with education management which means the relationship of influence between the leader and followers who have the same goal, to make a change. It can be used as a guideline in the planning and creating evaluation criteria to improve the adaptive leadership of teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which consistent with the theory and the research result as well as the vision from scholars and organization. Objective: The objectives of this research were to (a) develop a theoretical model of structural relationship of major components, minor components and indicators of adaptive leadership, (b) test the fitness of the model was developed from theoretical model and empirical data, and (c) verify the factor loading value of the major components, minor components and indicators. Materials and Methods: The descriptive research collected by using the 5-level rating scale questionnaire. The population consisted of 1,740 teachers in Boromarajonani college of nursing under Boromarajchanok Institute. The data analysis using AMOS statistical program was done with the 617-return questionnaire. Results: The results showed that the theoretical model was consistent with empirical data with the following statistical metrics: relative Chi-square (CMIN/DF) < 3.00, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.05, goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and normed fit index (NFI) 0.90-1.00 were in accordance with the criteria from both the first and second order of confirmative factor analysis. The major components had factor loading ranging from 0.71 to 1.00, which is higher than the criterion as 0.70. The minor components and indicators had factor loading are higher than the criterion as 0.30. Conclusion: The finding can be used as a guideline in the planning and creation of evaluation criteria to improve the adaptive leadership of teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which is consistent with the theory and research results as well as the vision from scholars and organization. This will help improve the performance efficiency of the teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which will affect the education management and education improvement.

AB  - The interactionist model (IM) of human development (R. D. Conger & M. B. Donellan, 2007) proposes that the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and human development involves a dynamic interplay that includes both social causation (SES influences human development) and social selection (individual characteristics affect SES). Using a multigenerational data set involving 271 families, the current study finds empirical support for the IM. Adolescent personality characteristics indicative of social competence, goal-setting, hard work, and emotional stability predicted later SES, parenting, and family characteristics that were related to the positive development of a third-generation child. Processes of both social selection and social causation appear to account for the association between SES and dimensions of human development indicative of healthy functioning across multiple generations.

AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) assumes that state-mandated tests provide useful information to school administrators and teachers. However, interviews with administrators and teachers suggest that Minnesota's tests, which are representative of the current generation of state-mandated tests, fail to provide useful information to administrators and teachers about areas that need attention. The use of a single level of difficulty causes harmful stress and provides measurements of poor quality for many students. Computer-adaptive tests are a practical alternative, provide more useful information, reduce stress among students, and address four major concerns that teachers have about testing. This alternative could strengthen the link between testing and improved educational outcomes and improve the chances that NCLB will have a positive impact. However, current federal policy prohibits the use of computer-adaptive tests for accountability purposes. This article provides specific recommendations that potentially could address four critical concerns about current state-mandated tests. (Contains 1 figure, 1 table, and 6 notes.)

TI  - A Comparison of Anchor-Item Designs for the Concurrent Calibration of Large Banks of Likert-Type Items

AB  - Current interest in measuring quality of life is generating interest in the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) with Likert-type items. Calibration of an item bank for use in CAT requires collecting responses to a large number of candidate items. However, the number is usually too large to administer to each subject in the calibration sample. The concurrent anchor-item design solves this problem by splitting the items into separate subtests, with some common items across subtests; then administering each subtest to a different sample; and finally running estimation algorithms once on the aggregated data array, from which a substantial number of responses are then missing. Although the use of anchor-item designs is widespread, the consequences of several configuration decisions on the accuracy of parameter estimates have never been studied in the polytomous case. The present study addresses this question by simulation, comparing the outcomes of several alternatives on the configuration of the anchor-item design. The factors defining variants of the anchor-item design are (a) subtest size, (b) balance of common and unique items per subtest, (c) characteristics of the common items, and (d) criteria for the distribution of unique items across subtests. The results of this study indicate that maximizing accuracy in item parameter recovery requires subtests of the largest possible number of items and the smallest possible number of common items; the characteristics of the common items and the criterion for distribution of unique items do not affect accuracy.

AB  - The study evaluates an easily-administered test-anxiety reduction program. An entire fifth grade was screened, and 36 students identified as test-anxious were randomly assigned to an Intervention or a non-participant Control group. The intervention was an accelerated desensitization and adaptive attitudes (ADAA) treatment which involved stretch-tense, deep breath, release-relax and positive suggestion sequences to expedite anxiety reduction and also positive adaptive associations to each of eight learning, review, and testing scenes. The intervention was presented via a 31 minute recording, which students reviewed in five separate sessions over about half the school year. Test gains were calculated from the 2005 Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment tests (TCAPs) given after the intervention, adjusted for individual student 2004 TCAPs before the intervention. The Intervention group attained a significant seven percentile test gain over the Controls. The use of the recorded intervention is seen to vastly reduce the number of professional hours required for an anxiety-reduction program, and the program shows promise as a highly cost-effective means to benefit test-anxious students.

AB  - The 7th International Conference on Education Data Mining held on July 4th-7th, 2014, at the Institute of Education, London, UK is the leading international forum for high-quality research that mines large data sets in order to answer educational research questions that shed light on the learning process. These data sets may come from the traces that students leave when they interact, either individually or collaboratively, with learning management systems, interactive learning environments, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games or when they participate in a data-rich learning context. The types of data therefore range from raw log files to eyetracking devices and other sensor data. Being hosted in London, UK the theme of the conference is "Big Data--Big Ben--Education Data Mining for Big Impact in Teaching and Learning". In this seventh year of EDM conferences, it is clear that the field is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. With renewed focus on education driven by big data learning analytics has put the EDM field in the center of growing interest. Traditional educational technologies, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and learning management systems all continue to generate growing amounts of data that are becoming available for analysis. The new interest in MOOCs and their promise to reach thousands or even hundreds of thousands of students per class requires techniques for feedback and grading that are being researched in the EDM domain. The conference submissions this year also continue to grow.

AB  - The effects of providing immediate knowledge of results (KR) and adaptive testing on test anxiety and test-taking motivation were investigated. Also studied was the accuracy of student perceptions of the difficulty of adaptive and conventional tests administered with or without immediate knowledge of results. Testees were 350 college students divided into high- and low-ability groups and randomly assigned to one of four test strategies by KR conditions. The ability level of examinees was found to be related to their reported levels of motivation and to differences in reported motivation under the different testing conditions. These results suggest that adaptive testing creates a psychological environment for testing which is more equivalently motivating for examinees of all ability levels and results in a greater standardization of the test-taking environment, than does conventional testing.

AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

AB  - According to item response theory (IRT), examinee ability estimation is independent of the particular set of test items administered from a calibrated pool. Although the most popular application of this feature of IRT is computerized adaptive (CA) testing, a recently proposed alternative is self-adapted (SA) testing, in which examinees choose the difficulty level of each of their test items. Examinee performance was compared under CA and SA testing conditions for college students from an introductory statistics course. Three test forms were developed, testing mathematical knowledge necessary for the course. The final pool contained 93 items which were administered to 204 subjects. The SA test yielded significantly higher ability scores, and examinees taking the SA test reported significantly lower posttest state anxiety. Implications of the differences between the two test types for measurement practice are discussed. Three tables present study data. (Author/SLD)

AB  - Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) make it possible to estimate the ability of each student during the testing process. The computer presents items to students at the appropriate level, and students take different versions of the same test. Computerized testing increases the flexibility of test management in that: (1) tests are given on demand and scores are immediately available; (2) differences among administrators cannot affect scores and trained administrators are not needed; (3) tests can be individually paced; and (4) test security is increased. Computerized testing also offers options for timing and formatting, increases efficiency, and can provide accurate scores over a wide range of abilities. Some limitations to CATs are considered. CATs are not appropriate for some subjects and skills. Hardware limitations restrict the types of items that can be administered by computer, and many schools simply do not have the resources to administer CATs. A relatively large sample is needed to norm test items; comparable scores depend heavily on the quality of the estimates of item characteristics because each student answers a different set of items. The military has been among the pioneers in using CATs and at least two public school systems have begun to use them. A list of six organizations involved in computerized adaptive testing is included. (SLD)

AB  - The equivalence of pencil and paper Rasch item calibrations when used in a computer adaptive test administration was explored in this study. Items (n=726) were precalibarted with the pencil and paper test administrations. A computer adaptive test was administered to 321 medical technology students using the pencil and paper precalibrations in the item selection algorithms and in the computation of examinee ability estimates. The response data from the computer adaptive test administration were analyzed yielding recalibrated item difficulties and examinee ability estimates. Item precalibrations were compared with item recalibrations. Examinee ability estimates obtained using the item precalibrations on the computer adaptive administration were compared with the examinee ability estimates obtained from using the item recalibrations on the computer adaptive administration. The correlation for examinee ability estimates was 0.99 and for item correlations it was 0.90. Some item calibrations shifted but most remained consistent within the limits of error. Item shift, however, did not affect the ordering of examinee ability estimates. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 23 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - A new testing strategy that provides protection against the problem of having examinees in adaptive testing choose difficulty levels that are not matched to their proficiency levels was introduced and evaluated. The method, termed restricted self-adapted testing (RSAT), still provides examinees with a degree of control over the difficulty levels of their test items. The range of item choice is restricted to a region around the examinee's current proficiency estimate. Participants in this study were 186 students in grades 3 through 8 in the Portland (Oregon) Public School system during the winter of 1992-93, who were tested as part of an ongoing computerized adaptive testing program. Students were randomly assigned to a computerized adaptive test (CAT), a self-adaptive test (SADT), or RSAT in mathematics. Results indicate no differences between CAT and SADT conditions in terms of mean proficiency and mean posttest state anxiety. The basic RSAT method appears to hold promise for providing examinees with control over the testing situation, while preventing large mismatches between item difficulty choice and proficiency level. The RSAT procedure should be evaluated empirically. (SLD)

AB  - This report examines how selection fairness is influenced by the characteristics of a selection instrument in terms of its distribution of item difficulties, level of item discrimination, degree of item bias, and testing strategy. Computer simulation was used in the administration of either a conventional or Bayesian adaptive ability test to a hypothetical target population consisting of a minority and majority subgroup. Fairness was evaluated by three indices which reflect the degree of differential validity, errors in prediction (Cleary's model), and proportion of applicants exceeding a selection cutoff (Thorndike's model). Major findings are: (1) when used in conjunction with either the Bayesian or conventional test, differential prediction increased fairness and facilitated the interpretation of the fairness indices; (2) the Bayesian adaptive tests were consistently fairer than the conventional tests for all item pools above the alpha=.7 discrimination level for tests of more than 30 items; (3) the differential prediction version of the Bayesian adaptive test produced almost perfectly fair performance on all fairness indices at high discrimination levels; and (4) the placement of subgroup prior distribution in the Bayesian adaptive testing procedure can affect test fairness.

CY  - NA
AB  - Previous studies have shown that, when administered a self-adapted test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a self-adapted test--lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT)--can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted self-adapted test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only in the region of their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class. The results show that while the RS-AT effectively controlled the standard errors of proficiency estimation, examinees receiving an RS-AT did not show higher mean proficiency or lower posttest state anxiety than examinees receiving a CAT.

JO  - NA
VL  - NA

CY  - NA
AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Two types of computerized testing have been defined: (1) computer-based testing, using a computer to administer conventional tests in which all examinees take the same set of items; and (2) adaptive tests, in which items are selected for administration by the computer, based on examinee's previous responses. This paper discusses an option for classroom teachers that is easier to develop than a computerized adaptive test, but more secure and sophisticated than a computer-based test. The process of developing and pilot testing the computer-administered test and the results of a survey of student reactions are described. Subjects for the study consisted of 108 undergraduates taking summer educational technology courses in computer applications at a Southern university. Identical items were used for paper-and-pencil and computerized tests. No significant differences were found for either administration. Student responses indicated that: all of the students had familiarity with computers; 94% had no problems understanding the test directions; 53% initially experienced anxiety about taking the test on a computer; 89% indicated that the computer test was as fair as a paper test; and 61% indicated a preference for the computer test, while 19% indicated that both methods worked equally well. Four tables depict results for computerized tests versus paper-and-pencil tests; descriptive data for both kinds of tests; students' yes/no responses to the attitude survey; and examinee's comments regarding computerized testing.

AB  - This study examined college students' motivational tendencies as predictors of academic outcomes and tested how students' goal orientations and academic delay of gratification mediated these associations. The study used data, previously analyzed in 1999, on academic delay of gratification, personal achievement goal orientations, self-efficacy, test anxiety, demographics, time dedicated to studying, and college grade point average. The results show that students' task goal orientation and academic delay of gratification mediate the relationship between self-efficacy and the time students dedicate to study. These results are considered under the umbrella of Zimmerman's cyclical model of self-regulation, which posits that learners engage in sustaining cognition, behavior, and emotions to pursue academic goals and intentions. The findings are also consistent with Mischel's self-regulatory approach, which assumes that effective delay of gratification is a function of motivation and voluntary postponement of immediate gratification in order to pursue later outcomes. The results demonstrate that students who have high self-efficacy are engaging in academic tasks for the sake of learning and mastering work, delay gratification and persist longer in goal directed study time. Implications for education and future research are discussed. Appended are: sample items from the Academic Volitional Strategy Scales and from the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey, Test Anxiety, Self-Efficacy and Reliability Cronbach Alphas.

JO  - NA

CY  - NA
AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - During 1975-1979 this research into the potential of computerized adaptive testing to reduce errors in the measurement of human capabilities used Marine recruits for a live-testing validity comparison of computerized adaptive and conventional tests. The program purposes were to: (1) identify the most useful computer-based adaptive testing strategies; (2) identify testing conditions that maximize the positive rather than negative psychological effects of computerized testing; (3) investigate intra-individual multidimensionality problems in ability testing; (4) examine probabilistic responding and free-response methods for computerized adaptive testing in order to extract maximum information from each test item response; and (5) develop, refine and evaluate new computer administered ability tests for spacial, perceptive, memory, and other abilities not now measurable using paper and pencil testing. Monte Carlo and Bayesian adaptive testing methods were used in these studies. Fifteen major findings, primarily on adaptive testing and test administration conditions, and implications for further research are given. Abstracts of the 16 research reports for studies for this program are given. (BS)

AB  - The differences in types of information-processing skills developed by different instructional backgrounds affect, negatively or positively, the learning of further advanced instructional materials. If prior and subsequent instructional methods are different, a proactive inhibition effect produces low achievement scores on a post test. This poses a serious problem for routing of students to an instructional level on the sole basis of performance on a diagnostic adaptive test and makes it essential to determine what information-processing strategy was used and consider this knowledge simultaneously. Response time often provides supplementary information which differentiates among individuals showing identical quality of performance. A model that reflects this kind of information, obtainable from response time scores, is formulated in a similar manner to latent trait theory. This model is useful in identifying discriminating items that are sensitive to differences in instructional method. It also is helpful in identifying an individual's instructional background to a certain extent. (Author/CTM)

CY  - NA
AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT.

AB  - Large-scale testing programs are generally based on the assumptions that the test-takers experience standard conditions for taking the test and that everyone will do his or her own work without having prior knowledge of specific questions. These assumptions are not necessarily true. The ways students and educators use to get around standardizing conditions to gain an advantage are described, and ways to reduce these behaviors are presented. In the first place, there is traditional cheating, by copying, or describing answers, which is enhanced by electronic gadgets or international exchanges of information. Lax security can result in the theft of test booklets. Teachers and other educators can undermine the validity of test by ignoring evidence of student preknowledge of the test or by tacitly colluding with students by allowing access to test materials. The measurement community needs to do a better job of educating educators about the importance of standard conditions. Testing agencies or programs should audit some testing sites to determine the existence of standard conditions, and new techniques of test administration, including computer adaptive tests, must be developed to improve test security.

AB  - During manufacturing test, more and more test patterns are added to test set to achieve acceptable defect levels, which seriously affect test cost. This paper proposes a kind of eliminate redundancy pattern method, so that this MRMR (Max-Relevance Min-Redundancy) algorithm which can provide test cost reduction without increasing the defect level obviously. Experiment results demonstrate that the valid test patterns have higher test quality, which can reduce the test time and test cost of the faulty circuit. The algorithm is completely software-based and does not require any additional hardware overhead and is directly compatible with traditional integrated circuit testing process.

AB  - This work aims to reduce the test time per chip, but affect the quality of the products only as little as possible compared to the conventional semiconductor test. For that purpose, a simulation software has been developed that performs adaptive test simulations based on real data and test results of conventional production testing. Product analyzes were performed and both the potential for test time savings and the resulting loss of quality were determined. Finally, it has shown that by the intelligent omission of tests, compared to conventional testing procedures, test time reduction of up to 50% can be achieved. In contrast, there are only few unrecognized defective components that are not detected by the adaptive test procedure and which reduced the quality of products. In best case, the fraction of nonconforming units was reduced down to values under 40ppm. To handle the potential risk of test escapes this paper also introduces a statistical estimation method.

AB  - This paper is an attempt to design and to evaluate the platform-independent computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system, which can expand the diversity of CAT-administering platforms. By using extensible markup language (XML) to describe the item bank, one might find the implementation of CAT on a different platform, such as a personal computer (PC), a personal digital assistant (PDA), and other handheld devices, more convenient. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of a CAT administration platform on precision and efficiency. Fifty senior high school students were selected to take an English vocabulary CAT both on PC and PDA, which enabled them to compare the relevant advantages with the disadvantages of the two different administration platforms firsthand. Both tests used the same-size, well-calibrated item bank, ability estimation algorithm, and item selection strategy. The results indicate that the platforms on which examinees take CAT do not affect the performance of CAT. The responses of the questionnaire on the testing environment also show that most examinees prefer to take the test on PDA. It is concluded that using a PDA to administer CAT is both as precise and effective as a PC and more enjoyable and convenient.

The IRT analysis includes: unidimensionality test, item model-data fitting test, local independence test, DIF test, and selecting items that meet the IRT requirements to construct a social anxiety question bank and its CAT. According to the two-stage adaptive assessment with similar significance in the evaluation scene design, the ITC_SoPI scale was used to evaluate the individual's degree of adaptation and subjective feeling to the virtual environment. VR-based social anxiety assessment can provide more detailed and comprehensive assessment information and data, and the assessment results are doser to the self-assessment scale and the individual's daily life and state.

AB  - Most recent e-learning platforms include testing modules and Computer Based Assessment (CBA) is currently one of the most pressing issues in Learning Management Systems (LMS). Traditional testing techniques aren't fully adequate to examination administration in higher education contexts, as they generally require choosing the answer just in a narrow set of options. Adaptive testing permits an evaluation more suitable for the examinee but it is affected by limits related to the uniformity of the exams, to the range/width of the subjects and to the large amount of items to be inserted in the question databases. e-Xamina is a prototype of assessment platform aimed at combining the features of these two main kinds of CBA. e-Xamina model suggests a new performance based exam pattern and a score criterion based on standard examination practice. Finally, e-Xamina multi-user feature allows the teachers to cooperate in managing course database, with many different levels of competence and rights.

AB  - Adaptive testing is a generic term for a number of techniques which aim at improving the test quality and/or reducing the test application costs. In adaptive tests, the test content or pass/fail limits are not fixed as in conventional tests, but dependent on other test results of the currently or previously tested chips. Part-average testing, outlier detection, and neighborhood screening are just a few examples of adaptive testing. With this Embedded Tutorial, we are offering an introduction to this topic, which is hot in the test community, to the wider DATE audience.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a modern alternative to classical paper and pencil testing. CAT is based on an automated selection of optimal item corresponding to current estimate of test-taker<e2><80><99>s ability, which is in contrast to fixed predefined items assigned in linear test. Advantages of CAT include lowered test anxiety and shortened test length, increased precision of estimates of test-takers<e2><80><99> abilities, and lowered level of item exposure thus better security. Challenges are high technical demands on the whole test work-flow and need of large item banks. In this study, we analyze feasibility and advantages of computerized adaptive testing using a Monte-Carlo simulation and post-hoc analysis based on a real linear admission test administrated at a medical college. We compare various settings of the adaptive test in terms of precision of ability estimates and test length. We find out that with adaptive item selection, the test length can be reduced to 40 out of 100 items while keeping the precision of ability estimates within the prescribed range and obtaining ability estimates highly correlated to estimates based on complete linear test (Pearson<e2><80><99>s $\rho$=0.96). We also demonstrate positive effect of content balancing and item exposure rate control on item composition.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive power of a computerized mathematics learning approach scale (CMLAS) change measure. The change of CMLAS is applied as an indicator for ICT infused mathematics intervention effect. A computerized dynamic assessment model which combines mathematics computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) and a two-phase ICT infused intervention is implemented in this study. The first intervention phase uses a spatial game to modify student's mathematics learning approach. The second intervention phase focuses on fostering the slow learner's automaticity of numerical operation. The results suggest that the assessment of goal orientation change is a good predictor for ICT infused mathematics intervention effect.

AB  - This study contributes to the orange technology on ML and employee positive emotion in the workplace. We propose that the motivating language (ML), positive emotion, especially the long-term positive emotion on the job generates favorable work outcomes. The current study examines the relationships between leader's ML, employee personality traits, and workplace outcomes in Chinese companies. The mediating effects of employee positive emotion and person-organization fit (P-O fit) in these relationships are also investigated. The results reveal that both ML and conscientiousness are significantly related to positive emotion, both of which play mediating roles in the relationship between ML, conscientiousness, and two of the three workplace outcomes. Test results also show that agreeableness affected all three employee outcomes through the effect of P-O fit.

AB  - Random testing (RT) and subdomain testing are two major software testing strategies. Their simplicity makes them likely the most efficient testing strategies with respect to the time required for test case selection. However, the disadvantage of RT is its defect detection effectiveness. Adaptive testing (AT) is a feedback-based software testing strategy that has been shown to be more effective than RT and partition testing (PT). However, a major concern in the application of AT is its complexity and computational cost for test case selection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that uses AT and random partition testing (RPT) in an alternating manner. The motivation for this approach is that both strategies are employed such that the underlying computational complexity of AT is reduced by introducing RPT into the testing process without affecting the defect detection effectiveness. A case study with seven real-life subject programs is presented. The experimental results demonstrate that this novel strategy considerably reduces the computational overhead of the original AT strategy but still outperforms the pure RT strategy and PT strategy in terms of the number of test cases used to detect and remove a given number of defects. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the robustness of our strategy.

AB  - Nanoelectronic circuits are increasingly affected by massive statistical process variations, leading to a paradigm shift in both design and test area. In circuit and system design, a broad class of methods for robustness like statistical design and self calibration has emerged and is increasingly used by the industry. The test community's answer to the massive-variation challenge is currently adaptive test. The test stimuli are modified on the fly (during test application) based on the circuit responses observed. The collected circuit outputs undergo statistical post-processing to facilitate pass/fail classification. We will present fundamentals of adaptive and robust test techniques and their theoretical background. While adaptive test is effective, the understanding how it covers defects under different process parameter combinations is not fully established yet with respect to algorithmic foundations. For this reason, novel analytic and algorithmic approaches in the field of variation-aware testing will also be presented in the tutorial. Coverage of defects in the process parameter space is modeled and maximized by an interplay between special fault simulation and multi-constrained ATPG algorithms. These systematic approaches can complement adaptive test application schemes to form a closed-loop system that combines analytical data with measurement results for maximal test quality.

AB  - The continuing miniaturization of LSI dimension is causing the increase of process-related variations which significantly affects not only its design turn around time but also its manufacturing yield. Statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) is expected as a promising way to estimate the performance of circuits more accurately considering delay variations. However, LSIs designed using SSTA may have higher probability of parametric faults than the ones designed with deterministic timing analysis. In order to test these parametric faults, effective extraction techniques of critical paths are needed. In this paper, we discuss a general trend between the delay margin of LSIs designed by SSTA and their parametric fault ratio. Then we propose an adaptive test flow for parametric faults using statistical static timing information, and a concept of parametric fault coverage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - The transonic wind tunnel TWG of DLR Gottingen has been modernized with respect to an improved flow quality as well as to the logistics of exchangeable test sections, operational reliability and productivity. It is presently equipped with a Laval nozzle (supersonic), a perforated test section (transonic) and a two-dimensional adaptive (subsonic) test section. The latter can perform 2D adaptive tests on wing profiles using the Cauchy integral formula for wall adaptation, as well as 2D wall adaptation for 3D models utilizing the Wedemeyer/Lamarche (VKI) procedure. For both cases the wall adaptation was successful. The 3D force results compare quite well nominally interference-free results and to results from another adaptive test section. The pressure distribution from the wing profile tests agree quite well with theoretical results. For the 3D model, residual wall interferences were determined. It was found that the wall interferences had been reduced to nearly zero on the centreline of the test section by wall adaptation. Spanwise averages of the residual wall interferences have been used for further corrections.

AB  - The issue of competence assessment in engineering is analyzed in the context of the lack of motivation for learning. The source of this lack of motivation comes from the distribution of high school students. This assignment creates marginalization for a large number of students. Exit from marginalization can be accomplished through additional motivation. This is the responsibility of the competence assessment system. The proposed system is based on Bloom's taxonomy, with the questions being based on Bloom's verbs. It results an adaptive test system where questions are tailored to each individual's level of training. Another condition for generating motivation is to waive the confidentiality of ratings. The main argument is that this confidentiality supports mediocrity. A tonic competition is preferred. The author's experience demonstrates that this kind of competition is possible, especially using the gamefication. There is also the graphical image of the evolution of competence assessed, called the trajectory in the competence field. The results may have very close scores, but nevertheless the assessment can separate the full skills from the insufficient competencies without diminishing the motivating nature of the test itself.

AB  - Computer programming learning is an important and challenging process for novice students. Previous approaches often address the learning problem of creating algorithm and familiarizing syntax. However, students still need the extra programming knowledge of selecting proper data structure to implement the program. In this paper, the scaffolding approach is used to assist students in comprehending the problem-solving strategy to find suitable data structure. In the experiment, 55 students participated in the two groups' pretest and posttest evaluation. The experimental results showed that the experimental group achieves higher learning achievement than the control group. The results suggest that computer-assisted scaffolding can be exploited as effective and motivational learning guidance for students.

AB  - The rotor position of a salient-pole permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) at standstill or rotating at low speed is often estimated by measuring the responses on high-frequency test signals. In some drives, the rotor position is computed by measuring important current ripples that are generated by supplying the PMSM periodically with high-frequency voltage test pulses. Besides these ripples, undesired distortions in the average-current samples have been measured. Simulation results have revealed that these distortions are caused by a test signal, as it produces a nonzero voltage deviation from the steady-state stator voltage. In this paper, a low-speed sensorless strategy is discussed where a strong reduction of the aforementioned distortions is obtained by adapting the test signals to the steady-state stator voltage. The main assumption is that an accurate estimation of the steady-state voltage is made by using the controller output. The computation of the adaptive test signals is done by taking into account the voltage restriction of the dc-bus voltage. Simulation results, as well as experimental measurements, indicate the effectiveness of the adaptive test signals in a sensorless controlled interior PMSM.

AB  - Studies in gamified e-learning tools lack on clarifying whether Gamification improves the user engagement and therefore the learning experience, or if the success depends on the system itself, independently of the Gamification process. As an attempt to start answering these questions, we present an existing adaptive self-evaluation tool where we have observed low engagement issues by analysing students' behaviour when using it during our previous experiences. Gamification can face those issues while maintain the system essence on dynamic adaptability. With the inclusion of Gamification mechanics in our existing environment, we will be able to measure if Gamification works, or if the system performance keeps as in the not-gamified version.

AB  - High temperature and process variation are undesirable effects for modern systems-on-chip. The high temperature is a prominent issue during test and should be taken care of during the test process. Modern SoCs, affected by large process variation, experience rapid and large temperature deviations and, therefore, a traditional static test schedule which is unaware of these deviations will be suboptimal in terms of speed and/or thermal-safety. This paper presents an adaptive test scheduling method which addresses the temperature deviations and acts accordingly in order to improve the test speed and thermal-safety. The proposed method is divided into a computationally intense offline-phase, and a very simple online-phase. In the offline-phase a schedule tree is constructed, and in the online-phase the appropriate path in the schedule tree is traversed, step by step and based on temperature sensor readings. Experiments have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - A particularly good software testing strategy is to achieve the underlying testing goal while solving the problems of tradeoffs between testing effectiveness and efficiency. To improve the fault detection effectiveness of software testing, the principle of feedback control theory was adopted, which motivated the proposal of dynamic random testing (DRT). The main idea behind DRT is using the testing results to guide the test case selection to increase the selection probabilities of the subdomains with higher fault detection rates. Previous works show that DRT strategy can achieve better effectiveness than random testing strategy and random partition testing strategy, and has significantly lower computational costs than adaptive testing strategy. However, the essential factors that affect the performance of DRT, i.e., adjusting parameters, initial profile, and test case classification have not been thoroughly investigated. Besides, some experimental assumptions are inconsistent with real scenarios. Therefore, this paper gives a series of investigations on DRT with a set of practical subject programs. More specifically, the effectiveness and efficiency of DRT are presented, and the extended experiments on DRT with relevant factors are conducted. The results indicate that the effectiveness of DRT is robust to different initial profiles and affected noticeably by the adjusting parameter settings and test case classification methods.

AB  - The advantages of creating multimedia item types and applying computer-based adaptive testing in education are: First, the capability to motivate learning by making the learners feel more engaged and interactive, as well as a better representation of concepts, which are not possible when using conventional multiple choice tests. Second, instead of following a curriculum designed for average students, an individual is given a customized curriculum suitable for his or her learning capability. However, the issue to address when achieving these goals is the enormous amount of item types required to transform the current multiple choice questions into multimedia formats, and the criteria used to determine the difficulty level of a multimedia question item. In this paper we propose a multimedia item shell design that not only reduces the number of item types required, but also computes difficulty level of an item automatically. The concept of question seed is also introduced to make content creation more cost-effective.

AB  - The expanded role of test demands a significant change in mind-set of nearly every engineer involved in the screening of semiconductor products. The issues to consider range from DFT and ATE requirements, to the design and optimization of test patterns, to the physical and statistical relationships of different tests, and finally, to the economics of reducing test time and cost. The identification of outliers to isolate latent defects will likely increase the role of statistical testing in present and future technologies. An emerging opportunity is to use statistical analysis of parametric measurements at multiple test corners to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of testing and reliability defect stressing. In this article, we propose a "statistical testing" framework that combines testing, analysis, and optimization to identify latent-defect signatures. We discuss the required characteristics of statistical testing to isolate the embedded-outlier population; test conditions and test application support for the statistical-testing framework; and the data modeling for identifying the outliers.

This approach of learning means that learning content is created and distributed in a very different manner to comply with differences among individuals. Providing personalized content is the major research topic for a huge no. of researchers. And sequentially is Computer adaptive test (CAT). Almost all of (CAT) systems' aim is to measure the examinees' ability to solve the selected questions regardless the quality of the learning process. Their objective is to choose the items which have the high probability to be solved with the current ability estimation. The proposed system aim is to measure the examinees' knowledge outcome in addition to evaluate the course itself in order to improve integrity of learning process pipe lines. Evaluating instructors is not based only on survey forms which may be affected by some good or bad feelings; but it also depends some scientific methods.

AB  - Manufacturing defects in nanoscale technologies have highly complex timing behaviour that is also affected by process variations. While conventional wisdom suggests that it is optimal to detect a delay defect through the longest sensitisable path, non-trivial defect behaviour along with modelling inaccuracies necessitate consideration of paths of well-controlled length during test generation. We present a generic methodology that yields tests through all sensitisable paths of user-specified length. The resulting tests can be employed within the framework of adaptive testing. The methodology is based on encoding the problem as a Boolean-satisfiability (SAT) instance and thereby leverages recent advances in SAT-solving technology.

AB  - Interactive multimedia content can help improve learning performance by enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. Multimedia content also can help improve concept representation, which is not possible in conventional multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank formats. In this article, we present a broader view of multimedia education, focusing on future applications. Our vision is to provide publicly accessible education anywhere, at anytime, and to anyone. To realize this vision, we propose the Computer Reinforced Online Multimedia Education (Crome) framework, which integrates the main components of education, including learning, teaching, and testing, as well as adaptive testing and student modeling.

AB  - SRAM testing is becoming more and more challenging due to issues caused by continuous device scaling. Fabricated SRAMs are submitted to random and systematic process variability, which strongly affect the cell's behavior and also the ability of test algorithms to detect faults. Traditionally, bias conditions have been used to improve the behavior of the SRAM under process variations by applying body bias to compensate for the effect of variability. Based on the same principle, bias conditions also affect the cell's behavior when resistive-opens are present, hence affecting test's defect coverage capability. Both body- and source-bias conditions are analyzed in this paper to find the way to improve defect detect ability in the SRAM cell. Source-biasing has been proven to be the more effective of the two, leading to more than 3X improvement of the defect detected value. Also, by adapting the source-bias conditions to process parameter values, over- and under-testing of the SRAM can be avoided.

AB  - Test cost is becoming increasingly significant percentage of COB (Cost of Build) in current SoCs (System-on-a-Chip). This is even critical in low cost markets like consumer devices. This session covers test cost reduction strategy that can be adopted on a typical semiconductor product, during design and post-silicon phases. Test cost reduction during design phase includes, adoption of right DFT (Design-For-Test) architectures and technologies, target ATE (Automated Test Equipment) selection and design for compliance for targeted ATE. DFT architectural aspects that can impact test cost reduction are multi-site configuration, concurrent tests, scan compression technology, IDDQ strategy, memory test and repair solution. Critical challenges of these techniques and design impact like gate count overhead, robust power grid design, route-ability and diagnose-ability would be covered. The impact of these techniques is quantified at SOC level, from test cost point of view. Post-silicon test cost reduction techniques include approaches like vector elimination based on statistical analysis of COF (Continue-on-Fail) data and program trimming techniques to optimize test program. Vector elimination directly affects DPPM (Defective Parts Per Million) requirements and hence needs to be handled carefully. Another powerful post-silicon technique that can reduce test time and improve yield is adaptive test. Adaptive tests include techniques like a) on-line statistical sampling, which can selectively skip tests that statistically never fail b) outlier detection and extraction, which helps to eliminate expensive reliability tests like burn-in. Adaptive tests can also be used to improve the yield by off-setting tester parameters as per site2site variations and using fab PCM (Process Control Monitor) data to optimize the device for performance and power through appropriate trimming. As the design community is pushing for higher concurrent and higher compression goals, test power is becoming a major consideration. While EDA solutions like low power ATPG is prevalent in industry, comprehensive test power architecture advisor, which can guide designer to architect DFT solutions which is optimal from both test time and test power is the need of the industry. Current state of solution on this problem is covered in this session.

AB  - Non-adaptive group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of n items into different pools and identifying defective items based on tests obtained for each pool. Motivated by applications in network tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation we formulate non-adaptive group testing problems on graphs. Unlike conventional group testing problems each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a graph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any set of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper we associate a test with a random walk. In this context conventional group testing corresponds to the special case of a complete graph on n vertices. For interesting classes of graphs we arrive at a rather surprising result, namely, that the number of tests required to identify d defective items is substantially similar to that required in conventional group testing problems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if T(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph G, we show that with m = O(d2T2(n) log(n/d)) non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective items. Consequently, for the Erd<c3><b5>s-R<c3><a9>nyi random graph G(n, p), as well as expander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that m = O(d2 log3 n) non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify d defective items. We next consider a specific scenario that arises in network tomography and show that m = O(d3 log3 n) non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify d defective items. We also consider noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing problem and develop parallel results for these cases.

AB  - Nonadaptive group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of n items into different pools. Each pool is then tested and defective items are identified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools required to identify at most d defective items. Motivated by applications in network tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of group testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group testing problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a graph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any set of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated with a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to the special case of a complete graph on n vertices. For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained, namely, that the number of tests required to identify d defective items is substantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing problems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if T(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph G, it is shown that with m = O(d2T2(n) log(n/d)) nonadaptive tests, one can identify the defective items. Consequently, for the Erdos-R<c3><a9>nyi random graph G(n, p), as well as expander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that m = O(d2 log3 n) non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify d defective items. Next, a specific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it is shown that m = O(d3 log3 n) nonadaptive tests are sufficient to identify d defective items. Noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing problem are considered, for which parallel results are developed. We also briefly discuss extensions to compressive sensing on graphs.

AB  - Coevolution is the process of mutual adaptation of two populations. When a difficult optimization is performed with evolutionary computation, a population of adaptive test cases can strongly affect the progress of evolution. This study applies coevolution to the Tartarus task, a grid robot test problem. If the coevolving test cases are viewed as a form of parasite, then the question of virulence becomes an important feature of the algorithm. This study compares different types of parasites for the Tartarus problem. The impact of coevolution in this study is at odds with intuition and statistically significant. Analysis of the different types of coevolution suggests that disruptive crossover has a key effect. In the presence of disruptive crossover, coevolution may need to be modified to be effective. Examples of these modifications are presented. The key method of dealing with disruptive crossover is tracking the age of the Tartarus agents. The age of an agent is defined to be the number of selection steps the agent has survived. Using only older agents to drive coevolution of test cases substantially enhances the performance of one of the two type of coevolution studied.

AB  - Many applications are being developed to leverage the popularity of mobile opportunistic networks. However, building adaptive testbeds can be costly and challenging. This challenge motivates the need for effective opportunistic network simulators to provide a variety of opportunistic environment setups, and evaluate proposed applications and protocols with a comprehensive set of metrics. This paper presents SAROS, a simulator of opportunistic networking environments with a variety of interest distributions, power consumption distributions, imported real traces, and social network integration. The simulator provides a wide variety of evaluation metrics that are not offered by comparable simulators. Finally, SAROS also implements several opportunistic forwarding algorithms ranging from social-oblivious algorithms to interest and power-aware social-based algorithms.

AB  - Education in the 21st century faces an increasing number of challenges that require intelligent systems. The learning environments of today and tomorrow must handle distributed and dynamically changing content, a geographical dispersion of students and teachers, and generations of learners who spend hours a day interacting with multimillion-dollar multimedia environments. The new learning environments are moving beyond kindergarten through college classrooms to distance learning, lifelong education, and on-the-job training; they're entering the multifaceted universe of virtual worlds and ambient spaces. The articles in this special issue report novel, cutting-edge, intelligent learning environments. The systems not only have intelligent computational architectures but also are empirically tested on humans. Empirical research is of course essential to test system fidelity in delivering the intended pedagogy and to assess learning gains, usability, and learner satisfaction. This article is part of a special issue on intelligent educational systems.

AB  - The adoption of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) instead of classical testing (FIT) raises questions from both teachers' and students' perspectives. The scientific literature shows that teachers using CAT instead of FIT should experience shorter times to complete the assessment and obtain more precise evaluations. As for the students, adaptive testing seems to increase their engagement, whereas the impossibility to revise the already given questions is usually seen as a detrimental characteristic. In such a context, the paper reports on a study concerning the aforementioned points. The outcomes seem almost all inline with the literature: no particular usability issues were detected, CAT is faster than FIT, and CAT does not seem more engaging than FIT. All these findings are reported in the conclusions as a list of suggestions to teachers interested in switching from FIT to CAT.

AB  - The present study extended the "p"-optimality method to the multistage computerized adaptive test (MST) context in developing optimal item pools to support different MST panel designs under different test configurations. Using the Rasch model, simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 simulated optimal item pools were generated and evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. Results showed that the optimal item pools built with the "p"-optimality method provide sufficient measurement accuracy under all simulated MST panel designs. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but not the item distributions and item pool characteristics. This study demonstrated that the "p"-optimality method can adapt to MST item pool design, facilitate the MST assembly process, and improve its scoring accuracy.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) selects each item to match with an examinee<e2><80><99>s ability level during the test. In contrast, multistage adaptive testing (MST) administers a group of items instead of each individual item adaptively. A hybrid design combines CAT and MST borrowing strengths from both testing modes. However, existing research studies indicate that there is lack of knowledge on hybrid designs in passage-based adaptive testing, including situations where misrouting occurs. Misrouting refers to when examinees get routed to paths that don<e2><80><99>t match with their true ability levels. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the proposed hybrid designs (HMCAT designs) with respect to ability estimation accuracy under different MST configurations and their performance when misrouting occurs. The HMCAT designs under passage-based adaptive testing control test adaptability at both passage/stimulus level and item level. Four proposed HMCAT designs differ by implementing the item level CAT at different stages of the MST. Specifically, among all four designs, the two most extreme designs are the one implementing CAT across all stages (CC) and the one not implementing CAT across any stage (PP). The two hybrid designs include implementing CAT only in the routing stage (CP) and implementing CAT only in the last stage (PC). The hybrid designsâ€™ performance compared to that of the CC design and the PP design when interacting with different MST configurations and when misrouting occurs are the two main research questions of the study. The three-phase simulation analysis indicates that (1) the PC design achieves more accurate final ability estimation results under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (2) although the CP design fails to perform effectively when misrouting occurs under the three-stage MST configuration, it is still able to achieve accurate final ability estimation results under both two-stage MST configurations; (3) the CC design and the PP design achieve similar and the most accurate final ability estimation results under all four MST configurations; (4) the PC design reaches similar accuracy as the CC design and the PP design under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (5) the CP design reaches a similar accuracy level as the CC design and the PP design under both two-stage MST configurations; (6) the CP design is affected the most when misrouting occurs in the three-stage MST configuration, whereas the other three HMCAT designs are not affected. In general, findings from simulation analyses suggest that the HMCAT designs are effective enough to use in passage/stimulus-based adaptive tests with appropriate MST configurations. They also contain advantages such as greater flexibility with respect to content balancing, test security and control on item administration. However, it is important to understand that the performance of HMCAT designs can heavily depend on the MST configuration, the item pool characteristics, the test design and components in the test administration algorithm, such as content balancing strategies. Results from the current study provide implications for practitioners on how to decide on an appropriate HMCAT design under real testing contexts and how to evaluate and maintain the selected HMCAT design to effectively implement the design in practice.

AB  - In recent years, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has been widely used in educational and clinical settings. The basic idea of CAT is relatively straightforward. A computer is used to administer items tailored for individuals to maximize the measurement precision of their proficiency estimates. However, the administration of CAT is not so simple. Those who administer CATs must, while trying to optimize an item selection criterion, consider a variety of practical issues such as test security, content balancing, the purpose of testing, and other test specifications. Such extraneous factors make it possible that a CAT might have so many constraints that in practice it is barely adaptive at all. This concern is at the forefront of the current study, which poses two key questions: How adaptive is a highly adaptive test really? How can the level of adaptation be improved? This study aims to develop three new statistical indicators to measure the amount of adaptation conditional on the examineesâ€™ proficiency levels in CAT. It also aims to evaluate the feasibility and utility of these adaptation measures in helping to diagnose and improve adaptivity that occurs during the CAT administration. Extending work done by Reckase, Ju, and Kim (2018), the proposed measures are based on three componentsâ€”the differences in the locations between the selected items and the examineeâ€™s current proficiency estimates, the variations in the item locations administered to each examinee, and the magnitude of information that the test presents to each examinee. Hence, they can be used to assess adaptivity during the CAT process, as well as to identify differences in the level of adaptation for individuals or subgroups of examinees. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptation indices, this study conducted analyses of real operational testing data from a healthcare licensure examination, as well as comprehensive simulation studies under various conditions that affect adaptivity in a CAT. The key findings of the study suggest that the proposed adaptation indices are likely to function as intended to sensitively detect the magnitude of adaptivity for a CAT over the proficiency continuum. These new measures shed light on how much adaptation of a given test occurs across individual proficiency levels or subpopulations. With some guidelines for the interpretation of these measures recommended in this study, the adaptation indices can also readily serve as diagnostic tools in practice for helping test practitioners design item pools and adaptive tests that support high adaptivity.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - This study focused on the effect of examinees' ability levels on the relationship between Reflective-Impulsive (RI) cognitive style and item response time in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The total of 56 students majoring in Educational Technology from Shandong Normal University participated in this study, and their RI cognitive styles were diagnosed using the Matching Familiar Figures Test-20 (MFFT-20). Examinees' ability values and average item response time were recorded by the computerized adaptive testing system. Then mediation analysis was implemented and the findings revealed that there was direct and indirect effect between RI cognitive style and item response time in CAT. What is more, RI cognitive style also directly affected the ability levels, and then the ability levels impacted on item response time. So, examinee's ability level was partly a mediator between RI cognitive style and item response time. Furthermore, RI cognitive style of the examinees might also be diagnosed according to ability values and average item response time. The relevant research and implications were further discussed.

AB  - The present study investigated the implications of computer-adaptive testing (operationalized by way of multistage adaptive testing; MAT) and "conventional" fixed order computer testing for various test-relevant outcomes in numeracy, including achievement, test-relevant motivation and engagement, and subjective test experience. It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students' test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students' test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged.

AB  - As perfectly summarised by Ida Lawrence, "Testing is growing by leaps and bounds across the world. There is a realization that a nation's well-being depends crucially on the educational achievement of its population. Valid tests are an essential tool to evaluate a nation's educational standing and to implement efficacious educational reforms. Because tests consume time that otherwise could be devoted to instruction, it is important to devise tests that are efficient. Doing so requires a careful balancing of the contributions of technology, psychometrics, test design, and the learning sciences. Computer adaptive multistage testing (MSCAT) fits the bill extraordinarily well; unlike other forms of adaptive testing, it can be adapted to educational surveys and student testing. Research in this area will be an evidence that the methodologies and underlying technology that surround MSCAT have reached maturity and that there is a growing acceptance by the field of this type of test design" (from the Foreword to Y. Duanli, A. A. von Davier, & L. Charles (Eds.), "Computerized multistage testing: theory and application"). This state-of-the-art paper aims to present an overview of differential item functioning (DIF) in MSCAT using three-parameter logistic item response theory (IRT), offering suggestions to implement it in practice with a hope to motivate testing and assessment researchers and practitioners to initiate projects in this under-practiced area by helping them to better understand some of the relevant technical concepts.

AB  - Vocabulary knowledge assessment methods and instruments have gone through a significant evolution. Computer-based tests offer more opportunities than their paper-and-pencil counterparts, however, most digital vocabulary assessments are linear and adaptive solutions in this domain are scarce. The aims of this study were to compare the effectiveness of a multi-stage adaptive and a linear test system of vocabulary knowledge both at test and individual level and to examine the impact of the used assessment method on students' performance and motivation measured through the number of the right answers within a test. Data show that the adaptive test system provided a more accurate ability estimation with higher reliability, a more motivating test environment and more precision than the linear version.

AB  - In recent years, the multistage adaptive test (MST) has gained increasing popularity in the field of educational measurement and operational testing. MST refers to a test in which pre-constructed sets of items are administered adaptively and are scored as a unit (Hendrickson, 2007). As a special case of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), a MST program needs the following components: an item response theory (IRT) model or non-IRT-based alternatives; an item pool design; module assembly; ability estimation; routing algorithm; and scoring (Yan et al., 2014). A significant amount of research has been conducted on components like module assembly, ability estimation, routing and scoring, but few studies have addressed the component of item pool design. An item pool is defined as consisting of a maximal number of combinations of items that meet all content specifications for a test and provide sufficient item information for estimation at a series of ability levels (van der Linden et al., 2006). An item pool design is very important because any successful MST assembly is inseparable from an optimal item pool that provides sufficient and high-quality items (Luecht & Nungester, 1998). Reckase (2003, 2010) developed the p-optimality method to design optimal item pools using the unidimensional Rasch model in CAT, and it has been proved to be efficient for different item types and IRT models. The present study extended this method to MST context in supporting and developing different MST panel designs under different test configurations. The study compared the performance of the MST assembled under the most popularly studied panel designs in the literature, such as 1-2, 1-3, 1-2-2, and 1-2-3. A combination of short, medium and long tests with different routing test proportions were used to build up different tests. Using one of the most popularly investigated IRT models, the Rasch model, simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 optimal items pools were generated and the measurement accuracy was evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. The p-optimality method was also applied in an operational MST licensure test to see if it is feasible in supporting test assembly and achieving sufficient measurement accuracy in practice. Results showed that the different MST panel designs achieved sufficient measurement accuracy by using the items from the optimal item pools built with the p-optimality method. The same was true with the operational item pool. Measurement accuracy was related to test length, but not so much to the routing test proportions. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but the distributions of the item parameters and item pool characteristics for all the MST panel designs were similar under the two conditions. The item pool sizes under the exposure control conditions were several times larger than those under no exposure control, depending on the types of MST panel designs and routing test proportions. The results from this study provide information for how to enhance item pool utilization when designing multistage computerized adaptive tests, facilitating the MST assembly process, and improving the scoring accuracy.

AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been largely limited to investigating traits with a single time measurement. However, many prospective cohort studies and electronic health record (EHR)-based cohorts with GWAS data have collected traits with repeated measurements across follow-up time. Effectively utilizing the information embedded in the time trajectory of measurements could greatly increase the power of association testing. Local association signal patterns across the whole genome are usually variable, complicated and unpredictable, which underscores the need for a data adaptive test capable of maintaining high statistical power across different genetic architecture and association signal patterns. Furthermore, complex diseases are usually affected by multiple variants in a gene and multiple genes in a biological pathway. In addition, traditional single SNP-based association testing has very limited statistical power for variants of low to rare minor allele frequency (MAF < 5% or 1%). A SNP-set-based association test, e.g., based on genes or pathways, could boost the statistical power by aggregating individual weak to moderate association signals across a region of interest. In this dissertation, I have developed such powerful data-adaptive tests that address these analytical challenges facing association testing between longitudinal traits and rare or common variants. I implemented extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed tests, and illustrated their applications in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. I also produced a software package with documentation to implement the proposed tests in high performance computing platform. In conclusion, this dissertation paves a new path in extending the traditional association tests to longitudinal traits, helps identify novel genes and explain the missing heritability in human complex diseases.

AB  - There has been a notable lack of change in psychological assessment practices over the last several decades despite vast improvements in science and technology. The use of item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) in other testing domains has yielded positive results, but these practices have not gained widespread use in psychological assessment. Research has shown that the item response theory methodology can yield important information about assessments not available to researchers through classical test theory, and computer adaptive testing can result in significant item reductions and shorter test administration times. Thus, the current study evaluated whether a single set of items that measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with differential item functioning less than |<c2><b1>0.3| across the three demographic variables of gender, age, and education can be identified. Research has consistently shown that an internalized distress dimension is prevalent in the literature on self-rated mood, as well as in the MMPI-2 item pool. IRT analyses were used to investigate for age, gender, and education bias in a sample of 4,493 participants with 250 participants for most combinations of demographic variables (age [3], education [3], gender [2]). Age, education, and gender bias was most often seen in comparisons for participants in the 60 to 79 year old age group for all three scales. The Welsh Anxiety (A) scale showed the greatest number of items (19) with DIF greater than |<c2><b1>0.3|across the three demographic variables. Differential item functioning was most prevalent when there were significant disparities between the two groups being evaluated. Overall, results showed that there were 22 items that were relatively unbiased for each combination of demographic variables. Internalized Distress (ID) had the greatest number of unbiased items across the various combinations of demographic variables, with 19 items showing relatively no bias. These findings indicate that it is possible to develop a computer adaptive assessment to measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with enough items that are free from bias for age, education, and gender. Further exploration of computer-adaptive administration of the MMPI-2 and other self-report inventories seems warranted because of its ability to provide comparable information frequently with considerable time saving for individuals.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the dimensionality of the Neuroticism scale of the Basic Traits Inventory in order to contribute to the larger project of developing computer adaptive testing for the five scales of the Basic Traits Inventory. The Neuroticism scale comprises the general factor of Neuroticism and four group factors or facets, namely, Affective Instability, Depression, Self-Consciousness, and Anxiety (Taylor & De Bruin, 2006; Taylor & De Bruin, 2013).Personality constructs and scales are complex as they typically comprise heterogeneous items for reliability and validity purposes (Reise, Morizot, & Hays, 2007). It is therefore to be expected that some studies present evidence of a scale that measures an overarching single dimension <e2><80><93> unidimensionality <e2><80><93> whilst other studies find evidence of multiple dimensions <e2><80><93> multidimensionality (Gibbons et al., 2007; Immekus & Imbrie, 2008; Reise, Moore, & Haviland, 2010). Consequently, specification of a strictly unidimensional model is often not realistic for complex personality constructs and scales. However, test-developers and researchers aspire to unidimensionality (Zinbarg, Yovel, Revelle, & McDonald, 2006) as unidimensionality allows for the unambiguous interpretation of scale scores (Reise et al., 2010), is considered a precondition to reliability and validity, encourages the use of a total score (Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma, 2003), meets the unidimensional assumption of item response theory models, and is the prerequisite for the development of computer adaptive testing (Thomas, 1990; Weiss & Gibbons, 2007).Against this background, the key question that was posed in this study was not whether the Neuroticism scale was strictly unidimensional or not, but rather if the scale was unidimensional enough to allow for the meaningful interpretation of a total score (Morizot, Ainsworth, & Reise, 2009). This study focussed on attaining evidence of the presence of a strong general factor which would justify the interpretation of a total score and for applying unidimensional item response theory models to the scale (Reise, 2012).The Basic Traits Inventory was completed by 1 966 participants from various industries and organisations within South Africa. Statistical analyses were performed on the responses to the Neuroticism scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to investigate the unidimensionality and strength of the general factor of the scale, while evaluating the influence of multidimensionality on the interpretation of the general factor or the total score. This dimensionality investigation of the scale was achieved by comparing three confirmatory factor models using the goodness-of-fit indices and the standardised factor loadings of the models. The competing structural models were: a one-factor or unidimensional model which represented the general factor and interpretation of a total score for the scale; a four-factor or multidimensional model which represented the multiple factors of the scale and therefore the interpretation of the group factors or facets; and a bifactor model which allowed for the examination of the strength of the general factor in comparison to that of the group factors of the scale.The results of this study confirmed that the Neuroticism scale is multidimensional as the scale comprises multiple group factors or facets. However, the findings of the study revealed the strong presence of a general factor that runs through all the items of the scale, and consequently suggest that efforts to make use of and interpret separate subscale scores lack the needed empirical evidence to do so. In essence, the findings of the study demonstrated that the presence of unidimensionality in the scale is prominent despite the multidimensionality of the scale, which confirmed that the interpretation of the total score for the scale is justified and preferred irrespective of the multidimensionality of the scale.Overall, the findings and evidence of this study proposed that the Neuroticism scale is unidimensional enough to meet the unidimensional assumption of item response theory models. Accordingly, these results support the advancement of adapting the Neuroticism scale of the Basic Traits Inventory for computer adaptive testing (Reise, 2012; Thomas, 1990; Weiss & Gibbons, 2007).This study further confirmed that when developing a multifaceted scale, it is essential to analyse the dimensionality of the scale in order to determine what the scale is actually measuring. The bi factor model can be employed in the development, exploration and confirmation of the dimensionality of the scale to examine the strength of the general factor relative to the multiple group factors of the scale.

AB  - Decisions involved in designing high-stakes tests include whether to give examinees feedback and, if it is given, how to display the feedback to them. Researchers have yet to examine the effects of item response theory-related feedback on state test anxiety and examinees<e2><80><99> perceptions of fairness when said feedback is given on an item-by-item basis <e2><80><93> such as during a computer adaptive test. To address these gaps in the literature, this experiment examined the effects of feedback on state test anxiety and perceived test fairness, accounting for individual differences in feedback acceptance, exam performance, and performance goal orientation. These effects were examined across three modes of item-by-item feedback (i.e., text feedback, graphical feedback, and text/graphical feedback together) during a computer adaptive test in an online sample (N = 338). A three-way interaction occurred between text and graphical feedback, test performance, and prove performance goal orientation. As expected, among those who received feedback, there was a significant, positive relationship between feedback acceptance and perceived test fairness. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) purports to combine the strengths of both CAT and cognitive diagnosis. Cognitive diagnosis models aim at classifying examinees into the correct mastery profile group so as to pinpoint the strengths and weakness of each examinee whereas CAT algorithms choose items to determine those strengths and weakness as efficiently as possible. Most of the existing CD-CAT item selection algorithms are evaluated when test length is relatively long whereas several applications of CD-CAT, such as in interim assessment, require an item selection algorithm that is able to accurately recover examinees' mastery profile with short test length. In this article, we introduce the mutual information item selection method in the context of CD-CAT and then provide a computationally easier formula to make the method more amenable in real time. Mutual information is then evaluated against common item selection methods, such as Kullback-Leibler information, posterior weighted Kullback-Leibler information, and Shannon entropy. Based on our simulations, mutual information consistently results in nearly the highest attribute and pattern recovery rate in more than half of the conditions. We conclude by discussing how the number of attributes, Q-matrix structure, correlations among the attributes, and item quality affect estimation accuracy.

AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

AB  - The computer-adaptive multistage testing (ca-MST) has been developed as an alternative to computerized adaptive testing (CAT), and been increasingly adopted in large-scale assessments. Current research and practice only focus on ca-MST panels for credentialing purposes. The ca-MST test mode, therefore, is designed to gauge a single scale. The present study is the first step to investigate ca-MST panels for diagnostic purposes, which involve the assessment of multiple attributes in the same test. This study employed computer simulation to compare multidimensional ca-MST panels and their unidimensional counterparts, and to explore the factors that affect the accuracy and efficiency of multidimensional ca-MST. Nine multidimensional ca-MST panel designs--which differed in configuration and test length--were simulated under varied attribute correlation scenarios. In addition, item pools with different qualities were studied to suggest appropriate item bank design. The comparison between the multidimensional ca-MST and a sequential of unidimensional ca-MST suggested that when attributes correlated moderate to high, employing a multidimensional ca-MST provided more accurate and efficient scoring decisions than several unidimensional ca-MST with IRT scoring. However, a multidimensional ca-MST did not perform better than its unidimensional counterpart with MIRT scoring. Nevertheless, multidimensional panels are still promising for diagnostic purposes given practical considerations. The investigation on multidimensional ca-MST design indicated the following: Higher attribute correlation was associated with better scoring decision because more information carried by a correlation matrix was available for estimation. This held true across all item pool conditions. An optimal item pool would be the one that was discriminative, appropriately located and specifically designed for a configuration. The accuracy and efficiency of a multidimensional ca-MST panel would be diminished if its item pool was too easy, or not informative. According to the results, the 1-2-3 configuration design was most promising. In terms of test length, an appropriate decision would largely depend on the attribute correlation and the item pool characteristics.

AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally-developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adaptive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and a classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators<e2><80><99> responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators<e2><80><99> experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback be solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of CATSIB (Computer Adaptive Testing-Simultaneous Item Bias Test) for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) when items in the matching and studied subtest are administered adaptively in the context of a realistic multi-stage adaptive test (MST). MST was simulated using a 4-item module in a 7-panel administration. Three independent variables, expected to affect DIF detection rates, were manipulated: item difficulty, sample size, and balanced/unbalanced design. CATSIB met the acceptable criteria, meaning that the Type I error and power rates met 5% and 80%, respectively, for the large reference/moderate focal sample and the large reference/large focal sample conditions. These results indicate that CATSIB can be used to consistently and accurately detect DIF on an MST, but only with moderate to large samples. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)

JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

PY  - 2012
PB  - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
CY  - United States -- Illinois
AB  - Four item selection methods are compared and investigated under three test formats in the context of Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing (MCAT) delivering polytomous items partially or completely in tests. Item selection methods examined include Fisher information based D-optimality (D-optimality), Kullback-Leibler information index (KI), mutual information (MI), and continuous entropy method (CEM). The three test formats considered are the POLYTYPE format that contains polytomous items with three response categories, the DPMIX format that delivers dichotomous items at the beginning and polytomous items at the final stage, and the PDMIX format that has the reverse order as DPMIX. In general, D-optimality shows the best estimation accuracy and conditional estimation accuracy. D-optimality, MI, and CEM are similar in terms of ability estimation accuracy and tendency in selecting items when the item bank size is large. For both dichotomous and polytomous items, KI is mostly outperformed by the other three methods in terms of ability estimation precision. When sub-thetas in both dimensions are equal, however, KI shows the best performance for polytomous items. In this study, which item type, dichotomous or polytomous, being administered first does not affect the estimation accuracy. However, if the test length is much longer or shorter than the test length of the current study, it is possible that the estimation accuracy could be affected by the order of delivering different item types. Both DPMIX and PDMIX formats yield similar conditional estimation accuracy pattern and precision. In addition, the item bank size does affect the estimation precision. These conclusions, however, might not be applied to MCAT testing with different test designs or item pool structures. More studies are needed in MCAT combining with polytomous items to further facilitate the development and improvement of the next-generation assessments such as formative assessment or testing for diagnosis.

AB  - In recent years, many computerized test systems have been developed for diagnosing students' learning profiles. Nevertheless, it remains a challenging issue to find an adaptive testing algorithm to both shorten testing time and precisely diagnose the knowledge status of students. In order to find a suitable algorithm, four adaptive testing algorithms, based on ordering theory, item relational structure theory, Diagnosys, and domain experts, were evaluated based on the training sample size, prediction accuracy, and the use of test items by the simulation study with paper-based test data. Based on the results of simulation study, ordering theory has the best performance. An ordering-theory-based knowledge-structure-adaptive testing system was developed and evaluated. The results of this system showed that the two different interfaces, paper-based and computer-based, did not affect the examinees' performance. In addition, the effect of correct guessing was discussed, and two methods with adaptive testing algorithms were proposed to mitigate this effect. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods improve the effect of correct guessing. (Contains 6 tables and 18 figures.)

AB  - Biomarker-directed targeted designs have been developed in recent years for pharmaceutical development for patient subpopulation with specific disease etiology. Multistage testing and adaption are desired for targeted designs to manage the risk of study population deviation, to conduct interim analysis and to make decisions on stochastic curtailment. We propose a multistage adaptive design for targeted trials that allows flexibility in multistage testing, stochastic curtailment decision-making, biomarker performance monitoring and biomarker performance-based sample size adaption. The design is based on the theorem that the sequence of test statistics from multistage testings asymptotically satisfies Brownian motion in different targeted trial settings. The theorem is proven for both continuous and binary endpoints. The simulation analysis has indicated that targeted multistage designs perform better than its untargeted counterpart in trial efficiency, effective information accumulation and stochastic curtailment decision-making by selecting targeted patients. However, this study has shown that biomarker performance influences heterogeneity of targeted study population and consequently affects planning and multistage testing of a targeted trial. The impact of biomarker performance has been extensively examined with regard to study efficiency, actual statistical power, type-I error, information accrument, and stochastic curtailment decision-making. To cope with the limited information of biomarker performance at study planning, we propose the biomarker performance-based sample size adaption for targeted trials for continuous and binary endpoints, respectively. The adaptive method can update actual biomarker performance at interim analysis and re-estimate sample size to achieve planned statistical power while preserving type-I error rate. In summary, the multistage adaptive design improves targeted trials by providing great flexibility in multistage testing, early stopping, biomarker performance monitoring and biomarker performance-based sample size adaption.

AB  - Given the rapid advancement of computer technology, the importance of administering adaptive tests with polytomous items is in great need. With regard to the applicability of adaptive testing using polytomous IRT models, adaptive testing can use polytomous items of either rating scales, or in some testing situations of multiple choice. Additionally, the availability of computerized polytomous scoring of open-ended items enhances such applicability. This need promotes the research in polytomous adaptive testing (PAT). This dissertation is an effort to focus on item selection methods, as a major component, in polytomous computerized adaptive testing. So, it consists of five chapters that cover the following: Chapter 1 focuses on a thorough introduction to the item response theory (IRT) models and adaptive testing related to polytomous items. Such an important overview and introduction to basic concepts in test theory and mathematical models for polytomous items is needed for the flow of consequent chapters. Chapter 2 is devoted to the development of a central location index (LI) to uniquely represent the polytomous item with a scale value parameter using most commonly used polytomous models. The motivation and rationale to search for a central or an overall location parameter is twofold: (a) the confusion of multiple and different parameterizations for a polytomous item even for the same model, and (b) the unavailability of such single location parameter block the usage of certain item selection methods in adaptive testing. Two approaches are used to derive the proposed LIs, one is based on the item category response functions (ICRFs) and the other is based on the polytomous item response function (IRF). As a result, four LIs are proposed. Chapter 3 is particularly assigned to development of an item selection method based on the developed location index and primarily assess its performance in the PAT context relative to existing methods. This method belongs to the non-information based item selection methods and we referred it as Matching-LI method. The results support that this proposed method is promising and is capable to produce accurate ability estimates and successfully manage the item pool usage. Chapter 4 introduces new item selection methods taking in consideration the previous chapter's results. The new methods are the hybrid, stage-based information, polytomous a-stratification methods. The first two methods try to merge more than one criterion for selecting items of each PAT (e.g., the hybrid method merges both the Matching-LI and maximum information (MI) methods). The last method uses Matching-LI method within each stratum. Chapter 5 provides discussion, conclusions, and limitations and future research directions with respect to important components of an adaptive testing program (i.e., item selection methods, item response models, item banks, and trait versus attribute estimation).

AB  - The popularity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is increasing rapidly. In order to make learning environments more efficient, researchers have been exploring the possibility of an automatic adaptation of the learning environment to the learner or the context. One of the possible adaptation techniques is adaptive item sequencing by matching the difficulty of the items to the learner's knowledge level. This is already accomplished to a certain extent in adaptive testing environments, where the test is tailored to the person's ability level by means of the item response theory (IRT). Even though IRT has been a prevalent computerized adaptive test (CAT) approach for decades and applying IRT in item-based ITSs could lead to similar advantages as in CAT (e.g. higher motivation and more efficient learning), research on the application of IRT in such learning environments is highly restricted or absent. The purpose of this paper was to explore the feasibility of applying IRT in adaptive item-based ITSs. Therefore, we discussed the two main challenges associated with IRT application in such learning environments: the challenge of the data set and the challenge of the algorithm. We concluded that applying IRT seems to be a viable solution for adaptive item selection in item-based ITSs provided that some modifications are implemented. Further research should shed more light on the adequacy of the proposed solutions. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - Current interest in measuring quality of life is generating interest in the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) with Likert-type items. Calibration of an item bank for use in CAT requires collecting responses to a large number of candidate items. However, the number is usually too large to administer to each subject in the calibration sample. The concurrent anchor-item design solves this problem by splitting the items into separate subtests, with some common items across subtests; then administering each subtest to a different sample; and finally running estimation algorithms once on the aggregated data array, from which a substantial number of responses are then missing. Although the use of anchor-item designs is widespread, the consequences of several configuration decisions on the accuracy of parameter estimates have never been studied in the polytomous case. The present study addresses this question by simulation, comparing the outcomes of several alternatives on the configuration of the anchor-item design. The factors defining variants of the anchor-item design are (a) subtest size, (b) balance of common and unique items per subtest, (c) characteristics of the common items, and (d) criteria for the distribution of unique items across subtests. The results of this study indicate that maximizing accuracy in item parameter recovery requires subtests of the largest possible number of items and the smallest possible number of common items; the characteristics of the common items and the criterion for distribution of unique items do not affect accuracy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether the efficiency, precision, and validity of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) could be improved by assessing confidence differences in knowledge that examinees possessed. We proposed a novel polytomous CAT model called the confidence-weighting computerized adaptive testing (CWCAT), which combined a confidence-weighting scoring scheme with the graded response model (GRM). The CWCAT provided a more interactive testing environment by focusing on the examinees' confidence in their responses. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the comparison between the CWCAT and conventional CAT in terms of efficiency, precision, and validity. As expected, the polytomous method provided better discrimination among individual differences in the confidence in knowledge and required fewer items per examinee. Results also showed that CWCAT yielded ability estimates that were higher and better correlated to examinees' performance in English learning. Furthermore, the ability measured by CWCAT was not as likely to be affected by guessing as on conventional CAT, and, therefore, was more consistent with examinees' true ability.

AB  - School districts across the country are meeting the accountability challenges set forth by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) federal legislation, as well as challenges put forth at their state and local levels. Districts' accountability efforts have often brought them to contract with outside organizations offering standardized assessments for progress monitoring of students in intervention programs, and for on-going local assessments for program evaluation and planning. One such organization, Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), has developed several computer-based testing products to assist districts in their accountability and teaching/learning efforts. Their flagship product, Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), is a computerized-adaptive test (CAT), and is typically delivered on-line to districts. Using Item Response Theory (IRT) selection algorithms, test questions are selected based on students' answers throughout the test experience. Students are presented with their first question (item) based on a predetermined value of their ability from previous testing and what is known about the item (Baker, 2001). Once they respond to the item, the software calibrates a temporary achievement level for that student, and selects their next question based on their estimated competency. Use of such powerful test assembly methods can enable a test to derive precise performance information about each student. Tests are assembled on demand, and results are immediately available to instructors and district personnel. While precise information at a broader range of abilities is possible using such test assembly methods, item selection processes typically present items in a randomized order to maximize item bank usage, test security, and measurement properties. Little research has been done on item order with young test takers in the elementary grades, and the literature on item order with regard to computerized adaptive testing is silent. Of particular interest was whether a content-clustered version of a computerized adaptive test would result in stronger performance with young test takers, and whether the efficient testing processes already available via on-line testing could be improved. Data was reviewed in light of demographic sub-groups, including gender, ethnicity, and grade level. The current study delivered both the standard version of a computerized adaptive test, MAP, along with a modified version, to a test population of 6589 students in a large southern U.S. school district of second, third, fourth and fifth graders. Using a double-blind selection process, half of the students received the standard MAP, and half received the modified version, which clustered items by goal strand across the five sub-tests of the assessment. The study indicated that overall scores on MAP are not increased by content clustering, nor are there significant time gains on the overall test, for all students as a whole. However, results do indicate areas of significance with regard to ethnic sub-group differences. Overall test performance was stronger for African Americans on the modified version, while overall test duration was reduced for the three major ethnic sub-groups, particularly Hispanics. Boys improved their scores overall on the modified version, and gender differences on goal strands were present, which may indicate that certain goal strands scores increase under clustered conditions.

AB  - With the rapid growth of computer and mobile technology, it is a challenge to integrate computer based test (CBT) with mobile learning (m-learning) especially for formative assessment and self-assessment. In terms of self-assessment, computer adaptive test (CAT) is a proper way to enable students to evaluate themselves. In CAT, students are assessed through a process that uses item response theory (IRT), a well-founded psychometric theory. Furthermore, a large item bank is indispensable to a test, but when a CAT system has a large item bank, the test item selection of IRT becomes more tedious. Besides the large item bank, item exposure mechanism is also essential to a testing system. However, IRT all lack the above-mentioned points. These reasons have motivated the authors to carry out this study. This paper describes a design issue aimed at the development and implementation of an adaptive testing system. The system can support several assessment functions and different devices. Moreover, the researchers apply a novel approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO) to alleviate the computational complexity and resolve the problem of item exposure. Throughout the development of the system, a formative evaluation was embedded into an integral part of the design methodology that was used for improving the system. After the system was formally released onto the web, some questionnaires and experiments were conducted to evaluate the usability, precision, and efficiency of the system. The results of these evaluations indicated that the system provides an adaptive testing for different devices and supports versatile assessment functions. Moreover, the system can estimate students' ability reliably and validly and conduct an adaptive test efficiently. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the system was alleviated by the PSO approach. By the approach, the test item selection procedure becomes efficient and the average best fitness values are very close to the optimal solutions. (Contains 9 figures and 6 tables.)

AB  - This article discusses the growing interest in computer-adaptive testing, which supporters say can help guide instruction, increase student motivation, and determine the best use of resources for districts. This method of testing shortens the test by not asking high-achieving students questions that are too easy for them, and likewise not giving struggling students questions that are too hard. However, computer-adaptive assessments are not the best way to evaluate students in every situation, experts point out. Though, they recognize the potential of computer-adaptive testing, experts also voice caution in using this kind of method.

AB  - Item response theory is a modern test theory. It focuses on the performance of each item. Under this framework, the performance of test takers on a test item can be predicted by a set of abilities. The relationship between the test takers' item performances and the set of abilities underlying item performances can be described by a monotonically increasing function called an item characteristic curve. Due to various personal reasons, the performances of the test takers may depart from the response patterns predicted by the underlying test model. In order to calculate the extent of departure of these aberrant response patterns, a number of methods have been developed under the theme "person-fit statistics". The degree of aberration is calculated as an index called person-fit index. Inside the computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test takers with different abilities will answer different numbers of questions and the difficulties of the items administered to them are usually clustered at the abilities of the test takers. Due to this reason, the application of person-fit indices in the computerized adaptive testing environment to measure misfit is difficult. When the frequent accesses to the item bank has become feasible, test takers may memorize blocks of test items and share these items with future test takers. Individuals with prior knowledge of some items may use that information to get high scores, in the sense that their test scores have been artificially inflated. FLOR is an index of posterior log-odds ratio used for detecting the use of item pre-knowledge. It can be applied both in the fixed item, fixed length test and the CAT environment. It is a model-based index in which aberrant models are defined in the situation of item pre-knowledge. FLOR describes the likelihood that a response pattern arises from the aberrant models. The present study used the hf plot to access the sensitivity of the person-fit indices. hf plot is a plot of hit rate against false alarm rate. For a higher hit rate, usually a higher false alarm rate is followed. hf plot provides a good tools for comparison between indices by inspection of the speed of rise of the curves. A sensitive index should give a faster rise of the curve. In this study, sensitivity of an index was defined as the speed of rise of the hf plot, which is represented by a parameter hf<cf><84> estimated from the data obtained from hf plot. The present study assessed the stability of FLOR over other variables, which were unrelated to item pre-knowledge. It found that FLOR was stable over the discrimination and difficulty parameters of test items. It was also stable over positions of the exposed items in the test and the initial assignment of prior probability of item pre-knowledge. However, the asymptotes (guessing factor) and the probabilities of item exposure did affect the final values of FLOR seriously. The present study also found that FLOR has a much superior sensitivity over other indices in detecting item pre-knowledge. Concerning about the sensitivity over different abilities of test takers, it was found that the sensitivity of FLOR was the highest among low ability test takers and the weakest among strong ability test takers in the fixed length and fixed items tests. However, the sensitivities of FLOR became the same among different abilities of test takers if items with difficulties matching their abilities were used in the tests. The number of beneficiaries among the test takers did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR. Moreover, in a simulation to test the differentiating power of FLOR, it was found that FLOR could differentiate item pre-knowledge from other reasons of personal misfits (test anxiety, player, random response and challenger) effectively. After the stability and sensitivity of FLOR were investigated, the application of it in the CAT environment had become the main concern. The present studies found that both the test length and the number of exposed items affect the final value of FLOR. In the fixed length CAT, the FLOR has a much stronger sensitivity than lz and CUSUM in detecting item pre-knowledge. The sensitivity of FLOR in the fixed length CAT was the same as that in the fixed length fixed items test. If the test length could vary, the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT would be slightly weakened. The Adjusted FLOR index could increase the sensitivity. Concerning about the effect of ability on the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT, it was found that the abilities of the test takers in CAT did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR and Adjusted FLOR.

Number of misfitting items, generating &thetas;, item selection method, and &thetas; estimation method were independent variables in this study. It was found that CAT could recover from misfit-as-correct-responses for low ability simulees given a sufficient number of items. CAT could not recover from misfit-as-incorrect-responses for high ability simulees. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research were provided.

AB  - In a randomized experiment (n = 515), a computerized and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) are compared. The item pool consists of 24 polytomous motivation items. Although items are carefully selected, calibration data show that Samejima's graded response model did not fit the data optimally. A simulation study is done to assess possible consequences of model misfit. CAT efficiency was studied by a systematic comparison of the CAT with two types of conventional fixed length short forms, which are created to be good CAT competitors. Results showed no essential administration mode effects. Efficiency analyses show that CAT outperformed the short forms in almost all aspects when results are aggregated along the latent trait scale. The real and the simulated data results are very similar, which indicate that the real data results are not affected by model misfit. (Contains 2 tables, 6 figures and 5 notes.)

CY  - United States -- South Dakota
AB  - SouthDakotaView (SDView) is a program funded by the United States Geological Survey that provides satellite remote sensing imagery for a variety of applications, including education; however, an educational tool that utilizes the SDView imagery has yet not been developed. In particular, there is presently no easy way for students to make use of the SDView satellite imagery in learning elementary geography. An image map viewer could be useful for K-12 students to understand the relationship between image data and geographic information. A web-based intelligent tutoring system has been used in many educational systems as an efficient way to deliver educational material. In an intelligent tutoring system, an adaptive testing scheme can be employed to accurately evaluate a student's knowledge level by utilizing a test. Therefore, we focus on developing a web-based intelligent tutoring system for elementary geography students using an adaptive testing scheme. In this thesis, a prototype system, called SD-ITS, has been developed for a web-based geographic learning system. The prototype system is focused on applying an adaptive testing scheme and making an interactive image map for the intelligent tutoring system. This thesis demonstrates that the prototype system, SD-ITS, controls the student's test progress and has the ability to provide appropriate level of tutoring information from SDView or other archives for the students. This system adaptively adjusts the geography testing for each student on the basis of his/her knowledge level. In addition, an interactive image map application provides tutoring information that helps the students comprehend the real geographic information. In this thesis, the prototype system aims to motivate elementary students to learn more geography information through adaptive testing and an interactive geography maps for tutoring purpose.

TI  - An investigation of stratification exposure control procedures in CATs using the generalized partial credit model

AB  - The a-stratification procedure of item exposure control was designed to stratify items by item discrimination to ensure that an adaptive test would administer items from the entire range of items, not just the most-informative ones. An improvement to the a-stratification method, the a-stratification with b-blocking procedure added stratification according to item difficulty in order to take into account any correlation that might exist within the item pool between item discrimination and item difficulty. These procedures have been shown to work well using dichotomous items. This dissertation explored both stratification procedures using polytomous item pools to investigate whether or not an optimum number of strata could be implemented when administering polytomous computerized adaptive tests. In addition to the stratification procedures, two other exposure control conditions were studied. The randomesque procedure was used in one condition while a no exposure control condition served as a baseline condition. Items calibrated according to the generalized partial credit model were used to construct two item pools. Since the items covered three areas of science, content balancing procedures were incorporated to ensure that each adaptive test provided the appropriate balance of content. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate ability levels from simulated CATs. The number of strata used with both stratification procedures ranged from two to five, to ensure enough items per stratum. Along with descriptive statistics and correlations, bias and root mean squared error helped portray the accuracy of the simulated tests. Item exposure and item pool usage rates were used to show how much of the item pools were being used across administrations of the tests. Finally, item overlap rates were calculated to show how many of the same items were being used among simulated examinees of similar and different abilities. The results of this study did not reveal an optimum number of strata for the stratification procedures with either item pool. Furthermore, the randomesque procedure outperformed the stratification procedures in terms of item exposure and item overlap rates for both item pools. This surprising result was not affected by the number of strata used within the stratification procedures.

AB  - The initiation of wellbore failure and subsequent production of sand to the surface in petroleum reservoirs has often been associated with an increase in water cut.<c2><a0> Published field-level studies and experimental results do not provide a definite correlation between these two events - sand production and water breakthrough.<c2><a0> The experimental work described in this thesis aims to quantify the changes in the strength of weakly cemented and unconsolidated sand samples due to changes in fluid saturations.<c2><a0> This thesis addresses the reasons for the observed strength differences using unconsolidated and weakly cemented samples made of pure quartz, and different pore fluids (air, water and oil). Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) tests, Thick Wall Cylinder (TWC) strength tests and multistage tests were carried out at various saturation conditions.Â  A 3-D correlation between UCS, porosity and water saturation was recorded and the results were compared with theoretical predictions.Â  The initial failure and collapse strengths for partially saturated, unconsolidated TWC samples were approximately 7 and 37 times their UCS values of approximately 6 kPa.Â  The failure envelope for oil-saturated samples was weaker than water-saturated samples in multistage tests.Â  Suction controlled tests at avoids conditions did not show a systematic increase in shear strengths with increasing suction. The strength of weak and unconsolidated pure sand is shown to be not appreciably affected by changes in water saturation.Â  The loss of cementation and lubricating effect of pore fluids leads to reduced strength.Â  A common failure model based on suction alone is not recommended in predicting wellbore failure for all types of materials.

AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) assumes that state-mandated tests provide useful information to school administrators and teachers. However, interviews with administrators and teachers suggest that Minnesota's tests, which are representative of the current generation of state-mandated tests, fail to provide useful information to administrators and teachers about areas that need attention. The use of a single level of difficulty causes harmful stress and provides measurements of poor quality for many students. Computer-adaptive tests are a practical alternative, provide more useful information, reduce stress among students, and address four major concerns that teachers have about testing. This alternative could strengthen the link between testing and improved educational outcomes and improve the chances that NCLB will have a positive impact. However, current federal policy prohibits the use of computer-adaptive tests for accountability purposes. This article provides specific recommendations that potentially could address four critical concerns about current state-mandated tests. (Contains 1 figure, 1 table, and 6 notes.)

TI  - Measurement of Korean EFL college students' foreign language classroom speaking anxiety: Evidence of psychometric properties and accuracy of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) with dichotomously scored items using a CAT simulation

AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

AB  - With the development and maturation of computer technology and test theories, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become more widely used in educational assessment. Most CATS systems are based on item response theory (IRT), and as compared with traditional paper and pencil tests (P & P test), CAT selects the most suitable items according to individual examinee's ability. Thus, it provides a more accurate and efficient estimate of examinees' ability. Along with the development of the society and the rising education for the general public, there is stronger demand that educational tests should not only be used to rank and screen examinees, but also to provide diagnostic information about students' misconceptions. Researchers have proposed different models to establish these diagnostic tests, through which we can estimate examinees' knowledge ability or psychological traits from their item responses. Among these models, the Rule Space Model (RSM) is an influential one and has been implemented in the analysis and reporting of the PSAT (Preliminary SAT Test) for high school leavers in the United States of America. Incorporating RSM into CAT will lead to a totally new testing system<e2><80><94>the diagnostic computerized adaptive test. However, we have little knowledge on the characteristics of the model in its ability estimation efficiency, its new item selection strategy, and stopping rule, among other things. The present research aimed to understand these characteristics. Broadly differentiated, there were two main research purposes. Firstly, the research aimed to understand in greater depth the properties of the RSM, including, such as, how estimation accuracy would be affected by different factors (e.g. test length). Secondly, in the incorporation of RSM in diagnostic computerized adaptive tests, the performances of four different item selection methods were compared. These two purposes were achieved through two related sets of studies. The first set of experiments consisted of seven simulation experiments to investigate factors affecting the performance of the RSM. These factors being examined include: test length, number of attributes in the test, hierarchical relations among attributes, nature (simple versus complicated) of items used, item guessing or slipness parameter, and item response model (one- versus three-parameter model) used in item bank. The second set of experiments compared four item selection strategies in diagnostic CAT, with random selection method as borderline method. In order to calculate and compare the accuracy of examinees' attribute estimation, the Monte Carlo simulation method was used in both sets of studies. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

PY  - 2001
PB  - University of Massachusetts Amherst
CY  - United States -- Massachusetts
AB  - The advantages that computer adaptive testing offers over linear tests have been well documented. The Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) design is more efficient than the Linear test design as fewer items are needed to estimate an examinee's proficiency to a desired level of precision. In the ideal situation, a CAT will result in examinees answering different number of items according to the stopping rule employed. Unfortunately, the realities of testing conditions have necessitated the imposition of time and minimum test length limits on CATs. Such constraints might place a burden on the CAT test taker resulting in aberrant response behaviors by some examinees. Occurrence of such response patterns results in inaccurate estimation of examinee proficiency levels. This study examined the effects of test lengths, time limits and the interaction of these factors with the examinee proficiency levels on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns. The focus of the study was on the aberrant behaviors caused by rushed guessing due to restrictive time limits. Four different testing scenarios were examined; fixed length performance tests with and without content constraints, fixed length mastery tests and variable length mastery tests without content constraints. For each of these testing scenarios, the effect of two test lengths, five different timing conditions and the interaction between these factors with three ability levels on ability estimation were examined. For fixed and variable length mastery tests, decision accuracy was also looked at in addition to the estimation accuracy. Several indices were used to evaluate the estimation and decision accuracy for different testing conditions. The results showed that changing time limits had a significant impact on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns conditional on ability. Increasing test length had negligible if not negative effect on ability estimation when rushed guessing occured. In case of performance testing high ability examinees while in classification testing middle ability examinees suffered the most. The decision accuracy was considerably affected in case of variable length classification tests.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of the Sympson and Hetter conditional procedure (SHC), a modification of the Sympson and Hetter (1985) algorithm, in controlling the exposure rates of items in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment. The properties of the procedure were compared with those of the Davey and Parshall (1995) and the Stocking and Lewis (1995) (SLC) conditional multinomial procedures within the purview of estimating examinee's abilities. Each of the exposure control methods was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed based on the CAT design established for this study. The advantages and disadvantages of these strategies were considered under four item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of test security, test overlap rates, utilization of the item pool, and conditional standard errors of measurement. Also, the issue of the appropriate conditional sample sizes in deriving the exposure control parameters was considered in the present study. Simulation results show no effect of using the four conditional sample sizes. The SHC produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates followed by the SLC method. Results also show that as long as the control for item exposure was not exercised, optimal items could be administered to almost every examinee under any of the four item pools. Findings of this study provide useful insights on how item pool sizes and maximum item exposure rates affect the performance of the exposure control methods.

WLE was compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), expected a posteriori (EAP), and maximum a posteriori (MAP) using a three-dimensional 3PL IRT model under a variety of computerized adaptive testing conditions. The dependent variables included bias, standard error of ability estimates (SE), square root of mean square error (RMSE), and test information. The independent variables were ability estimation methods, intercorrelation levels between dimensions, multidimensional structures, and ability combinations. Simulation results were presented in terms of descriptive statistics, such as figures and tables. In addition, inferential procedures were used to analyze bias by conceptualizing this Monte Carlo study as a statistical sampling experiment. The results of this study indicate that WLE and the other three estimation methods yield significantly more accurate ability estimates under an approximate simple test structure with one dominant dimension and several secondary dimensions. All four estimation methods, especially WLE, yield very large SEs when a three equally dominant multidimensional structure was employed. Consistent with previous findings based on unidimensional IRT model, MLE and WLE are less biased in the extreme of the ability scale; MLE and WLE yield larger SEs than the Bayesian methods; test information-based SEs underestimate actual SEs for both MLE and WLE in MCAT situations, especially at shorter test lengths; WLE reduced the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure; test information-based SEs underestimates the actual SEs of MLE and WLE estimators in the MCAT conditions, similar to the findings of Warm (1989) in the unidimensional case. The results from the MCAT simulations did show some advantages of WLE in reducing the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure with a fixed test length of 50 items, which was consistent with the previous research findings based on different unidimensional models. It is clear from the current results that all four methods perform very poorly when the multidimensional structures with multiple dominant factors were employed. More research efforts are urged to investigate systematically how different multidimensional structures affect the accuracy and reliability of ability estimation. Based on the simulated results in this study, there is no significant effect found on the ability estimation from the intercorrelation between dimensions.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that, when administered a self-adapted test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a self-adapted test--lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT)--can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted self-adapted test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only in the region of their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class. The results show that while the RS-AT effectively controlled the standard errors of proficiency estimation, examinees receiving an RS-AT did not show higher mean proficiency or lower posttest state anxiety than examinees receiving a CAT.

AB  - This dissertation is concerned with item banks, more specifically, with the construction of them. Item banks are an essential piece in adaptive strategies of testing, as they are the item source for this kind of tests, the place from where the item(s) to be administered at each moment are selected. However, item bank development appears as a complex task that could be the reason of a reduced number of available item banks and, consequently, a limited application of adaptive tests in practice. These precedents have motivated the main goal of this dissertation: the development of a tool, that taking profit of computing power, supports the process of development and management of item banks. With it, it has been tried to do the development of item banks more efficient and, consequently, more accessible the renowned computerized adaptive tests. The main contribution of this work to satisfy this goal has come through the in-depth review of the whole process of building an item bank and the analysis of requirements of a program oriented to give support to the item bank development process. This program is referred in the thesis as BANKIT. With the former review emerged the meaning and implications of the different tasks involved in the building of item banks as well as the relationship between them, which has allowed to make clear what should be satisfied with BANKIT and set up the basis for the latter analysis. Available software, needs, tasks, attributes, data and functional analysis have made up the requirement analysis of this computerized system.

TI  - The effect of individual differences variables on the assessment of ability for computerized adaptive testing
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

PY  - 1996
PB  - Northwestern University
CY  - United States -- Illinois
AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) continues to gain momentum as the accepted testing modality for a growing number of certification, licensure, education, government and human resource applications. However, the developers of these tests have for the most part failed to adequately explore the impact of individual differences such as test anxiety on the adaptive testing process. It is widely accepted that non-cognitive individual differences variables interact with the assessment of ability when using written examinations. Logic would dictate that individual differences variables would equally affect CAT. Two studies were used to explore this premise. In the first study, 507 examinees were given a test anxiety survey prior to taking a high stakes certification exam using CAT or using a written format. All examinees had already completed their course of study, and the examination would be their last hurdle prior to being awarded certification. High test anxious examinees performed worse than their low anxious counterparts on both testing formats. The second study replicated the finding that anxiety depresses performance in CAT. It also addressed the differential effect of anxiety on within test performance. Examinees were candidates taking their final certification examination following a four year college program. Ability measures were calculated for each successive part of the test for 923 subjects. Within subject performance varied depending upon test position. High anxious examinees performed poorly at all points in the test, while low and medium anxious examinee performance peaked in the middle of the test. If test anxiety and performance measures were actually the same trait, then low anxious individuals should have performed equally well throughout the test. The observed interaction of test anxiety and time on task serves as strong evidence that test anxiety has motivationally mediated as well as cognitively mediated effects. The results of the studies are discussed relative to the need for CAT developers to consider individual differences variables such as test anxiety when constructing their tests.

AB  - Two types of computerized testing have been defined: (1) computer-based testing, using a computer to administer conventional tests in which all examinees take the same set of items; and (2) adaptive tests, in which items are selected for administration by the computer, based on examinee's previous responses. This paper discusses an option for classroom teachers that is easier to develop than a computerized adaptive test, but more secure and sophisticated than a computer-based test. The process of developing and pilot testing the computer-administered test and the results of a survey of student reactions are described. Subjects for the study consisted of 108 undergraduates taking summer educational technology courses in computer applications at a Southern university. Identical items were used for paper-and-pencil and computerized tests. No significant differences were found for either administration. Student responses indicated that: all of the students had familiarity with computers; 94% had no problems understanding the test directions; 53% initially experienced anxiety about taking the test on a computer; 89% indicated that the computer test was as fair as a paper test; and 61% indicated a preference for the computer test, while 19% indicated that both methods worked equally well. Four tables depict results for computerized tests versus paper-and-pencil tests; descriptive data for both kinds of tests; students' yes/no responses to the attitude survey; and examinee's comments regarding computerized testing.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Korean college students (n=208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (motivated and non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) under the counterbalanced design at the computer laboratory. They were also given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale, a 10-item computer test anxiety scale, and a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing. A multivariate analysis of covariance, with the math aptitude and the test anxiety as covariates, demonstrated that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes.

CY  - United States -- Pennsylvania
AB  - The benefits of adaptive testing, reduced test length and increased measurement precision, are in part achieved through the application of a maximum-information item selection algorithm. While such an algorithm is an effective means for tailoring the difficulty of adaptive tests to examinee ability, its use with multidimensional content domains might result in examinations that lack content validity. Licensure and certification examinations typically assess knowledge of multidimensional content domains. As such, balancing test content is an important consideration for these types of tests. This study investigated the effects of content balancing on an adaptive licensure and certification examination. A computer simulation was used with data distributions attained from previous administrations of a conventional test. The performance of the adaptive test was examined under four content-balancing methods and fifteen stopping rules. The results showed that employing a rigorous content-balancing method had no significant adverse effect on the efficiency or accuracy of the adaptive test under study. Findings, also indicated that ability estimation bias contributed to slight inaccuracies in the determination of the passing status for examinees whose abilities were near the minimum passing ability. The findings of this study support the use of adaptive testing for licensure and certification examinations under the following conditions: rigorous content balancing is employed, the item bank contains a sufficient number of items to optimally measure a range of abilities, and if estimation bias is found to affect the pass/fail decision, it is corrected. Implications of these findings are discussed for school certification testing.

AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance. Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables. This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance. The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between examinee achievement-specific locus of control and the differences between self-adapted testing (SAT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in terms of mean estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. Subjects were 379 college students. A disordinal interaction was found between test type and locus of control. Examinees with an internal locus of control were affected positively by the SAT (relative to the CAT). For examinees with an external locus of control, however, the SAT appeared to have a negative effect on both estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. There are four tables and two figures.

AB  - The aim of this thesis is to develop realistic expectations about the psychological and psychometric implications of using computerized adaptive tests (CAT). A review is carried out of literature on computerized-based testing (CBT) and CAT. A field study as well as four laboratory experiments were conducted to achieve that goal. The current research strongly suggested the equivalence between the P& P and CAT formats for the Abstract Reasoning (AR) and Mechanical Reasoning (MR) tests of the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), but failed to do so for the Numerical Ability (NA) test. Also, the CAT version of DAT can predict a performance variable as accurately as can the P& P format. Overall, testees' attitudes toward several aspects of computerized testing were positive. The results confirmed the negative relationship between computer experience and computer anxiety. Moreover, knowledge of CAT behaviour negatively affected subjects' performance, but did not increase the level of their state anxiety. This suggested that a form of feedback acts during the adaptive test which has a negative effect on testees' performance and response time. This assumption was confirmed. Subjects spend a shorter time on the subsequent item after negative feedback (wrong) on the previous item than after positive feedback (right). It has been found that although the response time for answering an individual item was higher for CAT format than for P& P format, the CAT version of DAT resulted in a 20% reduction in completion time of the test. Also, the difficulty level of the initial items has a significant effect on testees' overall scores. The findings of this thesis suggest that CAT has numerous advantages and potential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of testing, and has potential areas of future contribution within personnel selection and assessment. This potential can be realized if proper consideration is made in designing, developing, and implementing these testing systems, and if professional standards are maintained by developers and users.

The strongest preference for SAT was seen in individuals with the highest mathematics anxiety. (SLD)

AB  - This study was designed to help educators evaluate the desirability of computer adaptive testing compared to nonadaptive paper/pencil testing for middle school students and teachers. Computer adaptive testing uses computers for test administration, selection of items, scoring, and reporting. The study examined three aspects of computer adaptive testing: (1) student attitudes concerning computer testing; (2) student factors (e.g., gender) affecting student attitudes; and (3) teacher perceptions about its strengths and weaknesses. The study examined the relationships between student factors (gender, race/ethnicity, math ability level, math test performance, grade, and computer usage) and student attitudes concerning computer adaptive testing. Three aspects of student attitudes were examined: ease with the method, comfort with equipment, and preference for computer adaptive testing. The sample consisted of 343 students and 6 teachers from one middle school in a mid-Atlantic school district. The students took two versions of a functional mathematics test--paper/pencil and computer adaptive--and a 14 item survey assessing their attitudes about the test. The teachers participated in a survey and interview. The results of the study indicate that a majority of the students and teachers support computer adaptive testing. With regards to students, a majority reported positive reactions in areas such as preference for computer testing as opposed to paper/pencil testing, clarity of directions and graphics, and ease of reading from the screen. However, a majority of students also reported that they were bothered by their inability to review and change answers. In addition, accelerated and remedial ability level students were more concerned with some aspects of computer adaptive testing than average ability level students. Differential results for the factors of gender and math achievement were also found. With regards to teachers, positive comments focused on the shorter time needed for testing, convenience of using computer technology for testing, and immediate scoring information. Although the study shows strong student and teacher support for the use of this new testing methodology, several important issues should be addressed especially for remedial and accelerated ability level students.

AB  - Research on the major computerized adaptive testing (CAT) strategies is reviewed, and some findings are reported that examine effects of examinee demographic and psychological characteristics on CAT strategies. In fixed branching strategies, all examinees respond to a common routing test, the score of which is used to assign examinees to a second-stage test. The currently popular statistically branched adaptive strategies are based on item-response theory, and include maximum likelihood strategy and Bayesian strategy. Two alternative strategies are the use of self-adapted testing and testlet strategies. Examinee characteristic variables are divided into: (1) demographic variables; (2) computer-use variables; (3) test-taking strategy variables; (4) cognitive characteristics; and (5) affective characteristics. Although research on the relationship between examinee psychological characteristics and CAT has been inconclusive, the basic findings are that examinees of different ethnic, gender, age, grade, ability, academic self-concept, test anxiety, computer anxiety, math anxiety, and computer experience groups are differentially affected by the adaptive testing strategies. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (Contains 67 references.) (SLD)

AB  - A new testing strategy that provides protection against the problem of having examinees in adaptive testing choose difficulty levels that are not matched to their proficiency levels was introduced and evaluated. The method, termed restricted self-adapted testing (RSAT), still provides examinees with a degree of control over the difficulty levels of their test items. The range of item choice is restricted to a region around the examinee's current proficiency estimate. Participants in this study were 186 students in grades 3 through 8 in the Portland (Oregon) Public School system during the winter of 1992-93, who were tested as part of an ongoing computerized adaptive testing program. Students were randomly assigned to a computerized adaptive test (CAT), a self-adaptive test (SADT), or RSAT in mathematics. Results indicate no differences between CAT and SADT conditions in terms of mean proficiency and mean posttest state anxiety. The basic RSAT method appears to hold promise for providing examinees with control over the testing situation, while preventing large mismatches between item difficulty choice and proficiency level. The RSAT procedure should be evaluated empirically. (SLD)

AB  - This study assessed whether providing examinees with a choice between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and self-adaptive testing (SAT) affects test performance in comparison with being assigned a CAT or SAT, and evaluated variables influencing examinee choice of either test form. The relative influences of test type and test choice on examinee anxiety were also examined. Subjects were 244 undergraduate and 133 graduate students from a large midwestern university. Students were randomly assigned to SAT, CAT, and choice conditions for an algebra test. Test-related anxiety was assessed with a paper-and-pencil measure in pretests and posttests. It was found that, for students with high mathematics anxiety, providing a choice between CAT and SAT led to significantly higher mean proficiency estimates, lending support to the hypothesis that examinees can cope with a stressful situation more effectively if they feel that they have some control over the source of the stress. Expected differences in estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety between CAT and SAT conditions were not found, but a strong relationship was seen between examinee test type choice and mathematics anxiety level. Higher anxiety examinees have a greater preference for the control provided by SAT. Six tables and two graphs summarize findings. (SLD)

AB  - Advances in the application of item response theory and the availability of powerful microcomputers have made computerized adaptive testing (CAT) a reality. Two issues that need to be considered before large-scale applications of computerized adaptive tests are (1) reliability of CAT scores, and (2) their susceptibility to factors that contaminate test scores. Testwiseness has been shown to have a significant effect on P&P scores. The effects of TW on CAT scores have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of TW on CAT and P&P tests. Reliability of a CAT and a P&P version of a test was also compared. Subjects were 120 students at a large university. Half received TW training as part of their course content; half received no TW training. Subjects were randomly assigned to take a CAT or a P&P math test. They were tested again on the same test after three weeks. They also responded to a questionnaire about their attitudes toward the test and TW strategies they had used. It was hypothesized that TW training would be more effective in improving P&P test scores than CAT scores. Contrary to expectations, results showed no significant effects for TW training. There is evidence to suggest that the group without TW training may have been more testwise than the TW training group initially. Mode effects were significant for test scores (higher on P&P than on CAT) and for attitudes toward the test (more positive toward CAT). Correlation between the two sets of CAT scores was low (.29). Test-retest reliability was high (.81) for the P&P test. The low reliability of CAT in this study may be attributed to the inappropriateness of the difficulty level of the test for the subjects, inconsistencies in subjects' responses due to lack of motivation, and termination of the test at ability estimates greater than 4 or smaller than $-$4. It is suggested that with increased usage of CATs, new test-taking strategies may emerge that are only relevant to the CAT.

AB  - Optimal test design involves the application of an item selection heuristic to construct a test to fit the target information function in order that the standard error of the test can be controlled at different regions of the ability continuum. The real data simulation study assessed the efficiency of binary programming in optimal item selection by comparing the degree in which the obtained test information was approximated to different target information functions with a manual heuristic. The effects of imposing a content balancing constraint was studied in conventional, two-stage and adaptive tests designed using the automated procedure. Results showed that the automated procedure improved upon the manual procedure significantly when a uniform target information function was used. However, when a peaked target information function was used, the improvement over the manual procedure was marginal. Both procedures were affected by the distribution of the item parameters in the item pool. The degree in which the examinee empirical scores were recovered was lower when a content balancing constraint was imposed in the conventional test designs. The effect of uneven item parameter distribution in the item pool was shown by the poorer recovery of the empirical scores at the higher regions of the ability continuum. Two-stage tests were shown to limit the effects of content balancing. Content balanced adaptive tests using optimal item selection was shown to be efficient in empirical score recovery, especially in maintaining equiprecision in measurement over a wide ability range despite the imposition of content balancing constraint in the test design. The study had implications for implementing automated test designs in the school systems supported by hardware and expertise in measurement theory and addresses the issue of content balancing using optimal test designs within an adaptive testing framework.

AB  - Purpose of study. This study was to determine if nursing candidates for licensure experienced an increase in anxiety due to the administration of an examination by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second purpose was to discover if certain groups were "at risk" of experiencing computer test anxiety. Method. This study was a two-group, experimental design conducted concurrently with the CAT-NCLEX simulation. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing selected practical nursing graduates and repeat examinees to participate in a field test of the Computerized Adaptive Testing of the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The experimental group for this study participated in the CAT simulation activity prior to taking NCLEX-PN and the control group did so after NCLEX-PN. Both groups completed a 17 item Self-Report Anxiety Questionnaire. The responses were summed; the total score was considered to be a measure of anxiety. Findings. Analysis of the data indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in computer test anxiety between the two groups. This is not to infer that there was no computer test anxiety expressed but rather that there was virtually no difference in the level of anxiety reported by the experimental group and the control group. Further analysis of data indicated that persons with previous computer experience reported higher levels of computer test anxiety than those without previous computer experience and that females reported themselves as experiencing higher levels of computer test anxiety than did males. The results did not indicate that minorities experienced higher levels of computer test anxiety than non-minority groups. Lastly, there was no correlation between nursing grade point average or age and levels of computer test anxiety. Conclusion. Participation in a computerized testing simulation did not affect the level of computer test anxiety. The only groups to experience higher levels of computer test anxiety are females and those with previous computer experience.

AB  - Little research exists on the psychological impacts of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and how it may affect test performance. Three CAT procedures were examined, in which items were selected to match students' achievement levels, from the item pool at random, or according to student choice of item difficulty levels. Twenty-four graduate students (5 males and 19 females) at Indiana University (Richmond) were randomly assigned to one of six testing orders formed by the three mastery test approaches and by blocking on native and non-native speakers. While at a computer, students received a description of adaptive testing methods and then a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. Right after completing each test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale, ranked their preferences among tests, and evaluated their performance on each of the tests. No statistically significant mean differences were found among mean student achievement scores or among in-test anxiety means under the three adaptive testing methods. Students reporting higher anxiety scored significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Those preferring the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most were less anxious during those tests. Instead of actual performance, students' perceptions of how well they did were significantly correlated with preference rankings for the tests. The matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach decisions than did the random-selection tests. Ten tables, 1 figure, and a 19-item list of references are included.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to develop, implement, and evaluate the year long project, Microcomputer Adaptive Testing High-Risk Urban Students (MATH-R-US). The project produced diagnostic software to meet the following criteria: (1) help students obtain high school mathematics credit needed for graduation; (2) motivate students to learn mathematics; (3) account for erratic student attendance; and (4) use computer adaptive testing as an integral part of the program. The project was used for an entire school year by a class in an urban high school with an at-risk predominantly black population and a high rate of absenteeism. The tests, which accept generative responses rather than multiple choice answers, were administered once a week in the school's computer lab. The results of each test were saved and practice sheets, with answer keys, were generated for the missed objectives. The program was evaluated to improve implementation and furnish descriptive data to the classroom teachers and school administrators. It was found that the program generated intense student competition to see who could get the most hamburger graphics--which appeared on the screen when students completed a test with 100% accuracy--in an hour. Both males and female students expressed positive attitudes about the course components, but female responses reflected more confidence in their own abilities. Computer math test scores indicated a consistent improvement on retesting of a topic, with 23 perfect scores on 43 retests. A discussion of the implications of this study concludes the paper.

AB  - The strategies examinees employ when making item difficulty level choices in self-adapted computerized testing were investigated. Subjects were 148 college students (88 females and 60 males) in an introductory statistics course. The primary instrument was a self-adapted computerized algebra test used to measure student readiness for the statistics course. Each examinee was administered 20 items from a pool of 93. Students rated their self-efficacy before the test and were administered measures of mathematics anxiety and test anxiety. Inspection of each student's data file provided an indicator of selection strategy. Examinees who chose a more difficult first test item expressed greater capability and higher confidence, reported less anxiety just prior to testing, and less anxiety about mathematics in general. When selecting additional items, examinees tended toward what was termed a sluggishly flexible strategy; they chose more difficult items after passing an item or string of items, and chose less difficult items after failing a single item or string of items. The most frequent choice was to remain at the same level. Results indicate that self-adaptive testing may be a viable alternative to computerized adaptive testing. Two figures and two tables contain data from the study. (SLD)

AB  - The equivalence of pencil and paper Rasch item calibrations when used in a computer adaptive test administration was explored in this study. Items (n=726) were precalibarted with the pencil and paper test administrations. A computer adaptive test was administered to 321 medical technology students using the pencil and paper precalibrations in the item selection algorithms and in the computation of examinee ability estimates. The response data from the computer adaptive test administration were analyzed yielding recalibrated item difficulties and examinee ability estimates. Item precalibrations were compared with item recalibrations. Examinee ability estimates obtained using the item precalibrations on the computer adaptive administration were compared with the examinee ability estimates obtained from using the item recalibrations on the computer adaptive administration. The correlation for examinee ability estimates was 0.99 and for item correlations it was 0.90. Some item calibrations shifted but most remained consistent within the limits of error. Item shift, however, did not affect the ordering of examinee ability estimates. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 23 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection). Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited. No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore psychometric issues pertinent to application of an IRT-based response aberrancy detection statistic in the domain of personality measurement. Monte Carlo and real-data analyses were conducted to address several issues regarding the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ response aberrancy statistic. The major issues explored were characteristics of the null distribution of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic, and its power to identify aberrant response patterns. In addition, the consistency of examinee Z$\sb{\rm L}$ level across half-tests, and the recovery of Z$\sb{\rm L}$ at different adaptive test lengths was examined. There were four main results. First, the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ index null distribution was not well standaradized when item parameters of personality scales were used; the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ null distribution variance was significantly less than the hypothesized value of 1.0 under several conditions. Second, the power of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic to detect response aberrancy was affected by the scoring method. It appeared that detection power was optimal when a biweight estimator of $\theta$ was used. Third, examinee Z$\sb{\rm L}$ level was not consistent across half-tests. This result implied that response aberrancy is not a reliable person characteristic within a particular trait domain. Finally, identifying aberrant response patterns in an adaptive testing context was problematic. A major problem was that the null distribution of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic was not consistent across adaptive test lengths. In the discussion, several recommendations are made regarding proper implementation of response aberrancy statistics in personality measurement.

AB  - A nominal response model-based computerized adaptive testing procedure (nominal CAT) was implemented using simulated data. Ability estimates from the nominal CAT were compared to those from a CAT based upon the three-parameter logistic model (3PL CAT). Furthermore, estimates from both CAT procedures were compared with the known true abilities used to generate the simulated data. Results showed that the nominal CAT's ability estimates were highly correlated with those of the 3PL CAT as well as with the true abilities. Furthermore, the nominal CAT had a significantly higher association with negative true thetas than did the 3PL CAT, and it also had significantly lower standard errors of estimate than did the 3PL CAT. However, the nominal model-based CAT had difficulty estimating positive thetas and had a poor convergence rate. In contrast, the 3PL CAT had a high convergence rate and its performance was not affected by whether the true abilities were positive or negative. Potential reasons for the nominal CAT's high nonconvergence rate as well as implications for computerized adaptive testing were discussed. (Author)

AB  - Item Response Theory (IRT) is a relatively recent development in psychometrics that has emerged as an attractive alternative to classical test theory. This is primarily a result of IRT's potential for solving many long standing measurement problems. One important and very promising application of IRT is Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). CAT is a procedure for administering tests which are individually tailored for each examinee. A CAT system uses a particular IRT model in combination with test item characteristics to estimate the examinee's ability. To date, all implementations of CATs have been built on models which require dichotomous scoring of test items. For the purpose of ability estimation these systems do not differentiate between an examinee's incorrect answer and other incorrect alternatives. In contrast to the IRT models presently used in CAT implementations, the Nominal Response Model utilizes the information in the pattern of wrong responses for ability estimation. No assumptions are made about a particular response being more correct than another. A Nominal Response Model-based CAT (nominal CAT) was implemented using real and simulated data. Comparisons were made between the nominal CAT's ability estimates and those of a CAT based upon the three-parameter logistic model (3PL CAT). In addition, estimates from the nominal CAT were compared with the known true ability estimates used to generate the simulated data. Results showed that the nominal CAT's ability estimates were highly correlated with those of the 3PL CAT as well as with the true abilities. Furthermore, the nominal CAT had a significantly higher association with the negative true abilities than did the 3PL CAT and it also had significantly lower standard errors of estimate than did the 3PL CAT. However, the nominal CAT had difficulty estimating positive abilities and had a poor convergence rate. In contrast, the 3PL CAT has a high convergence rate and its performance was not affected by whether the true abilities were positive or negative. Implications for computerized adaptive testing were discussed.

CY  - United States -- Illinois
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an item response theory-based adaptive test of musical ability designed to overcome common shortcomings of commercially available musical ability tests. These shortcomings include test inefficiency, poor reliability and validity, ceiling effects, and examinee fatigue and boredom. Because of its suitability for item response theory-based techniques and its history in the music test field, tonal memory was chosen as the specific musical skill to be assessed. The research was conducted in three phases. The goal of the first phase was to develop item-prototypes for the adaptive test pool by determining combinations of instrumental timbre, rhythmic complexity, and tonality that provide unidimensional, unbiased and reasonably valid ability estimates. Four forms of a tonal memory test were administered to 125 college students. Results from a split-plot ANOVA of total test scores, a factor analysis of item clusters, and comparisons of test validity coefficients indicated that tonal and atonal items with synthesized timbre and varied rhythms were the most appropriate items to include in the adaptive test pool. The goal of the second phase was to select a final set of adaptive test items and assess their reliability and validity. One of three forms of a 104-item tonal memory test was administered to each of 336 high school and college students. Each form contained items matching the prototypes identified in the first phase. One hundred eighty items from phases one and two that provided good discrimination across all musical ability levels were chosen for the final adaptive test pool. Results indicated that scores based on the adaptive test items provided more reliable and valid ability estimates than two widely used conventional tests, the Seashore Tonal Memory Test and the Drake Musical Memory Test. The goal of the third phase was to assess the efficiency of the actual adaptive test by administering it to 20 examinees. An average of 6, 9 and 12 items was needed to obtain reliabilities of.80,.85, and.90 respectively. Taken as a whole these results provide compelling evidence that many shortcomings of conventional music tests can be overcome by adaptive tests. Adaptive testing appears to hold great promise for significantly improving the assessment of musical abilities. The development of adaptive tests of other musical skills is recommended.

CY  - Canada -- Manitoba, CA
AB  - Single stage and multistage pressuremeter creep tests have been conducted in large, laboratory-prepared samples of polycrystalline ice at temperatures of -2(DEGREES)C. One purpose of the experimental program was to investigate the validity and applicability of two creep theories, the widely used simple power law theory (strain-hardening formulation) and the recently proposed modified second-order fluid model. Another purpose was to investigate the relationship between single stage and multistage pressuremeter creep tests, in the same stress range, and thus to deduce the effect of loading history on the creep parameters. For both models, the creep information obtained from the multistage pressuremeter tests was found to compare very well with the information derived from single stage pressuremeter creep tests, both in terms of creep parameters and predicted long-term behaviour. The modified second-order fluid model, however, produced less scatter in the stress exponent n derived from the multistage tests than the simple power law model. Through analysis of the multistage tests, it appears that the past history of applied stresses in a pressuremeter creep test has little effect on the nature of the creep; rather, the amount of accumulated strain appears to be the controlling factor. For pressuremeter testing in ice or ice-rich frozen soils, it should be assumed that a steady-state creep condition will eventually prevail with continued straining. Each stress increment in a pressuremeter creep test should be applied until at least the steady-state condition is approached, as evidenced by a b (time exponent) of at least 0.90 or an exponentially increasing cavity radius with time. In order to attain the steady-state condition in a reasonable amount of time, a field multistage pressuremeter creep test may be started at any stress level. With carefully run calibrations both before and after each test, the OYO Elastmeter-100 pressuremeter with an electronic radius measuring device performed exceedingly well in this experimental program. Analysis of the results, for the time being, should be conducted in terms of the simple power law creep theory in its steady-state form. Because it can represent both primary and secondary creep in the same motion equation and is valid for large strains, the modified second-order fluid model is preferable to the simple power law model. Solutions to selected boundary-value problems, however, must be solved before it can be used in practice.

AB  - Computer adaptive testing systems are feasible for certification and licensure testing. This is in part due to the availability of extensive yet inexpensive computers. Modern item response theory, combined with computerized adaptive testing, yields a powerful new method of testing which provides greater accuracy and efficiency and less boredom for the examinee. The computer presents each item, scores it, and then selects the next item which is appropriate for the individual examinee; thus, individual testing is much more feasible than it would be using human examiners. There are additional advantages: acceptable accuracy can be achieved with fewer items; more accurate estimates can be obtained at the extreme ends of the ability continuum; test security is improved; tests can be administered on demand when needed; and a greater variety of item types may be included. With licensing and certification tests, it is important to obtain a good pool of test items, to be accurate near the minimum cutting score, to have appropriate unidimensionality, and to use computers in a comfortable environment. It is also useful to have a large number of examinees, approximately 1000 or more. Cost estimates are encouraging, especially when the computer systems are used often. (GDC)

AB  - During 1975-1979 this research into the potential of computerized adaptive testing to reduce errors in the measurement of human capabilities used Marine recruits for a live-testing validity comparison of computerized adaptive and conventional tests. The program purposes were to: (1) identify the most useful computer-based adaptive testing strategies; (2) identify testing conditions that maximize the positive rather than negative psychological effects of computerized testing; (3) investigate intra-individual multidimensionality problems in ability testing; (4) examine probabilistic responding and free-response methods for computerized adaptive testing in order to extract maximum information from each test item response; and (5) develop, refine and evaluate new computer administered ability tests for spacial, perceptive, memory, and other abilities not now measurable using paper and pencil testing. Monte Carlo and Bayesian adaptive testing methods were used in these studies. Fifteen major findings, primarily on adaptive testing and test administration conditions, and implications for further research are given. Abstracts of the 16 research reports for studies for this program are given. (BS)

AB  - Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate score bias and information characteristics of Owen's Bayesian adaptive testing strategy, and to examine possible causes of score bias. Factors investigated in three related studies included effects of item discrimination, effects of fixed vs. variable test length, and effects of an accurate prior theta estimate. Data were generated from a three-parameter logistic model for 3,100 simulees in each of eight data sets; Bayesian adaptive tests were administered, drawing items from a "perfect" item pool. The results indicate that theta estimates from Owen's Bayesian adaptive testing method are affected by the prior theta estimate used and that the method does not provide measurements that are unbiased and equiprecise except under the unrealistic condition of an accurate prior theta estimate.

AB  - Latent trait estimates derived from adaptive testing were evaluated as a function of item response theory model, scoring method, level of a,b item pool correlation, test length, and degree of item parameter error. 1700 simulated subjects were "administered" items from a pool of 150 items using maximum information adaptive item selection. Each simulee was tested under 100 combinations of conditions, with trait estimation precision evaluated using inaccuracy, bias, root mean square error, information, and fidelity. Results indicated little deterioration in trait estimates for realistic a, b, or c error. Very extreme b error alone or combined with other parameter error generated substantial deterioration for all models and test lengths. Shorter tests deteriorated most, and maximum likelihood (ML) scores deteriorated progressively more than Bayesian scores as item parameter error increased. r(a,b) level affected the results only at certain latent trait levels under very extreme b error. Bayesian and ML scores had equal fidelities, while ML scores excelled using information. The other indices suggested ML superiority for lesser item parameter error and Bayesian superiority as error increased. Less error was needed for Bayesian superiority under simpler models. The 2-parameter model was more precise that 1- or 3-parameter models for all but the bias index; its performance under considerable item parameter error equaled or exceeded the other two models with no item parameter error. Between-model differences were greater for Bayesian scoring, more extreme error conditions, shorter tests, and low or extreme trait values. Under extreme b error, differences varied widely but unsystematically with r(a,b). Level of r(a,b) had little or no systematic effect on precision, although precision and test length increased concomitantly. Per-item precision increments were greatest for the 1- and 3-parameter models and, at certain trait levels, for more extreme error conditions. Results suggest that latent trait estimates are robust to item parameter error, that interrelationships among variables are important considerations in adaptive testing design decisions, and that free response items should be more seriously considered.

AB  - The present monte carlo simulation study was designed to examine the effects of multidimensionality during the administration of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). It was assumed that multidimensionality existed in the individuals to whom test items were being administered, i.e., that the correct or incorrect responses given by an individual were generated from a specified multidimensional structure, rather than the unidimensional item response theory (IRT) model normally assumed to have generated the observable dichotomous test item responses. The dichotomous response was then treated for CAT item selection and ability estimation purposes as if it had been generated by the unidimensional model. To the extent that the observed item response was affected by dimensions other than the first (which corresponded to the single dimension assumed to underlie the item selection and ability estimation process) errors should be introduced into the adaptive testing process. These errors should affect the ability estimates and the efficiency of CAT. The study focused on the nature and degree of these errors under a variety of multidimensional structures, to determine how robust CAT is to the effects of multidimensionality in examinees' responses to test items.

AB  - The differences in types of information-processing skills developed by different instructional backgrounds affect, negatively or positively, the learning of further advanced instructional materials. If prior and subsequent instructional methods are different, a proactive inhibition effect produces low achievement scores on a post test. This poses a serious problem for routing of students to an instructional level on the sole basis of performance on a diagnostic adaptive test and makes it essential to determine what information-processing strategy was used and consider this knowledge simultaneously. Response time often provides supplementary information which differentiates among individuals showing identical quality of performance. A model that reflects this kind of information, obtainable from response time scores, is formulated in a similar manner to latent trait theory. This model is useful in identifying discriminating items that are sensitive to differences in instructional method. It also is helpful in identifying an individual's instructional background to a certain extent. (Author/CTM)

AB  - A situation in which computer-assisted instruction was combined with teacher-taught classes and computerized diagnostic adaptive testing was examined. The computerized diagnostic adaptive test for pre-algebra signed-number lessons was programmed along with a computer-managed routing system by which examinees were sent to the instructional unit corresponding to the skill level at which they stopped in the initial test. Upon completing the course a computerized conventional post test was administered. It was found that results differed markedly from results obtained in a previous study. A cluster analysis was performed on the response patterns of the skills, and four different groups were found. A discriminant analysis indicated significant differences among the four groups in response patterns of the skills in signed number operations. It was determined that differences between prior and current instructional methods confused students and caused confusion in the post-test data, and that the scoring procedure of the adaptive testing was not sensitive to individual differences in information processing skills which were affected by the instructional method used in previous teaching. It was concluded that reliance should not be placed solely on test results determined by performance scores on a diagnostic pretest. (Author/CTM)

AB  - This report examines how selection fairness is influenced by the characteristics of a selection instrument in terms of its distribution of item difficulties, level of item discrimination, degree of item bias, and testing strategy. Computer simulation was used in the administration of either a conventional or Bayesian adaptive ability test to a hypothetical target population consisting of a minority and majority subgroup. Fairness was evaluated by three indices which reflect the degree of differential validity, errors in prediction (Cleary's model), and proportion of applicants exceeding a selection cutoff (Thorndike's model). Major findings are: (1) when used in conjunction with either the Bayesian or conventional test, differential prediction increased fairness and facilitated the interpretation of the fairness indices; (2) the Bayesian adaptive tests were consistently fairer than the conventional tests for all item pools above the alpha=.7 discrimination level for tests of more than 30 items; (3) the differential prediction version of the Bayesian adaptive test produced almost perfectly fair performance on all fairness indices at high discrimination levels; and (4) the placement of subgroup prior distribution in the Bayesian adaptive testing procedure can affect test fairness.

AB  - TAILOR is a computer program that uses the implied orders concept as the basis for computerized adaptive testing. The basic characteristics of TAILOR, which does not involve pretesting, are reviewed here and two studies of it are reported. One is a Monte Carlo simulation based on the four-parameter Birnbaum model and the other uses a matrix of children's item responses to the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. In the Birnbaum model study, a variety of conditions were simulated; it was found that TAILOR typically used responses to about half the items and achieved validities with the true score within a few points of the validity of the complete test. Item discrimination parameters affected the efficiency of TAILOR. The Binet study used correlations between scores based on one bank of tailored items and another independent, parallel set and found results similar to those in the Birnbaum simulation. TAILOR, like other adaptive testing systems, apparently can aid efficiency when item discriminations are high or when ability variance is large. (Author/MV)

AB  - The effects of providing immediate knowledge of results (KR) and adaptive testing on test anxiety and test-taking motivation were investigated. Also studied was the accuracy of student perceptions of the difficulty of adaptive and conventional tests administered with or without immediate knowledge of results. Testees were 350 college students divided into high- and low-ability groups and randomly assigned to one of four test strategies by KR conditions. The ability level of examinees was found to be related to their reported levels of motivation and to differences in reported motivation under the different testing conditions. These results suggest that adaptive testing creates a psychological environment for testing which is more equivalently motivating for examinees of all ability levels and results in a greater standardization of the test-taking environment, than does conventional testing.

AB  - The general objective of a research program on adaptive testing was to identify several sources of potential error in test scores, and to study adaptive testing as a means for reducing these errors. Errors can result from the mismatch of item difficulty to the individual's ability; the psychological effects of testing and the test environment; the inability to extract enough information from the testee's response; deviations from unidimensionality; and an oversimplistic conceptualization of ability. Several different strategies of adaptive testing are discussed, along with the information level they yield, and the bias that can result from various scoring methods. In a discussion of the unidimentionality of test items, the consistency of the testee's response is analyzed. Finally, group differences are examined in terms of the psychological effects of receiving immediate feedback, especially on low ability groups. The author concludes that adaptive testing and immediate knowledge of results may be able to provide testing conditions more conclusive to each person's ability to demonstrate his/her fullest capacities in test performance.

AB  - The effects of a test bias reduction technique on measurement precision in conventional and computer adaptive tests were investigated. Also, the relationships between test type, bias reduction procedures, and examinees' psychological reactions to testing were investigated. Latent trait theory was used in the construction and evaluation of the conventional and adaptive tests which were both administered on a computer terminal. The test items administered in this study were from the Scholastic Aptitude Test verbal section. The adaptive test used a Bayesian sequential item selection strategy to construct individualized 15-item tests for each examinee. The conventional test administered a fixed set of 15 items selected to measure equally well over the entire range of examinee ability. The test bias reduction technique is a three step procedure for selecting items either interactively (adaptive) or a priori (conventional) to be in a test. First, the desired difficulty of the new item is specified. Second, either four or seven items with difficulty levels nearest the desired level are selected from the item pool. Third, the item with the lowest bias is selected to be in the test. The test bias reduction technique substantially reduced the bias index of the items administered to the examinees but also resulted in lower measurement precision of examinee ability. This effect on measurement precision was larger for the conventional test than the adaptive test. The levels of bias reduction, four items scanned for lowest bias compared to seven items scanned, made no difference on the measurement precision of the adaptive test. However, these levels of bias reduction made a difference on the measurement precision of the conventional test. The adaptive test resulted in higher Bayesian modal estimates of ability than those from the conventional test. However, examinees perceived the adaptive test to be more difficult than the conventional test. Examinees' psychological reactions of perceive guessing and perceived performance were affected by the type of test, adaptive or conventional, and were related to test performance independent of examinee ability. Also, the relationship between these psychological reactions and performance was generally greater for conventional than adaptive tests. Therefore, adaptive testing might affect performance scores differently than conventional testing through mediating psychological processes. These findings are discussed in addition to possible directions for future research.

AB  - BackgroundPatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be useful for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts (BLTC) to evaluate the impact of treatment and/or guide shared decision making. Yet, a set of PROMs relevant to patients with BLTC is currently unavailable. In this study, we selected a PROMs set for patients with BLTC.MethodsPotentially relevant patient reported outcomes (PROs) were selected by psychologist-researchers based on keywords used or suggested by participants of two virtual focus groups meetings consisting of thirteen female BLTC patients with a median age of 50<c2><a0>years. Subsequently, patients were asked to report their most relevant PROs. PROMs identified by systematic literature review and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) were considered in selecting the final PROMs set to assess relevant outcomes.ResultsThe most important PROs were: insecurity/anxiety (11/12 patients), pain (9/12 patients), fatigue (8/12 patients), and limitations in daily life (5/12 patients). The literature review included 23 studies, which used various generic and disease-specific PROMs, often not measuring (all) relevant PROs. The final selected PROMs set included numerical rating scales for pain, two questions on overall health and quality of life and four PROMIS CATs.ConclusionsA PROMs set generically and efficiently measuring outcomes relevant for patients with BLTC was developed and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

AB  - ObjectivesTo assess: (1) the prevalence of mental health and substance use in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through use of a computer adaptive test (CATâ€MH), (2) the correlation among CATâ€MH scores and selfâ€ and clinicianâ€reported assessments, and (3) the association between CATâ€MH scores and ED utilization in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment.MethodsThis was a singleâ€center observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED for somatic complaints (97%) from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes were computerâ€adaptiveâ€assessed domains of suicidality, depression, anxiety, postâ€traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We conducted Pearson correlations and logistic regression for objectives 2 and 3, respectively.ResultsFrom a sample of 794 patients, the proportion of those at moderate/severe risk was: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). CATâ€MH domains were highly correlated with selfâ€report assessments (r =Â 0.49â€“0.79). Individuals who had 2 or more ED visits in the prior year had 62% increased odds of being in the intermediateâ€high suicide risk category (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07â€“2.44) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. Individuals who scored in the intermediateâ€highâ€suicide risk group had 63% greater odds of an ED visit within 30 days after enrollment compared to those who scored as low risk (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.44).ConclusionThe CATâ€MH documented that a considerable proportion of ED patients presenting for somatic problems had mental health conditions, even if mild. Mental health problems were also associated with ED utilization.

AB  - Purpose: Problems in speech recognition are often apparent in telecommunication situations. For ecologically valid assessments of such conditions, it is important to quantify the impact of real environments including acoustic conditions at a far-end communication device and all paths of transmission degradation. This study presents an automated matrix sentence test procedure based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) integrated in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure and compares the individual effects of transmission degradations with results from laboratory measurements. Method: Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in 16 normalhearing subjects in four test conditions: (a) a laboratory condition guided by a human experimenter, (b) a laboratory condition with reduced bandwidth and (c) additionally reduced headset quality to simulate typical communication systems, and (d) an automated, ASR-controlled adaptive test procedure over a real VoIP infrastructure. Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and "laboratory" conditions, with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.

CY  - United States -- Minnesota
AB  - In educational tests, a group of questions related to a shared stimulus is called a testlet (e.g., a reading passage with multiple related questions). Use of testlets is very common in educational tests. Additionally, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a mode of testing where the test forms are created in real time tailoring to the test taker's previous responses. CATs have gained popularity because they produce a more accurate test score estimate within a shorter time with fewer questions. In this dissertation, the performance of CAT with testlets was studied. Conditional independence is an essential assumption of Item Response Models. However, when testlets are used, item responses to the items in the same testlet may not be independent since these items are associated with a common stimulus. In this case, the conditional independence assumption is violated, and this violation can affect the entire performance of CAT and lead to inaccurate test scores. Common practice for testlet based CATs is to select a testlet adaptively and administer all the items bundled in the testlet. However, the accuracy and efficiency aspects of CAT may not be fully realized with this approach of adaptivity. To increase the accuracy and efficiency in testlet-based CATs, between and within testlet adaptivity was studied. Other manipulated variables were the level of adaptivity, different testlet/item selection approaches, latent trait estimation methods, test length/number of testlets, and magnitude of testlet dependence. The performances of testlet based CATs with various scenarios were evaluated descriptively by running a series of simulations. One of the important findings of the study is that not only between testlets but also within testlets adaptation improved the performance of the CAT for more accurate and precise estimation of the latent traits. The results will serve as a baseline for future research and practice.

AB  - A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL<c2><a9>) to assess quality of life of children born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance in Dutch children. After Swedish<e2><80><93>Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old children, 8/17 items had >5% missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual child<e2><80><99>s situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in different countries are needed.

TI  - Improving Test Security and Efficiency of Computerized Adaptive Testing for the Force Concept Inventory
JO  - Physical Review Physics Education Research
VL  - 18
PY  - 2022
PB  - American Physical Society
CY  - NA
AB  - This paper presents improvements made to a computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-based version of the FCI (FCI-CAT) in regards to test security and test efficiency. First, we will discuss measures to enhance test security by controlling for item overexposure, decreasing the risk that respondents may (i) memorize the content of a pretest for use on the post-test or (ii) share information about the items with their classmates who take the assessment later. Second, we will discuss measures to enhance test efficiency, so that a shorter test length can yield a desired accuracy and precision of the measurement. Specifically, we utilized collateral information in the form of a pretest proficiency estimate of each respondent for selecting items and estimating respondent proficiency level in the post-test. To shorten the total testing time further, we also allowed the test lengths to be different for the pre- and post-test. To analyze how these improvements affect the accuracy and precision (which we measure in terms of root-mean-square error) of Cohen's d, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation and a "post hoc" simulation. Then, we calculated the minimal test length of the FCI-CAT whose accuracy and precision are equivalent to that of the paper-and-pencil version of the FCI. Consequently, we obtained the following three findings: (i) By using collateral information, we can achieve the accuracy and precision of the full-length FCI with fewer items via the FCI-CAT. (ii) For a class size of 40, we can control for test security while still reducing the sum of the pre- and post-test lengths of the FCI-CAT to a total of 33 items (17 items on the pretest and 16 items on the post-test), thereby reducing the testing time to 55%. (iii) If one's goal is to maximize test efficiency, the pretest length should be slightly larger than the post-test length. On the other hand, if the goal is to maximize test security, the pretest length should be smaller and the post-test length should be larger. If one desires a balance of these two goals, it would be reasonable to choose equal pre- and post-test lengths.

TI  - Developing a Web-Based App to Assess Mental Health Difficulties in Secondary School Pupils: Qualitative User-Centered Design Study
JO  - JMIR Formative Research
VL  - 6
PY  - 2022
PB  - JMIR Publications
CY  - Toronto
AB  - Background: Secondary schools are an ideal setting to identify young people experiencing mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression. However, current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment. Objective: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools. Methods: This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cycles<e2><80><94>an initial stakeholder consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed. Results: Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for designing mental health assessment apps are also provided. Conclusions: Artemis-A is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training. Future research will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Artemis-A in a range of UK secondary schools.

TI  - Item Characteristic Curve Asymmetry: A Better Way to Accommodate Slips and Guesses than a Four-Parameter Model?

CY  - NA
AB  - Four-parameter models have received increasing psychometric attention in recent years, as a reduced upper asymptote for item characteristic curves can be appealing for measurement applications such as adaptive testing and person-fit assessment. However, applications can be challenging due to the large number of parameters in the model. In this article, we demonstrate in the context of mathematics assessments how the slip and guess parameters of a four-parameter model may often be empirically related. This observation also has a psychological explanation to the extent that both asymptote parameters may be manifestations of a single item complexity characteristic. The relationship between lower and upper asymptotes motivates the consideration of an asymmetric item response theory model as a three-parameter alternative to the four-parameter model. Using actual response data from mathematics multiple-choice tests, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of a three-parameter asymmetric model in several standardized tests of mathematics. To the extent that a model of asymmetry ultimately portrays slips and guesses not as purely random but rather as proficiency-related phenomena, we argue that the asymmetric approach may also have greater psychological plausibility.

CY  - United States -- Iowa
AB  - In recent decades, computerized multistage testing (MST) has been utilized as an alternative testing mode for large-scale testing programs. Although the usage of MST has been discussed extensively, there is little literature that addresses its psychometric properties. The motivation of this dissertation arises from the need to properly estimate psychometric properties under the MST framework. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrated set of formulas for estimating psychometric properties for MST, including error variance, reliability, and classification indices. To achieve this goal, existing methods that are used for the traditional P\&P tests are extended to the MST context, if possible; and new methods are proposed based on the characteristics of MST (i.e., routing probability) for the ML and EAP estimators. For the ML estimator, a conventional approach to computing MST test information analytically is also included for estimating the psychometric properties. The proposed approach and the conventional approach are then applied to a single set of MST data, with varied conditions. Further, a simulation approach is employed for the purpose of understanding and comparing the performance of the proposed approach and conventional approach. In the simulation approach, replications of test data are used to obtain results. The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) for the ML estimator, the proposed analytic approach performed better than the conventional approach, indicated by comparing their results with those from the simulation approach; (2) for the EAP estimator, results from using the Bayesian approach approach led to smaller values of marginal error variances and higher values of reliability, compared with the quadrature approach; (3) longer test resulted in decreased error variances and improved reliability; (4) for the EAP Bayesian approach, increasing sample size had a limited impact on the estimation results; (5) for all the approaches, conditional classification consistency and accuracy gradually decreased when the ability parameter was moving further away from the cut scores. All of the estimation formulas provided in this dissertation can be applied directly to MST data in practice.

AB  - Objectives:The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used measure of perceived stress; however, minimal psychometric evaluation has been performed among Hispanic respondents, and even less among Hispanic caregivers to persons with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related disorders (ADRDs).Design:Secondary data analysis.Setting:New York City, NY, USA.Participants:A sample of 453 community dwelling Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD.Measurements:Latent variable models were used to evaluate the PSS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine unidimensionality. Differential item functioning (DIF) was examined for age, education, and language using the graded item response model.Results:The factor and bifactor analyses results supported essential unidimensionality of the item set; however, positively worded items were observed using response item theory to be less informative than the negatively worded items. Reliability estimates were high. Salient DIF was not observed for age, education, or language of interview using the primary DIF detection method. Sensitivity analyses using a second DIF detection method identified uniform language-DIF for the item, â€œIn the last month, how often have you felt that you were on top of things?â€ However, the non-compensatory DIF value was below the threshold considered salient.Conclusions:In summary, the 10-item PSS performed well in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. Very little DIF, and none of high magnitude and impact, was observed. However, the negatively worded items, perhaps because they are more directly reflective of stress, were more informative. In the context of a short-form measure or computerized adaptive test, more informative items are those that would be selected for inclusion.

AB  - Background and aimsThe focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multiâ€dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and riskâ€taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the itemâ€bank, (2) calibrate the itemâ€bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptomâ€specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CATâ€SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain.DesignItem bank construction, item calibration phase, CATâ€SUD validation phase.SettingPrimary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patientâ€toâ€patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles).Participants/casesCalibration phase: the CATâ€SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CATâ€SUD.MeasurementsA total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CATâ€SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis.FindingsCalibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multiâ€dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (>Â 0.4 with the majority >Â 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2Â minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168â€item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100â€point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CATâ€SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20â€fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CATâ€SUD (AUCÂ =Â 0.85).ConclusionsWe have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multiâ€dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CATâ€SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD.

AB  - Background Chronic low back pain (cLBP) results in significant physical, psycho-social and socioeconomic burden. Identifying efficient and reliable patient reported outcome measures is critical for research and clinical purposes. The NIHâ€™s Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments have not been compared to validated â€œlegacyâ€ instruments in older adults with cLBP. This study evaluates construct (convergent and discriminant) validity and time to complete (TTC) PROMIS as compared to legacy instruments. Methods We enrolled older Veterans (age 60+) with cLBP with/without leg pain scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Subjects completed PROMIS computer adaptive test item banks and corresponding legacy instruments in the following domains: pain intensity, interference, and behavior; functional status; depression and anxiety; fatigue; sleep and social functioning. Convergent and discriminant validity between PROMIS and legacy instruments was evaluated using Spearman rank order correlations; Mann-Whitney U tests compared TTC. Results Of the 71 Veterans recruited, the median (IQR) age was 67 (63<e2><80><93>71) years old, 94% were men, 76% were White, 17% Black, and 96% were Non-Hispanic. Spearman correlations between PROMIS and legacy instruments showed moderate to very strong convergent validity in all domains (r<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.4<e2><80><93>1.0), except for social functioning and pain behavior (PROMIS Pain Behavior with Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire). The total median TTC for all PROMIS items was significantly shorter than legacy items, 8<e2><80><89>min 50<e2><80><89>s vs 29<e2><80><89>min 14<e2><80><89>s respectively, p<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.001. Conclusions Given time efficiency of using PROMIS, along with strong construct validity, PROMIS instruments are a practical choice for measuring multidimensional PROs in older Veterans with cLBP for both research and clinical purposes.

TI  - Are student nurses ready for new technologies in mental health? Mixed-methods study
JO  - Nurse Education Today
VL  - 84

CY  - Edinburgh
AB  - Background Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. Method Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. Results We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.

AB  - This study investigates the performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF procedures independently and in comparative terms in a computerized multistage testing (MST) environment. A simulation study was conducted to mimic an operational testing environment. Three factors that may typically affect DIF detection in an MST environment were manipulated <e2><80><93> sample size (250, 500), impact (0, 0.5, 1) and DIF magnitude (0.45, 0.9). A fourth factor (DIF method) was included at the analysis stage to understand its effect on the outcomes. The criteria for evaluating the results were Type I error rates and power rates. Results reveal that MH has better control of Type I error rates across various study conditions. With respect to power, MH was more powerful in detecting large DIF for the large sample size condition (power rate of 1.00) compared to CATSIB, which had power rates between .84 and 1.00 under the same conditions. Regression results reveal that there were interaction effects of the study factors on Type I error rates and power rates. These results will guide practitioners on best practices regarding DIF detection procedures under various conditions in computerized MST environments. This research adds to the extant literature that promotes psychometric methods that can assist in ensuring that operational test scores are aligned with the principals of item-level statistical fairness.

AB  - Skeptics of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trend for International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) argue that while US elementary and high school students are behind their peers in other nations, the US workforce is still excellent because of the high quality post-secondary educational institutions in the US. However, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) indicates that US adults are in fact far behind their international peers in literacy, numeracy, and technology-based problem solving. Through the use of data mining, this study explored the possible association between PIAAC scores and several constructs. Since the US, Canada, and New Zealand were considered culturally similar nations, according to cluster analysis, patterns between PIAAC scores and selected constructs were analyzed by a variety of big data analytical methods, including cluster analysis, bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and data visualization. Given that PIAAC used multiple computerized adaptive testing, the consequential plausible values were randomly selected when the ensemble approach was used. Additionally, model comparison was utilized to decide between bagging and boosting in order to select the optimal model for each sample. In these samples, cultural engagement, readiness to learn, and social trust, respectively emerged as strong predictors for learning outcomes as they were assessed by PIAAC.

TI  - Optimizing Design of Incorporating Off-Grade Items for Constrained Computerized Adaptive Testing in K-12 Assessment
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
VL  - NA
PY  - 2019
PB  - The University of Iowa
CY  - United States -- Iowa
AB  - Incorporating off-grade items within an on-grade item pool is often seen in K-12 testing programs. Incorporating off-grade items may provide improvements in measurement precision, test length, and content blueprint fulfillment, especially for high- and low-performing examinees, but it may also identify some concerns when using too many off-grade items on tests that are primarily designed to measure grade-level standards. This dissertation investigates how practical constraints such as the number of on-grade items, the proportion, and range of off-grade items, and the stopping rules affect item pool characteristics and item pool performance in adaptive testing.This study includes simulation conditions with four study factors: (1) three on-grade pool sizes (150, 300, and 500 items), (2) three proportions of off-grade items in the item pool (small, moderate, and large), (3) two ranges of off-grade items (one grade level and two grade levels), and (4) two stopping rules (variable- and fixed-length stopping rule) with two SE threshold levels. All the results are averaged across 200 replications for each simulation condition.The item pool characteristics are summarized using descriptive statistics and histograms of item difficulty (the b-parameters), descriptive statistics and plots of test information functions (TIFs), and the standard errors of the ability estimate (SEEs). The item pool performance is evaluated based on the descriptive statistics of measurement precision, test length and exposure properties, content blueprint fulfillment, and mean proportion of off-grade items for each test.The results show that there are some situations in which incorporating off-grade items would be beneficial. For example, a testing organization with a small item pool attempting to improve item pool performance for high- and low-performing examinees. The results also show that practical constraints of incorporating off-grade items, organized here from most impact to least impact in item pool characteristics and item pool performance, are: 1) incorporating off-grade items into small baseline pool or large baseline pool; 2) broadening the range of off-grade items from one grade level to two grade levels; 3) increasing the proportion of off-grade items in the item pool; and 4) applying variable- or fixed-length CAT. The results indicated that broadening the range of off-grade items yields improvements in measurement precision and content blueprint fulfillment when compared to increasing the proportion of off-grade items. This study could serve as guidance for test organizations when considering the benefits and limitations of incorporating off-grade items into on-grade item pools.

AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

AB  - Objective This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. Methods Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; aged 7<e2><80><93>17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. Results Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. Conclusions HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

PB  - Elsevier Science Ltd.
CY  - London
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone<c2><a9> crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

AB  - Background The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Methods All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. Results The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170 <c2><b1> 67 s (average <c2><b1> Stdev) to answer 25 <c2><b1> 6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R2 values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R2 values of 0.5236. Conclusions PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

AB  - Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security Administration<e2><80><99>s (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood & emotions, resilience, social interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition & communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental health subdomains: Cognition & Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 items), Resilience & Sociability (29 items) and Mood & Emotions (34 items). All scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational rehabilitation settings.

AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

AB  - High-stakes licensure or certification examinations are required for many health professions disciplines to ensure safe entry-level practice. Accrediting agencies set a benchmark for graduates<e2><80><99> first-time licensure or certification success as a measure of program effectiveness. Failures of graduates on licensure or certification examinations may directly affect the school<e2><80><99>s recruitment and retention of qualified students and faculty, as well as institutional financial viability. A health science university has added Health Education System, Inc. (HESI) standardized examinations using computer adaptive testing into the family nurse practitioner (FNP) master<e2><80><99>s program to support certification success, although research on these advanced practice examinations as related to certification outcomes was lacking. Guided by classical test theory, this study was an investigation of whether a relationship existed between students<e2><80><99> performance on 4 HESI standardized examinations (Advanced Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacotherapeutics, Advanced Health Assessment, and the APRN/FNP Exit exam) and first-time FNP certification success. Binary logistic regression analysis of data from 117 students who graduated between 2013<e2><80><93>2016 indicated that none of the 4 standardized HESI examinations significantly predicted FNP certification success, perhaps due to the examinations not carrying any evaluative weight within the program. The results of this project study may be used to promote positive social change by providing a means to improve first-time certification success and increasing the availability of primary care providers in the role of FNP.

AB  - Context: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. Objective: This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. Methods: Patients (ages 7-22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. Results: Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

TI  - Aberrant response detection using change-point analysis
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

CY  - United States -- Indiana
AB  - Aberrant responses, which are caused by examinees' unusual behaviors (e.g., carelessness, speededness, item pre-knowledge, warm-up, copying answers from neighbors), are frequently seen in various testing programs. Having aberrant responses may bias item parameter estimates and threaten test validity. Thus proper modeling and detection of aberrant responses is crucial both theoretically and practically in educational and psychological measurement. Previous work has primarily approached the aberrant responses research in terms of developing person fit statistics and proposing models to capture the aberrant behaviors. This dissertation attempts to incorporate change-point analysis (CPA) to investigate two types of aberrant responses: speededness and warm-up effect; both of which can be viewed as having an abrupt change point. This is an extension work of Shao, Li, and Cheng (in press) which first introduced the CPA method to detect test speededness with known item parameters. Following this line of research, three studies are carried out. The first study investigates whether CPA can help improve item calibration in the presence of speededness. In this study, the CPA method is used to first detect speeded responses with unknown item parameters. After the detection of speeded examinees as well as their corresponding speeding point (the point at which an examinee starts to speed), a cleansing procedure based upon the detected speeding point is proposed to help improve item parameter estimation. The performance of speededness detection as well as the item parameter recovery before/after utilizing the cleansing procedure are evaluated. The second study applies the CPA method to warm-up effect detection. This study first compares the impact of warm-up effect on ability estimation and examinees' classification accuracy on two types of tests: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Paper and Pencil (linear) Testing. In the second step, the CPA based detection of warm-up effect is carried out. Two methods of obtaining the critical values are utilized in the study. Different from the first two studies which both conduct CPA using item response information, the third study applies CPA to response time data in speededness detection. A gradual change log-normal model is proposed to better model the real-life change of response time affected by speededness. Two test statistics are introduced to test for a change point using response time. Moreover, this study explores the possibility of using a fixed critical value across conditions at each nominal level so that practitioners do not have to obtain a critical value through simulation every time they run speededness detection. The dissertation thesis concludes with the final chapter including a discussion of the results, limitations, practical implications, and future directions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which item response theory (IRT) proficiency estimation methods are robust to the presence of aberrant responses under the "GRE"<c2><ae> General Test multistage adaptive testing (MST) design. To that end, a wide range of atypical response behaviors affecting as much as 10% of the test items were simulated using a generic GRE 2-stage MST and the 2-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model. As expected, some differences were found among the 5 estimators in terms of the recovery of the true theta ability; for example, Bayesian estimators had lower error variance and their estimates were regressed to the mean.Once the IRT theta estimates were scaled onto a comparable reporting score scale, however, it was found that all the estimation methods investigated, including the one currently used to score GRE MSTs, were equally robust under the simulated conditions.

PB  - University of Washington
CY  - United States -- Washington
AB  - Animal carcinogenicity experiments are conducted by private entities and government agencies to investigate whether a substance causes cancer. Since most tumors are occult and it is necessary to conduct a necropsy to detect the presence of cancer, producing unbiased tests for differences in tumor incidence is challenging. The highest doses given in these experiments often have toxic effects in the animals or might affect tumor lethality, and many common statistical methods for survival data perform poorly when such effects induce differences in mortality across treatment groups. The poly- k test, developed by Bailer & Portier (1988) as a modification of the Cochran-Armitage test, was designed to avoid problems from differential mortality, but is based on strong parametric assumptions, specifically that underlying tumor hazard may be modeled as Weibull with shape parameter k (usually set to 3). Existing literature that examines the performance of the poly-k and competitor tests assumes Weibull tumor hazards, and finds that the poly-k can be biased under treatment toxicity when its shape parameter assumption is not met. Given that this test has become a standard for government agencies such as the National Toxicology Program and the FDA, closer examination is warranted. Our simulations examine the performance of the poly-k under non-Weibull tumor hazards, and find that our own parametric tests can outperform it under these conditions. For tests like the poly-k, our goal is to develop and examine the performance of adaptive testing algorithms that estimate a test's parameter based on the data; one such estimation was suggested under Weibull assumptions by Moon et al. (2003), though their approach based on estimating lifetime cumulative tumor incidence rates does not make full use of the available data, and requires that the experiment include multiple interim sacrifices for adequate performance. Under most of our simulation settings, our k<cb><86> MLE test, based on estimating the shape parameter k by maximizing the full likelihood, has type I error and power very similar to the poly-k test with correctly-specified k, and it maintains size better, with comparable or higher power, than the test based on the Moon et al. estimate. Our MLE-based test does not require interim sacrifices, although it may perform better under some interim sacrifice experimental designs. We compare these tests under a variety of parametric assumptions and serial sacrifice designs to examine which experimental settings are most optimal for test performance.

AB  - This thesis sought to address the application of non-parametric item response theory (NIRT) to cognitive and functional assessment in dementia. Performance on psychometric tests is key to diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. NIRT can be used to improve the psychometric properties of tests used in dementia assessment in multiple ways: confirming an underlying unidimensional structure, establishing formal item hierarchical patterns of decline, increasing insight by examining item parameters such as difficulty and discrimination, and creating shorter tests. From a NIRT approach item difficulty refers to the ease with which an item is endorsed. Discrimination is an index of how well an item can differentiate between patients of varying levels of severity. Firstly I carried out a systematic review to identify applications of both parametric and non-parametric IRT to measures assessing global cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This review demonstrated that IRT can increase the interpretive power of cognitive assessment scales and confirmed the limited number of IRT analyses of cognitive scales in dementia populations. This thesis extended this approach by applying Mokken scaling analysis to commonly used measures of current cognitive ability (Addenbrooke<e2><80><99>s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)) and of premorbid cognitive ability (National Adult Reading Test (NART)). Differential item functioning (DIF) by diagnosis identified slight variations in the patterns of hierarchical decline in the ACE-R. These disease-specific sequences of decline could serve as an adjunct to diagnosis, for example where learning a name and address is a more difficult task than being orientated in time, late onset Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease is a more probable diagnosis than mixed Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s and vascular dementia. These analyses also allowed key items to be identified which can be used to create briefer scales (mini-ACE and Mini-NART) which have good psychometric properties. These scales are clinically relevant, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items. They also allow sensitive measurement and adaptive testing and can reduce test administration time and patient stress. Impairment of functional abilities represents a crucial component of dementia diagnosis with performance on these functional tasks predictive of overall disease. A second aspect of this thesis, therefore, was the application of Mokken scaling analyses to measures of functional decline in dementia, specifically the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS). While gender DIF was observed for several items, implying the likelihood of equal responses from men and women is not equal a generally consistent pattern of impairment in functional ability was observed across different types of dementia.

CY  - England
AB  - It is known that the stiffness of many soils is higher at small strains than at the large strains used in typical triaxial testing. Understanding this initial high stiffness and the factors affecting it is key to accurate displacement predictions. The recent stress history (RSH) effect describes how the stiffness degradation curve at small strains is affected by the immediately preceding stress path. The effect is usually described in terms of stress path rotation angle between an approach path and the shear probe upon which stiffness degradation is measured. The principle aim of the work was to investigate the relationship between the RSH effect, approach path length, and time dependent effects in more detail. A combination of physical testing and simulations with the BRICK constitutive model were used to achieve this. This has shown that in multistage testing the residual RSH effect from the first test increased the stiffness exhibited in the second, thus masking the natural behaviour. In addition the stress path rotation from consolidation to testing caused a stiffness reduction in the first test. This effect, newly termed recent consolidation history (RCH), was found to be degraded by the first test and so did not impact on the second. When allowance was made for these effects trends seen in the literature were supported. Due to the complex stress paths used in the physical testing, a number of improvements were required to the strain rate dependent (SRD) BRICK model to allow accurate simulations to be run. These included implementation of a bisecting iteration within the strain calculations, and a coordinate decent routine to allow creep and creep rupture to be modelled. The model was then used to simulate the physical tests to allow more insight into the interplay between the effects identified in the physical testing, ultimately supporting the conclusions drawn.

AB  - We propose a novel group testing framework, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome screening experiments in addition to other applications such as interpretable rule learning for decision making. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an integer-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a unifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing models are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the notion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable test matrices, representing generalizations of classical disjunct and separable matrices. We describe combinatorial and probabilistic constructions for such matrices without considering any restriction on the thresholds of the SQGT model (i.e. SQGT with arbitrary thresholds). Then, we focus on the important special case in which the thresholds are equidistant, and construct SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable matrices for this model. While for most of the constructions described in this dissertation, it is assumed that the number of defectives is much smaller than total number of test subjects, we also consider the case in which there is no restriction on the number of defectives and they may be as large as the total number of subjects. For the constructed matrices, we describe a number of efficient decoding algorithms based on algebraic methods and message passing on graphical models. Finally, we introduce the novel probabilistic group testing framework of Poisson group testing, applicable to dynamic testing with diminishing relative rates of defectives. For this new model, we consider both nonadaptive and adaptive testing schemes and develop lower bounds and tight constructive upper bounds on the number of required tests.

AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context. The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24 p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature. Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

AB  - Nursing programs increasingly use exit exams to increase graduating nursing students' readiness for the nurse licensing examination. These exams prepare students for computer adaptive testing and identify areas where remediation is needed. This study examines an Associate Degree in Nursing program that has shown consistently low exit exam scores causing delays in student graduation, eligibility to sit for the licensing exam, and entry into the workforce. The study was crafted to investigate student perspectives of the barriers to student success on the Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) exit exam. It employed a quantitative one-shot survey design to evaluate factors related to performance on the HESI exit exam, including lack of study time, lack of knowledge despite passing nursing courses, lack of motivation to prepare for the exam, overwhelming stress, poor test-taking skills, and lack of confidence. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that students' self-perceptions of poor test-taking skills had a significant negative effect on HESI exit exam scores. These findings were used to design a project focused on teaching test-taking skills throughout the nursing program. The study and project collectively promote positive social change by providing a means to improve nursing program graduation rates, a tool of great importance in addressing the current shortage of nurses in the United States' workforce.

AB  - Fueled by rapid technological and methodological development, research in the area of genetic epidemiology has brought many successes as well as analytical challenges in identification of genetic risk factors for disease risk. Many have predicted that the detection of heritable disease susceptibility variants could eventually lead to stable models for prediction of disease risk. This dissertation is devoted to the statistical methodological consideration and development in genetic association studies, as well as the use of weighted genetic risk score in predictive modeling of disease risk. We begin the work by reviewing a brief background into genetic association studies, predictive modeling and relevant analytic challenges. In Chapter 2, we discuss the theoretical relationship between classical multiple linear regression (MLR) and two-stage residual-outcome regression analysis (2SR) in terms of confounding adjustment. We demonstrate that the 2SR would introduce bias and loss of power in the presence of confounding, and thus remind researchers to be cautious in applying the 2SR in genetic association studies. In Chapter 3, we propose an adaptive permutation procedure in testing the significance of susceptibility genetic variants. Results show that the adaptive test is statistically valid as well as computationally feasible in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recommendations are made for the implementation of adaptive permutation in real studies. In Chapter 4, we develop an explained-variance based genetic risk score (GRS) for predictive modeling of disease risk. Extensive simulation studies suggest that this new weighted GRS is a robust risk score approach that consistently outperforms simple count and odds ratio based GRS approaches. In Chapter 5, we further explore the performance of GRS approaches in the presence of interactions, including statistical interaction, dependence and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results emphasize the advantage of weighted GRS even in more complicated settings, motivating its application in predictive modeling. This work concludes with several practical guidelines in genetic association studies and predictive modeling, and discussions of future perspectives.

AB  - The major concerns of adaptive testing studies have concentrated on effectiveness and efficiency of the system built for the research experiments. It has been criticised that such general information has fallen short of providing qualitative descriptions regarding learning performance. Takahiro Sato of Japan proposed an analytical diagram called Student-Problem Chart (S-P Chart) in the 1970. The S-P Chart is able to establish a learning diagnostic table which comments student learning performance in a verbal form. The advancement of computer technology has made the S-P analytical process more applicable for school teachers. This study examined how online comments provided by the S-P diagnostic table could affect the students' learning attitude. One hundred sixth grade students were selected to be the subjects of the study. An online embedded test was given to the subjects and an S-P diagnostic table was drawn by the computer to display instant comments on each student's learning performance. A Questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews were performed after the experiment. Results indicated that students liked the online qualitative comments. This is because students were able to instantly understand why they performed well/poor in the test, which is much beyond the numerical scores can explain. The results also showed that the online S-P diagnostic table made students more circumspect on answering the test questions in order to reduce careless mistakes. Students would also be more likely to review what they missed on the test. However, the S-P comment table seemed to have no effect on improving their learning performance. An online iterative drilling platform was consequently built to incorporate with the S-P diagnostic process to assist poorly performed students. It may effectively work with the S-P diagnostic process to provide constructive remediation for the students who exhibited a poor performance on the S-P chart.

AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N=100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N=101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - The aim of the current study is to shed new light on the inconsistent relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining feedback type as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task? showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by feedback type. Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and feedback type also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used in a wide range of human resource and performance management instruments (e.g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/360 degree feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees' reactions and rate of performance improvement.

AB  - Both theoretical and practical considerations have led the revision of the Graduate Record Examinations<c2><ae> (GRE<c2><ae>) revised General Test, here called the rGRE, to adopt a multistage adaptive design that will be continuously or nearly continuously administered and that can provide immediate score reporting. These circumstances sharply constrain the available options for equating or linking together the thousands of unique test forms that will need to be administered each year. The only practical method is to pre-equate each form through item response theory (IRT) methods. Unfortunately, doing so means that item position and context effects are both vitally important and potentially difficult to control. This study examines item position effects in a GRE context and attempts to assess the extent to which they may affect the rGRE. It was found that position effects are in fact present in GRE data and that they can be particularly troublesome under multistage testing. Pretest strategies are able to mitigate effects to some degree, but complete control will require careful attention be paid to the time limits and associated test configuration details in the design of the rGRE.

AB  - Semiconductor technology scaling has long been a source of dramatic gains in our computing capabilities. However, as we test the physical limits of silicon feature size, serious reliability and computational efficiency challenges confront us. The supply voltage levels have practically stagnated, resulting in increasing power densities and operating temperatures. Given that most semiconductor wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Further, the rise in power density is also limiting the number of resources that can be kept active on chip simultaneously, motivating the need for energy-efficient computing. In this landscape of technological challenges, incremental architectural improvements to existing designs are likely insufficient, motivating a need to rethink the architectural fabric from the ground up. Towards this end, this thesis presents adaptive architecture and compiler solutions that can effectively tackle reliability, performance and energy-efficiency demands expected in future microprocessors. For the reliability challenge, we present StageNet, a highly reconfigurable multicore architecture that is designed as a network of pipeline stages, rather than isolated cores. The interconnection flexibility in StageNet allows it to adaptively route around defective pieces of a processor, and deliver graceful performance degradation in the face of failures. We further complement the fault isolation ability of StageNet with an adaptive testing framework that significantly reduces the overhead of in-field fault detection. As a second contribution, we build upon the interconnection flexibility of StageNet to develop a unified performance-reliability solution. This subsequent design, named CoreGenesis, relies on a set of microarchitectural innovations and compiler hints to merge processor cores for a higher single-thread performance. This enables customization of processing ability (narrow or wide-issue pipelines) to the dynamic workload requirements. In the final work of this thesis, we investigate the sources of computational inefficiency in general purpose processors, and propose a configurable compute engine, named BERET, for substantial energy savings. The insight here is to cut down on the redundant instruction fetch, decode and register file access energy by optimizing the execution of recurring instruction sequences.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that commonly manifests in the feet as pain, swelling and deformity. These symptoms often have extensive and severe mutlidimensional consequences for people's lives and can be evaluated using a class of subjective outcome measures known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs have been advocated by the Darzi report and are central to reforms in the NHS.Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a new and novel PROM, the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument (SAFE), using a clinimetric approach and featuring an adequately pre-tested nomothetic (fixed scale) and idiographic (patient-specific scale) assessment strategy. A mixed methods approach was employed to develop the SAFE, with the formulation and implementation of a four phase sequential exploratory fully mixed methods design (SEMMD) that featured equal priority between the qualitative and quantitative components.The four phase SEMMD enabled the strategic and effective combination of methods to produce a PROM that is firmly rooted in the views and experiences of people with feet affected by RA. The nomothetic scale of the SAFE has evidence for face, content and convergent validity (Spearman-Rank co-efficients: 0.62 - 0.80) and excellent one week test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.86 - 1.00 ). The idiographic scale has evidence for face and content validity.The SAFE is a tool for both clinical practice and clinical research. In order to realise the full potential of the SAFE, further research will be undertaken to refine, develop the PROM and integrate it into clinical practice. Initially, it will be necessary to demonstrate additional measurement properties for the nomothetic scale, including clinical interpretability and responsiveness and also necessary to demonstrate quantitative measurement properties for the idiographic scale. Long term, the SAFE will be redeveloped using item response theory and implemented as a computerised adaptive test.

AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

AB  - Although social well-being (SWB) is recognized as an integral component of health, it is rarely included in health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments. Two SWB dimensions were identified by literature review: social support (SWB-SS) and social function (SWB-SF). As part of a larger project to develop item response theory-derived item banks and computerized adaptive testing, we developed and tested items for the SWB banks. Item ratings of three large (n greater than 600) datasets were conducted by 15 reviewers. Rasch measurement analyses were conducted to initially define item hierarchies. Out of 83 total items, 8 were removed due to model misfit and 8 were removed because of overlapping item content. We then wrote 11 new SWB-SS and 16 new SWB-SF items to fill content gaps, and edited items to improve comprehension and consistency. A total of 94 items (65 SWB-SS, 29 SWB-SF) was administered by computer to 202 cancer patients. Confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch analyses, and evaluations of construct validity were performed. Patients commented favorably on the content of the items and expressed appreciation for attention to this aspect of their HRQL. Using current psychometric standards for unidimensionality, reliability, and content and construct validity, we derived six preliminary item banks for social support (instrumental support, informational support, positive and negative emotional support, positive and negative social companionship) and two for social function (limitations and satisfaction). The empirical construct hierarchy was consistent with clinical observations; e.g., hobbies and leisure activities tended to reflect more limitations, while meeting the needs of family and friends tended to reflect fewer limitations. Optimal care for patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses includes obtaining a complete picture of patients' physical and properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment.psychosocial health status. SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With

AB  - Bayesian graphical models are commonly used to build student models from data. A number of standard algorithms are available to train Bayesian models from student skills assessment data. These models can assess student knowledge and skills from a few observations. They are useful for Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), for example, where the test items can be administered in order to maximize the information they will provide. In practice, such data often contain missing values and, under some circumstances, missing values far outnumber observed values. However, when collecting data from test results, one can often choose which values will be present or missing by a consequent test design. We study how to optimize the choice of test items for collecting the data that will be used for training a Bayesian CAT model, such as to maximize the predictive performance of the model. We explore the use of a simple heuristic for test item choice based on the level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of an item is derived from its initial probability of success and, thus, from its difficulty. The results show that this choice does affect model performance and that the heuristic can lead to better performance. Although the study<e2><80><99>s results are more exploratory than conclusive, they suggest interesting research avenues.

CY  - United States -- Illinois
AB  - This dissertation investigated the impact of item parameter drift (IPD) on examinee ability measures, in the analysis of data generated from a computerized adaptive test (CAT) collected in year 2003 by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in a Medical Technologist (MT) examination. For the 2003 ASCP MT exam, the item bank included 1,270 items. Items were selected from seven subscales: (a) blood banking, (b) chemistry, (c) hematology, (d) immunology, (e) laboratory operations, (f) microbiology, and (g) urinalysis. ASCP administered this CAT to 2,555 examinees. The data were analyzed using a new hierarchical linear model (HLM), called the Rasch longitudinal model (RLM), which models interaction between the item and time, in addition to parameters of examinee ability and item difficulty (easiness). The analysis demonstrated how IPD within the item bank for the ASCP MT exam affected examinee ability measures, and the extent to which IPD altered certification or pass-fail decisions. The RLM identified items that exhibited significant IPD for each subscale and provided the magnitude (and direction) of IPD within the 2003 ASCP MT exam data. No one subscale was more sensitive to IPD than any other. Further, by including significant time effects (IPD), the RLM provided a better fit to the data than the Rasch model as an HLM. The RLM not only determined items exhibiting IPD but also compensated for the existence of IPD within the calculation of examinee abilities by using the drifted item difficulty value versus the anchored one. Consequently, the RLM provided more accurate measures of examinee ability and item difficulty than the Rasch model as analyzed using the WINSTEPS program As a result, using the RLM yielded a more efficient IPD detection method, one that identified items with IPD but also corrected the estimation of examinee abilities for the existence of IPD.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which administers only items relevant to respondents<e2><80><99> ability, has the advantage of measuring persons<e2><80><99> ability precisely with considerably fewer items than traditional tests. CAT has been proposed for use in healthcare to reduce the respondents<e2><80><99>, administrators<e2><80><99> or researchers<e2><80><99> burden in clinics/clinical trials. However, there have been few studies in healthcare that have investigated the optimal characteristics of a CAT. The objective of my study was to investigate: (1) the psychometrics of an item bank measuring upper extremity (UE) disorders for CAT use, (2) how different testing procedures affect the ability estimates from CAT, and (3) whether CAT produce better ability estimates than a traditional static short assessment. The psychometrics of the item bank developed by combining items from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Upper Extremity Functional Index were examined by confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis across body part impairments (neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand). Repeated-measures MANOVA was used to investigate the standard error (SE) and bias of ability estimates from CAT with different testing procedures. Structural equation modeling was implemented to examine the correlations between ability estimates from the full test and different CAT structures and the full test with a short form. Further, paired-sample t test was performed to investigate the SE and bias of ability estimates from CAT and a static short form. In general, the item bank was found essentially unidimensional, the generalized partial credit model fit to the data better than partial credit model and there was no significant DIF. The ability estimates from CAT with expected a posteriori ability estimation method was found to be more precise and more comparable to those from full test than ability estimates derived from the maximum likelihood estimation. Further, CAT had better precision, comparability to full test and sensitivity to detect change than a static short form. The findings from this study suggest that UE CAT differ across estimations methods and are significantly better than a short form version.

CY  - United States -- North Dakota
AB  - In the current environment of federally mandated high-stakes testing, teachers and schools are under great pressure to ensure that students demonstrate proficiency on state assessments. Without formative feedback that connects what a teacher did in the classroom with positive outcomes on the state assessment, a teacher may not feel that he or she can make a difference in how students fare on the state assessment. Teachers who experience low self-efficacy use less effective teaching techniques, and this affects student learning. Many schools are now using computer adaptive testing, such as the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA-MAP), to provide teachers with formative information to use for instructional improvement. When adjustments to instruction result in higher student achievement, it can provide the teacher with mastery experiences that increase the teacher's efficacy perceptions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teachers' efficacy beliefs for making a difference in their students' performances on the state assessment and teachers' uses of NWEA-MAP test results. Teachers were surveyed using four measures of teacher efficacy and collective teacher efficacy. Two measures that were created for this study demonstrated high reliability with the study sample and correlated well with the two existing scales. Data were also collected on the ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information and the number of different ways they used score information. The results indicated that the number of ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information made a significant difference in teachers' scores on the efficacy measures: Using score information in three or four different ways was associated with the highest scores on the efficacy scales. Also, using test score information to set goals with students and to individualize instruction predicted teachers' efficacy scores to a greater degree than did using scores to adjust curriculum and instruction. The current study, with its two new measures and its suggestions of relationships between variables, provides a starting point for new lines of research in sources of teacher efficacy beliefs.

PB  - The University of Nebraska - Lincoln
CY  - United States -- Nebraska
AB  - This study examined the amount of time spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items. Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels. A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners<e2><80><99> manual.

JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

PB  - University of Delaware
CY  - United States -- Delaware
AB  - Computer Adaptive Sequential Testing (CAST) is a test delivery model that combines features of the traditional conventional paper-and-pencil testing and item-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The basic structure of CAST is a panel composed of multiple testlets adaptively administered to examinees at different stages. Current applications of CAST reply on the item response theory (IRT) and assume a unidimensional IRT model for scoring. This study evaluated the robustness of CAST when tests were constructed, administered, and scored by a unidimensional IRT model but item responses were multidimensional. Various conditions of multidimensionality were simulated in item pools, as well as different levels of content misclassification through manipulation of the correspondence between content area and dimension of items. An automated test assembly (ATA) process constructed CAST panels from the item pools, each representing a unique combination of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Administration of the panels was simulated and multidimensional response data were scored by the unidimensional IRT model. The ability scores, routing decisions, and pass-fail decisions were evaluated against "true" ability scores and decisions to assess the impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Results showed that, when multidimensionality was mild as measured by the angle distance between item clusters, unidimensional ability estimates and routing decisions were not sensitive to the level of content misclassification in item pools. Only when multidimensionality was severe, panels without content misclassification yielded more accurate ability estimates and routing decisions. However, type I errors of pass-fail decisions (defined as passing unqualified examinees) were the smallest for panels without content misclassification, regardless of the severity of multidimensionality. The conclusion was that, although content classification, affecting dimensional structure during test assembly, might not be a serious concern for unidimensional ability estimation and routing decisions for CAST with multidimensional data, it played a significant role in the accuracy of pass-fail decisions.

AB  - In recent years, comparisons between computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and paper-and-pencil tests (P&Ps) have focused less on equivalency and more on the construct validity of shifting between the modalities. Examinee motivation is one area of concern, including test and computer anxiety. One type of motivation, flow, has a characteristic pattern of development similar to the pattern of item selection in CAT. Flow theory posits that positive reinforcement is gained through the sensation of achieving optimal performance. This study attempts to determine whether CAT facilitates flow in examinees, enabling them to perform better than on P&Ps. Covariates like test and computer anxiety, academic achievement, and certain personality traits are taken into account. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 94 middle-school CAT examinees to 65 middle-school P&P examinees on their responses to the Flow State Scale 2 (FSS-2), and regression modeling revealed a significant interaction between test modality and test anxiety on state flow, and significant effects for trait flow, typical study time, gender, and ethnicity when controlling for other covariates. Significant effects on specific flow dimensions were also found. The effect of flow on test performance was examined, but may have been limited by sample size. Reliability and dimensionality was confirmed for several instruments, some for the first time with an adolescent population: FSS-2, the Dispositional Flow Scale 2, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Test Anxiety Inventory-Short Form, and the Computer Attitude Scale. Interviews with students were also conducted to confirm the validity of measuring flow in testing situations. Implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - This thesis addresses three aspects of movement, performance and perception in music performance. First, the playing of an accent, a simple but much used and practiced element in drumming is studied, second, the perception of gradually changing tempo, and third, the perception and communication of specific emotional intentions through movements during music performance. Papers I and II investigated the execution and interpretation of an accent in drumming, performed under different playing conditions. Players' movements, striking velocities and timing patterns were studied for different tempi, dynamic levels and striking surfaces. It was found that the players used differing movement strategies and that interpreted the accent differently, reflected in their movement trajectories. Strokes at higher dynamic levels were played from a greater average height and with higher striking velocities. All players initiated the accented strokes from a greater height, and delivered the accent with increased striking velocity compared to the unaccented strokes. The interval beginning with the accented stroke was also prolonged, generally by delaying the following stroke. Recurrent cyclic patterns were found in the players' timing performances. In a listening test, listeners perceived grouping of the strokes according to the cyclic patterns. Paper III concerned the perception of gradual tempo changes in auditory sequences. Using an adaptive test procedure subjects judged stimuli consisting of click sequences with either increasing or decreasing tempo, respectively. Each experiment included three test sessions at different nominal tempi (80, 120, and 180 beats per minute). The results showed that ten of the eleven subjects showed an inherent bias in their perception of tempo drift. The direction and magnitude of the bias was consistent between test sessions but varied between individuals. The just noticeable differences for tempo drift agreed well with the estimated tempo drifts in production data, but were much smaller than earlier reported thresholds for tempo drift. Paper IV studied how emotional intent in music performances is conveyed to observers through the movements of the musicians. Three players of marimba, bassoon, and saxophone respectively, were filmed when playing with the expressive intentions Happiness, Sadness, Anger and Fear. Observers rated the emotional content and movement cues in the videos clips shown without sound. The results showed that the observers were able to identify the intentions Sadness, Anger, and Happiness, but not Fear. The rated movement cues showed that an Angry performance was characterized by jerky movements, Happy performances by large, and somewhat fast and jerky movements, and Sad performances by slow, and smooth movements.

AB  - The McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ - SF) is a measure of pain published in 1987. This dissertation conducts a confirmatory factor analysis of the measure's structure, as well as a calibration of the items on the measure, using Item Response Theory. A total of 1185 patients reporting to two chronic pain care treatment centers completed the MPQ - SF in the course of their admission to treatment. Factor analyses of their data suggests a three-factor solution of â€œacute,â€ â€œemotional,â€ and â€œsorenessâ€ factors led to a higher order factor of â€œpain.â€ This solution provides an adequate fit for the data. Previously published one and two factor structures did not demonstrate adequate fit in this data set. Unidimensionality in this sample was supported by the presence of a higher order factor of â€œPain.â€ Items on the measure are calibrated using the two-parameter logistic model. Specifically, item slope and location parameters are calculated for each of the items, and differential item functioning is investigated between four subgroups of data. Performance on the items was contrasted between subgroups differing on gender, pain diagnosis, workers' compensation status and pain coping status using Raju's DFIT methodology. No differential test functioning was found; however, some individual items did display differential item functioning by subgroup. Sample characteristics that contribute to differential item functioning are examined further. Additionally, implications for diagnostic considerations and computer adaptive testing are discussed.

AB  - Computer-based testing is becoming popular with credentialing agencies because new test designs are possible and the evidence is clear that these new designs can increase the reliability and validity of candidate scores and pass/fail decisions. Research on MST to date suggests that the measurement quality of MST results is comparable to full-fledged computer-adaptive tests and improved over computerized fixed-form tests. MST's promise dwells in this potential for improved measurement with greater control than other adaptive approaches for constructing test forms. Recommending use of the MST design and advising how best to set up the design, however, are two different things. The purpose of the current simulation study was to advance an established line of research on MST methodology by enhancing understanding of how several important design variables affect outcomes for high-stakes credentialing. Modeling of the item bank, the candidate population, and the statistical characteristics of test items reflect an operational credentialing exam's conditions. Studied variables were module arrangement (4 designs), amount of overall test information (4 levels), distribution of information over stages (2 variations), strategies for between-stage routing (4 levels), and pass rates (3 levels), for 384 conditions total. Results showed that high levels of decision accuracy (DA) and decision consistency (DC) were consistently observed, even when test information was reduced by as much as 25%. No differences due to the choice of module arrangement were found. With high overall test information, results were optimal when test information was divided equally among stages; with reduced test information gathering more test information at Stage 1 provided the best results. Generalizing simulation study findings is always problematic. In practice, psychometric models never completely explain candidate performance, and with MST, there is always the potential psychological impact on candidates if test difficulty shifts are noticed. At the same time, two findings seem to stand out in this research: (1)<c2><a0>with limited amounts of overall test information, it may be best to capitalize on available information with accurate branching decisions early, and (2)<c2><a0>there may be little statistical advantage in exceeding test information much above 10 as gains in reliability and validity appear minimal.

AB  - Differential item functioning (DIF) is an important issue in large scale standardized testing. DIF refers to the unexpected difference in item performances among groups of equally proficient examinees, usually classified by ethnicity or gender. Its presence could seriously affect the validity of inferences drawn from a test. Various statistical methods have been proposed to detect and estimate DIF. This dissertation addresses DIF analysis in the context of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whose item selection algorithm adapts to the ability level of each individual examinee. In a CAT, a DIF item may be more consequential and more detrimental be cause fewer items are administered in a CAT than in a traditional paper-and-pencil test and because the remaining sequence of items presented to examinees depends in part on their responses to the DIF item. Consequently, an efficient, stable and flexible method to detect and estimate CAT DIF becomes necessary and increasingly important. We propose simultaneous implementations of online calibration and DIF testing. The idea is to perform online calibration of an item of interest separately in the focal and reference groups. Under any specific parametric IRT model, we can use the (online) estimated latent traits as covariates and fit a nonlinear regression model to each of the two groups. Because of the use of the estimated, not the true &thetas;, the regression fit has to adjust for the covariate â€œmeasurement errorsâ€. It turns out that this situation fits nicely into the framework of nonlinear error-in-variable modelling, which has been extensively studied in statistical literature. We develop two bias-correction methods using asymptotic expansion and conditional score theory. After correcting the bias caused by measurement error, one can perform a significance test to detect DIF with the parameter estimates for different groups. This dissertation also discusses some general techniques to handle measurement error modelling with different IRT models, including the three-parameter normal ogive model and polytomous response models. Several methods of estimating DIF are studied as well. Large sample properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies show that the resulting methods perform well in terms of Type-I error rate control, accuracy in estimating DIF and power against both unidirectional and crossing DIF.

AB  - This study describes the effects of manipulating item difficulty in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment. There are many potential benefits when using CATS as compared to traditional tests. These include increased security, shorter tests, and more precise measurement. According to IRT, the theory underlying CAT, as the computer continually recalculates ability, items that match that current estimate of ability are administered. Such items provide maximum information about examinees during the test. Herein, however, lies a potential problem. These optimal CAT items result in an examinee having only a 50% chance of a correct response. Some examinees may consider such items unduly challenging. Further, when test anxiety is a factor, it is possible that test scores may be negatively affected. This research was undertaken to determine the effects of administering easier CAT items on ability estimation and test length using computer simulations. Also considered was the administration of different numbers of initial items prior to the start of the adaptive portion of the test, using three different levels of measurement precision. Results indicate that regardless of the number of initial items administered, the level of precision employed, or the modifications made to item difficulty, the approximation of estimated ability to true ability is good in all cases. Additionally, the standard deviations of the ability estimates closely approximate the theoretical levels of precision used as stopping rules for the simulated CATs. Since optimal CAT items are not used, each item administered provides less information about examinees than optimal CAT items. This results in longer tests. Fortunately, using easier items that provide up to a 66.4% chance of a correct response results in tests that only modestly increase in length, across levels of precision. For larger standard errors, even easier items (up to a 73.5% chance of a correct response) result in only negligible to modest increases in test length. Examinees who find optimal CAT items difficult or examinees with test anxiety may find CATs that implement easier items enhance the already existing benefits of CAT.

AB  - To satisfy the security requirements of computerized adaptive tests (CATs), efforts have been made to control the exposure rates of optimal items directly by incorporating statistical methods into the item selection procedure. Since differences are likely to occur between the exposure control parameter derivation stage and the operational CAT administrations, the exposure control methods may not fully accomplish the goal of controlling item exposure. This study explored the effects of the distribution changes on the performance of the Sympson and Hetter (SH) (J. Sympson and R. Hetter, 1985) and the Davey and Parshall (DP) (T. Davey and C. Parshall, 1995) procedures and provided an examination of the assertion that the Stocking and Lewis (M. Stocking and C. Lewis, 1998) conditional multinomial (SLC) procedure would function independently of an real examinee population. Simulations were carried out for this study using various combinations of the intended and real ability distributions. The results show that the changes in the examinees' ability distribution affected both SH and DP procedures in their control of the observed maximum exposure rates, and the effects were more profound for the SH method. The performance of the SLC method was demonstrated to be independent of the examinee's ability distributions in the operational CAT administrations. Contains 19 references, 5 tables, and 4 figures.

AB  - Computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) is quickly becoming the test mode of choice among many high-stakes testing agencies. Although some researchers suggest that CAT is comparable, if not better, than traditional paper-and-pencil testing, others have suggested that individual differences among examinees have not been fully explored. In particular, the additional cognitive demands imposed by CAT are not well understood. For example, in the CAT mode there is the added demand of moving back and forth from computer screen to scrap paper when one has to solve more complex problems. In traditional paper and-pencil (P&P) testing environments, there is but one mode with which to contend: paper-and-pencil. In addition, CAT may generate greater anxiety<e2><80><94>which further increases cognitive load<e2><80><94>among some test-takers than would be found with more traditional testing modes. For example, with CAT you cannot go back to review previous items or change previous answers. And CAT requires something that is anxiety provoking in and of itself for some individuals: use of a computer. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects, particularly the cognitive effects, of different testing environments on individual test-taker experience. Forty undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions: CAT mode or P&P testing mode. All subjects took the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination. Methodology for the study included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil instruments, videotaped recording of subject behavior, observation, and interview. Verbal protocol analysis of subsamples of subjects' work-toward-solution behavior on two analytical reasoning problems was also included. Results of multivariate and univariate analyses suggest significant differences across test mode, with respect to cognitive demands. Compared to subjects in the paper-and-pencil test mode, CAT subjects had significantly longer response times on analytical reasoning (AR) problems, relied more on scrap paper to model AR problems diagrammatically, and employed different problem-solving strategies. Differences in affective responses<e2><80><94>including anxiety and frustration<e2><80><94>further suggest test mode effects were present. CAT subjects expressed significantly more frustration with the test mode than did their P&P counterparts. Furthermore, CAT subjects with low computer confidence experienced significantly higher levels of test anxiety than did their more computer-confident peers. Implications for test developers and recommendations for further research are offered.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained increased popularity during the last decades. Consequently, admissions tests such as the GRE, the TOEFL, as well as other certification and licensure exams have been transformed from their paper-and-pencil versions to computerized adaptive versions. However, a major difference between the two test formats, from an examinee's point of view, is that examinees are usually not allowed to revise their answers on CATs. Some researchers feel that the validity of a CAT can increase with item review, since it allows them to rethink their answers and make corrections to items that have been misread or miskeyed. Other researchers believe that item review can decrease the efficiency and validity of a CAT since item review allows examinees to cheat on the test. The purpose of this study was to test the efficiency of a <e2><80><98> rearrangement procedure<e2><80><99> that rearranges and skips certain items in order to better estimate the examinees' abilities. This was examined through a simulation study. This rearrangement procedure permits examinees to change their answers on a CAT without allowing them to artificially inflate their test scores. If this procedure were adopted, it could help reduce the stress of examinees who feel that they have more control over the testing situation when they can revise their answers. This procedure could also help improve the reliability and validity of the CAT since errors due to misread and miskeyed answers would be corrected. The results of this simulation study have shown that when the Maximum Likelihood estimation was used, the rearrangement procedure was effective in reducing the bias of the ability estimates. With the Bayesian estimation, the rearrangement procedure increased the reliability, and slightly decreased the standard error of the estimates. However, the Bayesian method was not effective in reducing the bias of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure. There were not many differences in the accuracy of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure, when three or five items were reviewed. There were also very small differences in the effects that the item pool size had on the accuracy of the ability estimates after the rearrangement procedure.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly using novel tools (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in designing selection systems. While there is great interest in using these tools, there is little research to indicate how applicants react to them. As applicant reactions have been shown to affect a number of variables important to organizations (e.g., test fairness, job acceptance, productivity, recommendation intentions), it is important to understand what determines these reactions. A framework was developed to highlight a number of antecedents to, types of, and consequences of reactions to novel testing. The current study has a 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil - computerized) x 2 (perceived technical level of the job: high technical job - low technical job) x 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design. While test-takers' post-test perceptions do not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, factors such as computer anxiety and experience were shown to be important factors in determining success in the selection process. Results show the significant relationships between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing novel selection tools in an applicant setting.

AB  - This study represented a first attempt to evaluate the impact of local item dependence (LID) for Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The most basic CAT design and a simplified design for simulating CAT item pools with varying degrees of LID were applied. A data generation method that allows the LID among items to be defined was applied to generate five CAT item pools. The LID exhibited by these pools ranged from zero LID (complete local item independence) to extreme LID. Results indicate that for certain types of scoring an extreme amount of LID may adversely impact the final score obtained by the examinee. The estimated precision of the test was also affected by the extreme LID level studied here. For the medium level of LID, structured to display the amount of LID typically displayed by the Law School Admission Test, the effects of the LID were not troublesome.

AB  - This dissertation focused on the generation and evaluation of web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Memory and spatial visualization theory were explored in relation to the addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component. Analysis of the data determined that there was a significant difference between scores on the MRT Computer and MRT Memory test. The addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component did significantly affect results at the .05 alpha level. Reliability and discrimination estimates were higher on the MRT Memory version. The computerization of the paper and pencil version on the MRT did not significantly effect scores but did effect the time required to complete the test. The population utilized in the quasi-experiment consisted of 107 university students from eight institutions in engineering graphics related courses. The subjects completed two researcher developed, Web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the original paper and pencil version of the Mental Rotation Test. One version of the test included a visuo-spatial working memory loading. Significant contributions of this study included developing and evaluating computerized versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Previous versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test did not take advantage of the ability of the computer to incorporate an interaction factor, such as a visuo-spatial working memory loading, into the test. The addition of an interaction factor results in a more discriminate test which will lend itself well to computerized adaptive testing practices. Educators in engineering graphics related disciplines should strongly consider the use of spatial visualization tests to aid in establishing the effects of modern computer systems on fundamental design/drafting skills. Regular testing of spatial visualization skills will result assist in the creation of a more relevant curriculum. Computerized tests which are valid and reliable will assist in making this task feasible.

AB  - This study developed a model to simulate nonmodel-fitting responses in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment, and to examine the effectiveness of the model. The underlying idea was to simulate examinees' test behaviors realistically. This study simulated a situation in which examinees are exposed to or are coached on test items before actual testing. The multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) (M. Reckase, 1985) model was adopted for this study. Test characteristic curves and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were investigated. The results indicate that the probability of an examinee responding to an item correctly and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were influenced by the severity and the number of affected items. The results also suggest that the proposed model might be an effective tool for investigating the issue of nonmodel-fitting responses in a CAT environment. (Contains 7 figures and 39 references.)

AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an item response theory (IRT). Additionally this study examined the effect of repeated practice with ACCUPLACER on subsequent ACCUPLACER and COMPASS scores. General opinions of students toward ACCUPLACER and COMPASS and correlations between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and paper-and-pencil (P&P) formats were investigated. Methods. The investigator sampled 517 ACCUPLACER tests in order to develop a large number of response patterns and scores. This data source was used to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers and consistency between item response patterns and test scores in ACCUPLACER. This study employed seven classes of developmental mathematics; specifically, three classes were the experimental group and four classes comprised the control group. As treatment, students from the experimental group practiced the ACCUPLACER four times during the quarter. Students from all seven classes took the preACCUPLACER, postACCUPLACER, preCOMPANION, postCOMPANION, postCOMPASS, and Developmental Final Examinations. All students responded to the Opinionnaires of the ACCUPLACER and COMPASS. Scores on SAT-Math, SAT-Verbal, and Collegiate Placement Examination were obtained from students' records. Results. Test questions generated from all correct responses and test questions generated from all incorrect responses were disjoint. Starter questions were found to be moderately easy rather than average difficulty. Six of the twelve items were identical and appeared in the same position on many initially correct response patterns. Lower scores came from initially incorrect response patterns. Scores varied greatly within the same response pattern when different sequences of items were given. A total of 108 different items were found, not the expected 214 items. Several starter questions appeared as later items in tests with primarily incorrect responses. Some correlations between CAT and P&P formats were significant $(p < .05).$ Students found that instructions and graphics were unclear on CATs. Conclusions. The results of this study are not consistent with five of the purported claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an IRT framework. Several sets of scores within the same response pattern widely varied. Repeated practice on a CAT did not affect subsequent CAT scores. Correlations between CAT and P&P formats indicate that one format of testing is not a good predictor of the other form of testing. Remedial students find CATs difficult to understand.

PB  - The University of Iowa
CY  - United States -- Iowa
AB  - This study investigated and compared the properties of five methods of item exposure control within the purview of estimating examinees' abilities in a CAT context. Simulations were used to carry out this research. The item pools were constructed based on item parameters calibrated from the existing paper-and-pencil ACT Assessment Mathematics Test. Each of the exposure control algorithms was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed according to the CAT design established for this study. The merits and shortcomings of these strategies were considered under two item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of item security, test overlap rates, pool utilization, and the conditional standard errors of measurement, bias, and root mean squared errors. The general observations revealed that the randomization technique did not better ensure item security to any noticeable extent than the procedure without exposure control. The Sympson and Hetter and the Stocking and Lewis unconditional multinomial procedures produced very similar results under all conditions. However, when developing the exposure control parameters, the Sympson and Hetter method was much more efficient. The results yielded by the Davey and Parshall procedure were in general favorable. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates, but this came at the price of decreases in precision due to the strict control of item exposure. The performance of the various methods was affected differentially by the size of the item pool. Also, the comparative properties of the various methods were not consistent under the two desired exposure rate conditions. These differential effects might be attributed to the specific features of the algorithms in combination with the structure of the item pool. Each method had its advantages and disadvantages, but none possessed all desired characteristics. There was a clear and logical trade-off between exposure control and measurement precision. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure, and to a slightly lesser extent, the Davey and Parshall method seemed to be the most promising considering all factors this study addressed.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well academic, demographic, and programmatic variables could explain and predict variation in graduate performance on NCLEX-RN in one baccalaureate nursing program. The study specifically sought to address the void in empirical research in the area of programmatic variables predictive of NCLEX-RN performance. The study also investigated whether the changes made in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to computer adaptive testing (CAT), which was initiated in 1994, could help explain variations experience in program pass rate between 1990 and 1996. The population was composed of 360 May and June graduates from one baccalaureate nursing program. The research method used in this study was an archival survey. Analysis of t-tests and z-tests showed that the two outcome groups (pass group and fail group) differed significantly (p $<$.05) in terms of gender and ethnicity. Moreover, the two groups differed significantly in terms of many academic variables (ACT Composite score; admission, freshman, sophomore, junior, cumulative, nursing and science GPA's; and number of nursing and support courses repeated). In the final logistic regression model, four of the independent variables; gender (SEX), nursing GPA, number of nursing and support courses repeated (REPEAT), and the mean educational level of the clinical nursing faculty (C-ED), were found to be significant predictors of NCLEX-RN performance (p $<$.05; one-tailed probability). The author concluded that male and minority students, and student who have repeated nursing and support courses, are at risk for failure on NCLEX-RN. Additionally, because the education of the clinical faculty proved to affect graduate odds for success on NCLEX-RN, it was recommended that programs strive to attract, recruit, and retain highly qualified clinical faculty. When added to the regression equation, the version of the NCLEX-RN did not prove to be statistically significant. The researcher concluded, therefore, that the change in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to CAT did not contribute to the variations in the NCLEX-RN pass rate experienced by this nursing program.

AB  - Procedures based on item response theory (IRT) are widely accepted for solving various measurement problems which cannot be solved using classical test theory (CTT) procedures. The desirable features of dichotomous IRT models over CTT are well known and have been documented by Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991). However, dichotomous IRT models are inappropriate for situations where items need to be scored in more than two categories. For example, in performance assessments, most of the scoring rubrics for performance assessment require scoring of examinee's responses in ordered categories. In addition, polytomous IRT models are useful for assessing an examinee's partial knowledge or levels of mastery. However, the successful application of polytomous IRT models to practical situations depends on the availability of reasonable and well-behaved estimates of the parameters of the models. Therefore, in this study, the behavior of estimators of parameters in polytomous IRT models were examined. In the first study, factors that affected the accuracy, variance, and bias of the marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimators in the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) were investigated. Overall, the results of the study showed that the MML estimators of the parameters of the GPCM, as obtained through the computer program, PARSCALE, performed well under various conditions. However, there was considerable bias in the estimates of the category parameters under all conditions investigated. The average bias did not decrease when sample size and test length increased. The bias contributed to large RMSE in the estimation of category parameters. Further studies need to be conducted to study the effect of bias in the estimates of parameters on the estimation of ability, the development of item banks, and on adaptive testing based on polytomous IRT models. In the second study, the effectiveness of Bayesian procedures for estimating parameters in the GPCM was examined. The results showed that Bayes procedures provided more accurate estimates of parameters with small data sets. Priors on the slope parameters, while having only a modest effect on the accuracy of estimation of slope parameters, had a very positive effect on the accuracy of estimation of the step difficulty parameters.

AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT.

AB  - In the past several years many statistical indices have been developed that attempt to quantify the extent to which responses to questions on a test fit the underlying test model. This area of research is commonly referred to as person fit. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a test administration procedure in which questions are selected from a pool of available questions depending on how an examinee has responded to previous test questions. Thus, within the CAT environment each examinee is administered a tailored or dynamic test that is unique compared to other examinees' tests. Previous researchers have not investigated the issue of person fit within the context of CAT. The present study was a monte carlo investigation that simulated nonmodel-fitting responses within the CAT environment under a variety of conditions. The independent variables in this investigation were (1) the number of nonmodel-fitting responses, (2) the location of the nonmodel-fitting responses, (3) the point in the CAT process at which testing terminated, and (4) the entry point used for the CAT. The dependent variables were (1) the number of questions administered, (2) accuracy of the estimates of examinees' location on the latent trait ability continuum ($\theta$), (3) each examinee's fit to the underlying model using the $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices, and (4) the distribution of $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices within the CAT environment. It was found that when several nonmodel-fitting responses occurred early in the CAT procedure (i.e., warm-up effect) the recovery of $\theta$ was very poor. When a warm-up effect was simulated, not only did test length increase but also more examinees were identified as not fitting the model. Using a standard error of less than.20 to terminate the CAT resulted in estimated $\theta$ values that were biased and poorly estimated. Finally, the entry point used in the CAT administration did not seem to affect final ability estimates. Future research should consider developing new indices to quantify the extent to which examinees fit the test model within the CAT environment, and new methods of simulated nonmodel-fitting response patterns within CAT.

AB  - Whether the presence of bidimensionality has any effect on the adaptive recalibration of test items was studied through live-data simulation of computer adaptive testing (CAT) forms. The source data were examinee responses to the 298 scored multiple choice items of a licensure examination in a health care profession. Three 75-item part-forms, differing in the degree of bidimensionality, were constructed from the examination forms. The dimensionality of each item was determined based on principal factor loadings using W. F. Stout's (1987) procedure. Samples of 2,100 examinees from an U.S.-educated group and a predominantly foreign-educated group were used, with samples sizes of 100, 200, 400, and 1,000 used for the analyses. As expected, an increase in sample size resulted in greater agreement between calibration and bank b-values. It appeared that dimensionality affected adaptive recalibration. Results from this study varied depending on the dimensionality of the part-forms. Results also affirm the importance of a well-defined reference group for recalibration, since samples from varying ability ranges sometimes produced considerably different b-values. Three tables present details of the analyses. (Contains six references.) (SLD)

AB  - While the psychometric and statistical models underlying the design of computer adaptive tests (CAT) are well understood, relatively few working models exist for the purpose of foreign language assessment. Likewise, little has been published concerning the practical considerations affecting the implementation of such tests. in the process of constructing the Monash/Melbourne French CAT, we discovered much about putting testing theory into practice. The present paper reports this experience in three parts. In a preliminary section, we describe the academic context in which the French CAT was created and trialed. This is followed by a detailed consideration of the test presentation platform and operating algorithms. Lastly, we give an evaluation of the first administration of the French CAT, accompanied by a discussion of the test's reliability and validity as a placement instrument for first year Australian university students.

AB  - The relationship between several individual difference variables and test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was studied with 208 South Korean college students. The general individual difference variable selected was test anxiety, and the math-related individual difference variables were mathematics aptitude, math test anxiety, and math self-concept. Computer-related individual difference variables were computer literacy, computer anxiety, and computer experience. The CAT was an algebra test. Test anxiety and other individual difference variables were measured with instruments translated into Korean for the study. The seven difference variables and their squares were submitted to an analysis using the RSQUARE Procedure from Statistical Analysis System software. Math aptitude, math self-concept, math test anxiety, and computer literacy, in that order, were significantly related to test performance using CAT, but test anxiety, computer experience, and computer anxiety were not. Results suggest that the relationship between individual difference variables and test performance using CAT may be curvilinear. Two tables present analysis results. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

TI  - Computerized Adaptive Testing Exploring Examinee Response Time Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling

EP  - 26
PY  - 1994
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - Educational technology has been a focus of development and research in science teaching and learning. This document reviews research dealing with computer and hypermedia applications to assessment in science education. The paper reports the findings first for computer applications for assessment and then for hypermedia applications in assessment. Computer applications include access to large test banks, evaluation of student data collected in laboratory exercises, microcomputer-administered diagnostic testing, effects of computer use on student motivation during computer-administered tests, and computerized adaptive testing. Hypermedia applications include interactive videodisc technology for teaching biology, assessing teachers' knowledge for certification purposes, problem-based learning in chemistry found in the "Hyperequation" project, and administering figural response test items to cell and molecular biology students. The summary describes three advantages for incorporating computer-assisted assessment: immediate student feedback, ease of test taking, and availability of another form of formative assessment. Users of computer-assisted assessment are cautioned that computer-generated tests can lull the teacher into simply testing low level recall knowledge, and that the linear nature of computer testing does not allow the student to go back and reflect upon particular items.

CY  - NA
AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

AB  - This dissertation examined the feasibility of using computer adaptive technology to administer certification examinations. The agenda for this research was (1) to compare a computer adaptive test (CAT) with paper and pencil (PAP) tests in terms of the comparability of item calibrations and the comparability of examinee ability estimates and (2) to examine the CAT under varying test conditions to determine whether modifications in traditional test design affect examinee performance. Results show that PAP item calibrations were functionally equivalent to the CAT item calibrations even though items on the CAT were administered to varying numbers of examinees and appeared in different contexts for different examinees. Examinees performed comparably on the CAT and the PAP as evidenced by a.83 correlation, adjusted for measurement error, and a mean difference of.01 across the two modes of administration. There were no significant differences between the CAT and the PAP ability estimates due to sex, ethnic origin, age or whether or not English was the examinee's first language. On the CAT, examinees were randomly placed in test design conditions in which the effects of altering the difficulty of the start, the difficulty of the test, the minimum test length and the option to skip, defer or review items were examined. There were no significant differences in examinee performance across these groups indicating that some of these design options may be viable for CAT. Test length was reduced on the CAT without sacrificing confidence in the pass/fail decision. Test length on the PAP was 109 items; mean test length on the CAT was 66 items when the maximum test length was set at 100 items and 86 items when the maximum test length was set at 240 items. Results from this study indicate that CAT can be an excellent way to administer certification exams. Examinees can benefit by being able to take shorter exams, scheduled at their convenience and receive immediate test results. For the certification board, CAT can improve data collection and test security, and provide greater confidence in pass/fail decisions.

TI  - The effect of adaptive testing item selection methods on the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

CY  - United States -- Pennsylvania
AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty. The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data. Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

TI  - Linguistic predictors of SAT antonym item difficulty: Identification and employment
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
VL  - NA
PY  - 1992
PB  - Boston College
CY  - United States -- Massachusetts
AB  - This research investigates the extent to which linguistic features of standardized test antonym items can be used to predict the empirical difficulty of these items. The study was motivated by both theoretical and practical considerations. Theoretically, exploring content-feature correlates of difficulty is a form of construct validation as such inquiry attends to the question of why an item is easy or difficult. The pursuit of evidential links between content and difficulty is a scientific, falsifiable approach to validation. In contrast, conventional response-based analyses do not address the central role played by item content in controlling difficulty. From a practical standpoint, detecting content-based predictors allows for the scaling of similarly constructed items without having to establish difficulty measurements via pretesting. Twelve variables associated with stem and keyed answer words of 975 published SAT antonym items are considered. Results reveal that the stem word's standard frequency index (SFI) is the most robust predictor of empirical difficulty (as measured by Educational Testing Service's equated delta statistic), distantly followed by the keyed answer word's SFI and part of speech. Across all items, one-third of difficulty variance was explained by this predictor set, confirming the frequency-difficulty relationship reported in studies employing more common words and smaller samples. Prediction was attenuated by the relatively high proportion of words having low frequencies. Presumably, a larger representation of familiar words and more differentiated low frequency values would significantly improve prediction. These findings suggest that feature-based scaling is an efficient, cost effective means for advancing local development of adaptive assessment systems. A computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system is suggested as one practical, psychometric application of the study's findings. The proposed system would extract verbal stimuli from an electronic word domain and employ the aforementioned word variables as proxies for vocabulary item difficulty. Among the design issues discussed are the automatic construction of vocabulary items, adaptive branching, sequential decision-making, iterative refinement of item calibrations, and the provision of timely output for formative direction of learning and instruction.

TI  - Loudness of quasi-continuous impulse noise
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

PB  - City University of New York
CY  - United States -- New York
AB  - The loudness of quasi continuous impulse noise has been studied as a function of impulse duration and repetition rate, and the spectral shape and relative level of steady background noise. The measurements were performed on 1-second trains of white-noise bursts with exponentially decaying envelopes. The repetition rates were 5 to 100 Hz. The impulse durations were adjusted so that the duty factor of the impulse train (product of the repetition rate and the effective duration of the impulses) varied from 0.025 to 0.1. Steady white background noise was added at peak-to-background ratios of 10, 20 and 30 dB. The loudness levels of the stimuli relative to a steady white noise reference stimulus at a presentation level of 60.5 dB L$\sb{\rm eq}$ were measured in ten normal-hearing subjects using an adaptive testing procedure. Under most conditions, the loudness levels of the quasi continuous impulse noise stimuli were best predicted by the equivalent sound pressure level, L$\sb{\rm eq}$, indicating that the "equal energy" relation was followed. At the 50 and 100-Hz repetition rates, the loudness level of the impulse noise test stimuli at the 20 and 30-dB peak-to-background ratios exceeded that of the reference stimulus due to the "roughness effect". The loudness levels of the stimuli at the lower repetition rates, on the other hand, was significantly less than the equal energy prediction at the shortest durations, which suggests that auditory temporal integration depends on the duty factor of the impulse train. The data of experiment 1 were fit by a simple model involving the duty factor of the impulse train and the difference between the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the impulsive component and the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the steady background noise component of the test stimuli. In the second experiment, the spectral shape of the background noise did not significantly affect the point of subjective equality. However, there was a significant interaction between background noise spectrum and peak-to-background noise ratio which was suggestive of a masking process.

AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

CY  - Canada -- Quebec, CA
AB  - Stress-strain curves, generated through continuous and multistage torsion tests of as-cast and homogenized 301, 304, 316 and 317 $\gamma$ stainless steels in the range of 1200-900$\sp\circ$C and 0.1 to 5.0 s$\sp{\rm -1}$, were analyzed with respect to the characteristics of work hardening, dynamic and static recovery, dynamic and static recrystallization, and ductility. Work hardening was related to the Kocks-Mecking analysis. The associated enthalpy which rose across the deformation range attaining a maximum at the highest temperature, was in close agreement with the constant activation energy determined by sinh analysis. Dynamic softening mechanisms were analyzed through examination of the flow curves, with conclusions based upon mechanical data being confirmed by optical metallographic methods. Upon attaining a critical strain, dynamic recrystallization DRX was initiated, producing a peak and then softening to a steady state regime. The rate of dynamic softening was determined by means of the Avrami equation. The critical stress and strain for subgrain formation and for DRX were determined from changes in slope of the strain hardening-flow stress $\theta$-$\sigma$ curves. A transition from multiple peak grain coarsening to single peak grain refinement behavior was observed and analyzed. Static restorative mechanisms were examined by mechanical metallographic methods. Fractional softening was due to both static recovery SRV and static recrystallization SRX. The kinetics were analyzed through use of the Avrami equation. At low strains, the time for 50% SRX was a strong function of strain to the $-2$ power. In addition, the temperature compensated time for SRX depended upon the three-eights power of the Zener-Hollomon parameter for both isothermal and declining temperature T multistage tests. Simulation of a cross country mill showed that multistage flow curves increased as strain rate rose and as interval time and T declined, particularly below 1050$\sp\circ$C. Since the time between successive planetary rolls is insufficient for any restorative mechanisms to operate, the instantaneous power requirements for the planetary hot rolling mill were determined from continuous flow curves. The results favorably agreed with similar mills installed in both Canada and Japan.

AB  - The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was evaluated for Item Response Theory (IRT) assumptions, local independence and parameter invariance in order to determine the feasibility of developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version. Three conditions were studied including two simulated CAT versions and a standard version (Form R). A sex difference was noted across all groups, but item order did not otherwise affect scores which were highly correlated with the IRT based scores. After excluding those items which did not fit the model, the local independence assumption generally held across groups, and since the procedure used to assess local independence was also sensitive to multidimensionality, this provides implied support for unidimensionality of the various scales. The procedures used to investigate item order effects and parameter invariance yielded mixed results. Overall, this study provides evidence favorable to a CAT adaptation of the MMPI, and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB  - The shear strength of remolded specimens of an unsaturated, silty, copper tailings sand was measured in a triaxial apparatus. Multistage tests were completed under consolidated-drained (CD) conditions, where both the pore air and pore water pressures were controlled, and under constant water content (CW) conditions, where the specimen was drained with respect to the pore air pressure and undrained with respect to the pore water pressure. A triaxial testing system with automatic data capturing capabilities was assembled for the study. A total of eight specimens were tested, two in a saturated condition and three each under unsaturated CD and CW conditions, respectively. The saturated specimens were staged with respect to increasing effective stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$), while each unsaturated specimen was tested with a constant value of net applied stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$), and increasing values of matric suction (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) from stage to stage. The range of net applied stress and matric suction studied was 15 to 150 kPa. The parameter $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ quantifies the increase in shear strength which can be attributed to the matric suction stress state variable. The results indicated that the intersection of the failure surface with the plane containing the (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) axis was curved over the range of suction studied, and did not differ appreciably between the CD and CW test methods. This demonstrated uniqueness of the failure surface. When account was made for a slight curvature in the failure surface in the direction of the ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$) axis, the variation in $\phi\sp\prime$ with respect to (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) was reduced. This supported the concept of independence of the shear strength parameters $\phi\sp\prime$, c$\sp\prime$, and $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ for unsaturated soils, and verified the form of the shear strength equation used in the study (Fredlund, Morgenstern, and Widger, 1978).

AB  - The major objective of this investigation was to test experimentally the relative validity of simulating hot strip rolling by compression testing at constant true strain rates under axisymmetric conditions. For the purpose of the simulation, the material's flow through the roll gap was theoretically modelled. Isothermal, single- and multi-stage compression tests were carried out on a microprocessor-controlled servohydraulic testing system by using a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel. Cylindrical specimens were subjected to deformation at rates of strain either constant or varying as during a rolling pass/passes. True stress-true strain flow curves were obtained by correcting the measured stress-strain data for the effect of friction at the specimen/die interface. The constant friction shear factor was determined quantitatively by hot ring tests. Optical microscopy was used to observe the prior austenite microstructures. Based on the results of single-stage, constant true strain-rate tests, the dependence of the flow strength as a function of strain, rate of strain and temperature was modelled by using an Arrhenius-type equation. The comparison of the responses of the material to the two types of compression revealed no significant differences between flow curves except at the very end of the tests. This observation agreed with the predictions of the model, which was developed based on the constant strain-rate flow curves, indicating that the material follows a mechanical equation of state in hot rolling processes. The flow curves and the average flow strengths were compared between the constant and varying strain-rate, four-stage tests. Differences were also found negligible. The variation of the average flow strength during multistage testing was dependent of the length of the interpass time and the average strain rate in a significant manner. It was found that the microstructures developed from single- as well as multi-stage compression tests were independent of the variation of the strain rate during deformation. This study showed that the constant true strain-rate compression testing is a very useful technique in simulating hot flat strip rolling processes.

AB  - This study focused on the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in remedial mathematics when compared with tutoring and independent-study as methods of instruction. In this investigation, the relationship between these three methods of instruction and the ethnicity of the subjects was explored. Results were measured by analyzing differences in achievement scores as measured by Computer Adaptive Testing and Comparative Guidance Placement. The results showed that there was a significant difference between minority and non-minorities for both tutoring and independent-study. Such differences are frequently encountered and are generally attributable to cultural differences or prior educational experiences, which may cause some minority students to experience emotional and value conflicts in the classroom. This could result in psychological defenses being called into play. No significant differences in test scores were apparent between minorities and non-minorities when using CAI as the method of instruction, indicating that CAI may not activate such defenses. Results also showed that minorities scored significantly higher in testing after using CAI as a method of instruction than after using tutoring or independent-study methods. This suggests that CAI, when used for remedial instruction in basic skills mathematics, reduces the frequently encountered differences in achievement between minorities and non-minorities. This supports the theory that CAI is multicultural and a value-neutral tool that can assist to alleviate some of these pre-existing problems, thereby enabling minority students to attain greater academic success.

AB  - The value of statistical research depends on valid comparisons which can usefully influence educational policy. Educational research needs to extend the measures of learning (such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress) through nationally-calibrated absolute measures and through computer-assisted and adaptive testing. Direct sampling by computer would make educational polls and national assessment faster and less expensive. A national bureau of educational standards might be founded to collect, coordinate, calibrate, archive, analyze, synthesize, and make available the data that is needed to improve educational productivity. Nine factors promoting efficiency and productivity of learning are classified in three broad categories: (1) student aptitude, including ability, development, and motivation; (2) instruction, including amount of time students engage in learning and quality of instructional experience; and (3) environmental factors, such as home climate, classroom social group, peer group, and television viewing. The tables in the appendix illustrate the effect of productivity factors on achievement revealed by quantitative syntheses carried out by a number of investigators in Australia, Canada and the United States during the past decade.

TI  - TEACHER AND STUDENT RESPONSES TO A SYSTEM FOR RATIONAL MEASUREMENT
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

PY  - 1985
PB  - The University of Chicago
CY  - United States -- Illinois
AB  - Feedback is a key element in the teaching/learning cycle. It tells teachers and students how they are progressing and how effective their instruction/learning has been. Despite the importance of feedback, it is rarely obtained in optimal ways and is poorly understood by teachers and students. The problem lies in ineffective methods of obtaining and utilizing feedback information. This study has attempted to define, implement, and determine the effects of a set of rational measurement practices. It is based on the premise that testing should be an integral part of teaching, providing information to students and teachers in an efficient and non-intrusive manner. The components for rational measurement include well-written item sets which communicate teachers'expectations to students, individualized selection of items, detailed comments on student answers, and reports portraying the changing relationship of students to items as instruction proceeds. The system utilizes a microcomputer programmed with an algorithm for Rasch measurement and adaptive testing. Nine classes participated in a study of the effectiveness of the system. After training, each teacher wrote item sets corresponding to two units. Qualitative data were gathered on teachers' use of measurement information for improving teaching practice. Teacher proficiency in writing items was measured. Students within classes were randomly assigned to four groups created by the crossing of a feedback factor and an item selection factor. Students were tested weekly with subsets of items from the set written by the teacher. Ability measures were obtained from each session to determine whether detailed feedback was effective in raising achievement. Attitude and anxiety data were collected at the beginning and end of each unit to assess whether adaptive item selection caused a more positive student reaction to testing. Data analysis showed that four teachers used the system to improve their teaching. Three teachers displayed positive verbal responses, but did not change practices. Two teachers did not use the measurement information. There was no discernible increase in item-writing proficiency. Analysis of student data showed a nonsignificant positive effect of detailed feedback on student achievement. No difference between selection or feedback groups was observed for any affective measures.

AB  - The object of this research programme was to investigate the stability of a silty clay under undrained repeated loading. Equipment has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading. This model can be used to predict pore pressures and failure for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils.

TI  - The Impact of Local Item Dependence on Computer Adaptive Testing Given Between and Within Testlet Adaptivity
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

PY  - 2022
PB  - University of Minnesota
CY  - United States -- Minnesota
AB  - In educational tests, a group of questions related to a shared stimulus is called a testlet (e.g., a reading passage with multiple related questions). Use of testlets is very common in educational tests. Additionally, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a mode of testing where the test forms are created in real time tailoring to the test taker's previous responses. CATs have gained popularity because they produce a more accurate test score estimate within a shorter time with fewer questions. In this dissertation, the performance of CAT with testlets was studied. Conditional independence is an essential assumption of Item Response Models. However, when testlets are used, item responses to the items in the same testlet may not be independent since these items are associated with a common stimulus. In this case, the conditional independence assumption is violated, and this violation can affect the entire performance of CAT and lead to inaccurate test scores. Common practice for testlet based CATs is to select a testlet adaptively and administer all the items bundled in the testlet. However, the accuracy and efficiency aspects of CAT may not be fully realized with this approach of adaptivity. To increase the accuracy and efficiency in testlet-based CATs, between and within testlet adaptivity was studied. Other manipulated variables were the level of adaptivity, different testlet/item selection approaches, latent trait estimation methods, test length/number of testlets, and magnitude of testlet dependence. The performances of testlet based CATs with various scenarios were evaluated descriptively by running a series of simulations. One of the important findings of the study is that not only between testlets but also within testlets adaptation improved the performance of the CAT for more accurate and precise estimation of the latent traits. The results will serve as a baseline for future research and practice.

AB  - Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) Scientific Standards and refined through factor analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI<e2><80><99>s psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth.Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI<e2><80><99>s structure and psychometric properties.Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences.Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

AB  - Recent developments in the dimensional assessment of personality functioning have made the implementation of latent measurement models increasingly attractive. In this study, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a well-established personality functioning instrument (the OPD Structure Questionnaire) to identify a unidimensional latent trait and to evaluate the feasibility of computer adaptive testing (CAT). We hypothesized that the use of IRT could reduce the test burden <e2><80><93> compared to a fixed short form <e2><80><93> while maintaining high precision over a wide range of the latent trait. The OPD-SQ was collected from 1235 patients in a psychosomatic clinic. IRT assumptions were fulfilled. A 9-factor model yielded sufficient fit and unidimensionality in exploratory factor analysis with bifactor rotation. Items were iteratively reduced, and a graded-response IRT model was fitted to the data. Simulations showed that a CAT with approximately 7 items was able to capture an OPD-SQ global severity score with an accuracy similar to that of a fixed 12-item short form. The final item bank and CAT yielded satisfactory content validity. Strong correlations with depression and anxiety replicated previous results on the OPD-SQ. We concluded that IRT applications could be useful to reduce the test burden of personality functioning instruments.

CY  - NA
AB  - <c2><a0> IMPORTANCE: Veterans from recent and past conflicts have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5. RESULTS: Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic screening and severity measurement are possible. [Author Abstract]

CY  - Arlington
AB  - Objective: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk assessments need to be validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of a highly efficient computerized adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among SGMY. Methods: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n = 1,073) and at their follow-up visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity were performed. Results: Younger, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual (e.g., bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender nonconforming or nongender binary (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior wave. Conclusions: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for the identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual, and gender nonconforming or nongender binary.

AB  - In recent decades, computerized multistage testing (MST) has been utilized as an alternative testing mode for large-scale testing programs. Although the usage of MST has been discussed extensively, there is little literature that addresses its psychometric properties. The motivation of this dissertation arises from the need to properly estimate psychometric properties under the MST framework. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrated set of formulas for estimating psychometric properties for MST, including error variance, reliability, and classification indices. To achieve this goal, existing methods that are used for the traditional P\&P tests are extended to the MST context, if possible; and new methods are proposed based on the characteristics of MST (i.e., routing probability) for the ML and EAP estimators. For the ML estimator, a conventional approach to computing MST test information analytically is also included for estimating the psychometric properties. The proposed approach and the conventional approach are then applied to a single set of MST data, with varied conditions. Further, a simulation approach is employed for the purpose of understanding and comparing the performance of the proposed approach and conventional approach. In the simulation approach, replications of test data are used to obtain results. The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) for the ML estimator, the proposed analytic approach performed better than the conventional approach, indicated by comparing their results with those from the simulation approach; (2) for the EAP estimator, results from using the Bayesian approach approach led to smaller values of marginal error variances and higher values of reliability, compared with the quadrature approach; (3) longer test resulted in decreased error variances and improved reliability; (4) for the EAP Bayesian approach, increasing sample size had a limited impact on the estimation results; (5) for all the approaches, conditional classification consistency and accuracy gradually decreased when the ability parameter was moving further away from the cut scores. All of the estimation formulas provided in this dissertation can be applied directly to MST data in practice.

AB  - Background: There is a need for shorter-length assessments that capture patient questionnaire data while attaining high data quality without an undue response burden on patients. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods have the potential to meet these needs and can offer attractive options to shorten questionnaire lengths. Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT or CART was best suited to reduce the number of questionnaire items in multiple domains (eg, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and social support) used for a needs assessment procedure (NAP) within the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) without the loss of data quality. Methods: NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a Web-based portal, MyCARDSS, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results: With CAT and CART, an overall reduction of 36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length, respectively, was achieved, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT, 0.777 and 0.877 for classification trees, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees, respectively. Conclusions: Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the NAP used within the field of CR. CART, however, showed the best performance, with a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress in multiple domains. For CR professionals, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their patients by providing real-time patient measurements.

AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD.

AB  - Concussion is an increasingly recognized public health concern. Proper assessment and management of concussion are critical factors in mitigating adverse effects associated with this injury. Neuropsychological assessment has demonstrated utility in identifying cognitive symptoms related to concussion and monitoring their resolution. Early methods involved administering paper and pencil tests to appraise cognitive domains thought to be most affected by concussion. As interest in concussion and methods of assessment evolved, baseline testing became an integral component of assessment in sport-related concussion (SRC). Baseline testing consists of administering a healthy, or non-injured, individual a battery of cognitive tests that subsequently serve as a reference point to evaluate the individual<e2><80><99>s performance on the same tests following a suspected injury or change in cognitive status. Recent advances, spurred by an interest in increasing access to baseline testing, contributed to the adoption of computerized neurocognitive tests (CNTs). CNTs allow for baseline testing of groups of individuals, in one setting, and in a short amount of time. Immediate Post Concussion and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) has emerged as the most commonly used CNT in the assessment and management of SRC. This body of research aimed to explore ImPACT<e2><80><99>s reliability and validity to appraise its efficacy in accurately detecting cognitive change associated with concussion and explore potential improvements. The first chapter is devoted to examining ImPACT<e2><80><99>s test-retest reliability, which refers to the expected consistency in results over time in healthy individuals. This study examines ImPACT score reports for 107 healthy individuals that included testing at two time points. Results reveal less than adequate test-retest reliability attributable to, at least in part, a restricted range of possible scores, or the presence of a ceiling effect, on numerous subscales. Additional discussion includes corrective measures, such as proactively identifying individuals producing maximum scores on baseline testing, extending the length of subscales, and incorporating adaptive testing. The second chapter evaluates ImPACT<e2><80><99>s validity, and specifically, its classification accuracy in differentiating between individuals with and without concussion. This study incorporates a novel approach through its use of standardized regression based (SRB) reliable change index (RCI) scores to measure post-injury testing deviations from baseline scores. The SRB methodology, coupled with discriminant function analyses (DFAs), is compared to current interpretive procedures. The study includes 129 individuals without concussion whose SRB RCI scores are compared to 81 individuals with concussion. Results of analyses suggest that the current interpretive procedure performs at a chance level in accurately identifying individuals with concussion; conversely, the SRB method and DFA approach yield positive predictive values exceeding 80%, however sensitivities below 50%. Additionally, the Post Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), a self-report measure of symptoms, is largely equivalent to ImPACT<e2><80><99>s cognitive measures in classification accuracy. Collectively, these results raise considerable concern regarding ImPACT<e2><80><99>s efficacy as a measure to aid in the assessment and management of concussion.

AB  - Objective:To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test.Design:This is a psychometric study.Setting:The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany.Subjects:A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study.Interventions:Not applicable.Main measures:The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients.Results:The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item<e2><80><93>trait interaction (<cf><87>2(203)<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>172.59; P<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>.94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits).Conclusion:The unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

AB  - Background Quality of life (QoL) assessments, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), are becoming increasingly important in health care and have been associated with improved decision making, higher satisfaction, and better outcomes of care. Some physicians and patients may find questionnaires too burdensome; however, this issue could be addressed by making use of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In addition, making the questionnaire more interesting, for example by providing graphical and contextualized feedback, may further improve the experience of the users. However, little is known about how shorter assessments and feedback impact user experience. Objective We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the impact of tailored multimodal feedback and CAT on user experience in QoL assessment using validated PROMs. Methods We recruited a representative sample from the general population in the United Kingdom using the Oxford Prolific academic Web panel. Participants completed either a CAT version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-CAT) or the fixed-length WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100. We randomly assigned participants to conditions in which they would receive no feedback, graphical feedback only, or graphical and adaptive text-based feedback. Participants rated the assessment in terms of perceived acceptability, engagement, clarity, and accuracy. Results We included 1386 participants in our analysis. Assessment experience was improved when graphical and tailored text-based feedback was provided along with PROMs (<ce><94>=0.22, P<.001). Providing graphical feedback alone was weakly associated with improvement in overall experience (<ce><94>=0.10, P=.006). Graphical and text-based feedback made the questionnaire more interesting, and users were more likely to report they would share the results with a physician or family member (<ce><94>=0.17, P<.001, and <ce><94>=0.17, P<.001, respectively). No difference was found in perceived accuracy of the graphical feedback scores of the WHOQOL-CAT and WHOQOL-BREF (<ce><94>=0.06, P=.05). CAT (stopping rule [SE<0.45]) resulted in the administration of 25% fewer items than the fixed-length assessment, but it did not result in an improved user experience (P=.21). Conclusions Using tailored text-based feedback to contextualize numeric scores maximized the acceptability of electronic QoL assessment. Improving user experience may increase response rates and reduce attrition in research and clinical use of PROMs. In this study, CAT administration was associated with a modest decrease in assessment length but did not improve user experience. Patient-perceived accuracy of feedback was equivalent when comparing CAT with fixed-length assessment. Fixed-length forms are already generally acceptable to respondents; however, CAT might have an advantage over longer questionnaires that would be considered burdensome. Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between assessment length, feedback, and response burden in diverse populations.

AB  - Objective: This study outlined the implementation and feasibility of delivering PROMIS<c2><ae> computer adaptive tests (CATs) using a web-based method to evaluate the impact of a technological adaptation of Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) on the psychosocial functioning of men with advanced prostate cancer (APC) undergoing hormone therapy. Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS<c2><ae> computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS<c2><ae> CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS<c2><ae> domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS<c2><ae> anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS<c2><ae> CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

AB  - Background:Legacy hip outcome measures may be burdensome to patients and sometimes yield floor or ceiling effects. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) allow for low-burden data capture and limited ceiling and floor effects.Purpose/Hypothesis:The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PROMIS CAT domains demonstrate correlation against commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The authors hypothesized the following: (1) PROMIS CAT scores based on physical function (PF), pain interference (PIF), pain behavior, and pain intensity would show strong correlation with the following legacy scores: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), International Hip Outcome Tool<e2><80><93>12 (iHOT-12), Hip Outcome Score (HOS) Sports and Activities of Daily Living subscales, and Veterans RAND<e2><80><93>6D (VR-6D) utility measure. (2) The mental and physical health portions of the VR-6D legacy measure would show weak correlation with mental- and psychosocial-specific PROMIS elements<e2><80><94>depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. (3) All PROMIS measures would exhibit fewer floor and ceiling effects than legacy scores.Study Design:Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Prospective data were collected on 125 patients in the hip preservation clinics. Enrollees completed legacy scores (visual analog scale for pain, mHHS, iHOT-12, HOS, and VR-6D) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (PF, PIF, pain behavior, anxiety, depression, sleep, social roles and activities, pain intensity, fatigue). Spearman rank correlations were calculated, with rs values of 0 to 0.3 indicating negligible correlation; 0.3 to 0.5, weak correlation; 0.5 to 0.7, moderately strong correlation; and >0.7, strong correlation. Floor and ceiling effects were evaluated.Results:As anticipated, the PF-CAT yielded strong correlations with the iHOT-12, mHHS, HOS<e2><80><93>Sports, HOS<e2><80><93>Activities of Daily Living, and VR-6D, with rs values of 0.76, 0.71, 0.81, 0.87, and 0.71, respectively. The PIF-CAT was the only pain score to show moderately strong to strong correlation with all 14 patient-reported outcome measures. A strong correlation was observed between the VR-6D and the social roles and activities CAT (rs = 0.73). The depression CAT had a significant floor effect at 19%. No additional floor or ceiling effect was present for any other legacy or PROMIS measure.Conclusion:The PF-CAT shows strong correlation with legacy patient-reported outcome scores among patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The PIF-CAT also correlates strongly with legacy and PROMIS measures evaluating physical and mental well-being. PROMIS measures are less burdensome and demonstrate no floor or ceiling effects, making them a potential alternative to legacy patient-reported outcome measures for the hip.

AB  - This study investigates the performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF procedures independently and in comparative terms in a computerized multistage testing (MST) environment. A simulation study was conducted to mimic an operational testing environment. Three factors that may typically affect DIF detection in an MST environment were manipulated <e2><80><93> sample size (250, 500), impact (0, 0.5, 1) and DIF magnitude (0.45, 0.9). A fourth factor (DIF method) was included at the analysis stage to understand its effect on the outcomes. The criteria for evaluating the results were Type I error rates and power rates. Results reveal that MH has better control of Type I error rates across various study conditions. With respect to power, MH was more powerful in detecting large DIF for the large sample size condition (power rate of 1.00) compared to CATSIB, which had power rates between .84 and 1.00 under the same conditions. Regression results reveal that there were interaction effects of the study factors on Type I error rates and power rates. These results will guide practitioners on best practices regarding DIF detection procedures under various conditions in computerized MST environments. This research adds to the extant literature that promotes psychometric methods that can assist in ensuring that operational test scores are aligned with the principals of item-level statistical fairness.

AB  - Skeptics of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trend for International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) argue that while US elementary and high school students are behind their peers in other nations, the US workforce is still excellent because of the high quality post-secondary educational institutions in the US. However, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) indicates that US adults are in fact far behind their international peers in literacy, numeracy, and technology-based problem solving. Through the use of data mining, this study explored the possible association between PIAAC scores and several constructs. Since the US, Canada, and New Zealand were considered culturally similar nations, according to cluster analysis, patterns between PIAAC scores and selected constructs were analyzed by a variety of big data analytical methods, including cluster analysis, bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and data visualization. Given that PIAAC used multiple computerized adaptive testing, the consequential plausible values were randomly selected when the ensemble approach was used. Additionally, model comparison was utilized to decide between bagging and boosting in order to select the optimal model for each sample. In these samples, cultural engagement, readiness to learn, and social trust, respectively emerged as strong predictors for learning outcomes as they were assessed by PIAAC.

TI  - Optimizing Design of Incorporating Off-Grade Items for Constrained Computerized Adaptive Testing in K-12 Assessment
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

CY  - United States -- Iowa
AB  - Incorporating off-grade items within an on-grade item pool is often seen in K-12 testing programs. Incorporating off-grade items may provide improvements in measurement precision, test length, and content blueprint fulfillment, especially for high- and low-performing examinees, but it may also identify some concerns when using too many off-grade items on tests that are primarily designed to measure grade-level standards. This dissertation investigates how practical constraints such as the number of on-grade items, the proportion, and range of off-grade items, and the stopping rules affect item pool characteristics and item pool performance in adaptive testing.This study includes simulation conditions with four study factors: (1) three on-grade pool sizes (150, 300, and 500 items), (2) three proportions of off-grade items in the item pool (small, moderate, and large), (3) two ranges of off-grade items (one grade level and two grade levels), and (4) two stopping rules (variable- and fixed-length stopping rule) with two SE threshold levels. All the results are averaged across 200 replications for each simulation condition.The item pool characteristics are summarized using descriptive statistics and histograms of item difficulty (the b-parameters), descriptive statistics and plots of test information functions (TIFs), and the standard errors of the ability estimate (SEEs). The item pool performance is evaluated based on the descriptive statistics of measurement precision, test length and exposure properties, content blueprint fulfillment, and mean proportion of off-grade items for each test.The results show that there are some situations in which incorporating off-grade items would be beneficial. For example, a testing organization with a small item pool attempting to improve item pool performance for high- and low-performing examinees. The results also show that practical constraints of incorporating off-grade items, organized here from most impact to least impact in item pool characteristics and item pool performance, are: 1) incorporating off-grade items into small baseline pool or large baseline pool; 2) broadening the range of off-grade items from one grade level to two grade levels; 3) increasing the proportion of off-grade items in the item pool; and 4) applying variable- or fixed-length CAT. The results indicated that broadening the range of off-grade items yields improvements in measurement precision and content blueprint fulfillment when compared to increasing the proportion of off-grade items. This study could serve as guidance for test organizations when considering the benefits and limitations of incorporating off-grade items into on-grade item pools.

AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

AB  - Objective This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. Methods Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; aged 7<e2><80><93>17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. Results Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. Conclusions HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

TI  - Accuracy of the of the PROMIS-57 questionnaire to identify significant depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients on hemodialysis
JO  - Journal of Psychosomatic Research

PB  - Elsevier Science Ltd.
CY  - London
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone<c2><a9> crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

AB  - Background The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Methods All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. Results The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170 <c2><b1> 67 s (average <c2><b1> Stdev) to answer 25 <c2><b1> 6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R2 values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R2 values of 0.5236. Conclusions PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

AB  - Two-sample multiple testing has a wide range of applications. The conventional practice first reduces the original observations to a vector of p-values and then chooses a cutoff to adjust for multiplicity. However, this data reduction step could cause significant loss of information and thus lead to suboptimal testing procedures. In this thesis, I present a new framework for two-sample multiple testing by incorporating a carefully constructed auxiliary variable in inference to improve the power. A data-driven multiple testing procedure is developed by employing a covariate-assisted ranking and screening (CARS) approach that optimally combines the information from both the primary and auxiliary variables. The proposed CARS procedure is shown to be asymptotic valid and optimal for false discovery rate (FDR) control. The procedure is implemented in the R-package CARS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of CARS in FDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. CARS is also illustrated through an application to the analysis of satellite imaging data set for supernova detection. In addition to the aforementioned two-sample multiple testing problem, multistage designs have been used in a wide range of scientific fields as well. By allocating sensing resources adaptively, one can effectively eliminate null locations and localize signals with a smaller study budget. We formulate a decision-theoretic framework for simultaneous multistage adaptive testing and study how to minimize the total number of measurements while meeting pre-specified constraints on both the false positive rate (FPR) and missed discovery rate (MDR). The new procedure, which effectively pools information across individual tests using a simultaneous multistage adaptive ranking and thresholding (SMART) approach, can achieve precise error rates control and lead to great savings in total study costs. Numerical studies confirm the effectiveness of SMART for FPR and MDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. The SMART procedure is demonstrated through the analysis of high-throughput screening data and spatial imaging data. I also discuss ongoing and future research directions in this thesis, particularly on the topics of online FDR control and structured multiple testing. For applications, I discuss in detail on using online FDR control for real time anomaly detection for user engagement metrics at Snap Inc.

CY  - United States -- Minnesota
AB  - High-stakes licensure or certification examinations are required for many health professions disciplines to ensure safe entry-level practice. Accrediting agencies set a benchmark for graduates<e2><80><99> first-time licensure or certification success as a measure of program effectiveness. Failures of graduates on licensure or certification examinations may directly affect the school<e2><80><99>s recruitment and retention of qualified students and faculty, as well as institutional financial viability. A health science university has added Health Education System, Inc. (HESI) standardized examinations using computer adaptive testing into the family nurse practitioner (FNP) master<e2><80><99>s program to support certification success, although research on these advanced practice examinations as related to certification outcomes was lacking. Guided by classical test theory, this study was an investigation of whether a relationship existed between students<e2><80><99> performance on 4 HESI standardized examinations (Advanced Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacotherapeutics, Advanced Health Assessment, and the APRN/FNP Exit exam) and first-time FNP certification success. Binary logistic regression analysis of data from 117 students who graduated between 2013<e2><80><93>2016 indicated that none of the 4 standardized HESI examinations significantly predicted FNP certification success, perhaps due to the examinations not carrying any evaluative weight within the program. The results of this project study may be used to promote positive social change by providing a means to improve first-time certification success and increasing the availability of primary care providers in the role of FNP.

AB  - Context: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. Objective: This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. Methods: Patients (ages 7-22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. Results: Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms et<c2><a0>al., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial ([greater than or equal to] |.30|) correlations. The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested.

AB  - Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice (EBBP) is a transdisciplinary systematic approach that emphasizes the use of best evidence in combination with clinical expertise, as well as patient preferences and values, to make clinically-informed decisions about care and treatment (Spring, 2007). Despite numerous benefits and strong policy support of EBBP, findings indicate that clinicians generally fail to implement EBBP in standard clinical practice due to a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and low self-efficacy associated with an absence of resources. To address the need for EBBP resources and tools, Bonnie Spring, PhD and colleagues developed a theory-driven website for graduate students and clinicians. The website is primarily comprised of two components: nine interactive training modules and a novel assessment portal that utilizes patient-reported computer adaptive tests (CATs). To date, the training modules and assessment portal have not been evaluated, and there is currently a critical need to incorporate mixed methods evaluations into EBBP implementation science. The goal of this dissertation is to contribute to the ongoing evaluation and optimization of the EBBP Project by conducting summative and implementation-focused formative evaluations of its training modules and assessment portal. Aim 1 evaluated changes in user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy for each EBBP module and determined whether these outcomes varied by user characteristics, including degree, professional discipline, and number of completed modules. Together, findings suggested heightened interest and use of asynchronous, web-based training modules about EBBP in social work and psychology, and that these modules can produce short-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about EBBP. Overall, however, attrition continues to be a challenge. To better understand the attrition rates of the EBBP training modules and web-based modules, in general, Aim 2 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics related to module engagement. Overall, findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses (i.e., mixed method analyses) revealed that specific instructional guidance and interactive features, coupled with user technical knowledge, are particularly important characteristics that may improve engagement in asynchronous web-based training modules. Given the novelty of the EBBP assessment portal, Aim 3 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics associated with its engagement and implementation. Results from mixed method analyses suggested that user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy, coupled with programmatic functions to ensure privacy and confidentiality of patient information, may be important characteristics to improving engagement with a CATs-based assessment portal. In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information on the short-term effectiveness of asynchronous web-based modules, and factors that may contribute to engagement and implementation of online training and clinical tools for EBBP.

AB  - Aberrant responses, which are caused by examinees' unusual behaviors (e.g., carelessness, speededness, item pre-knowledge, warm-up, copying answers from neighbors), are frequently seen in various testing programs. Having aberrant responses may bias item parameter estimates and threaten test validity. Thus proper modeling and detection of aberrant responses is crucial both theoretically and practically in educational and psychological measurement. Previous work has primarily approached the aberrant responses research in terms of developing person fit statistics and proposing models to capture the aberrant behaviors. This dissertation attempts to incorporate change-point analysis (CPA) to investigate two types of aberrant responses: speededness and warm-up effect; both of which can be viewed as having an abrupt change point. This is an extension work of Shao, Li, and Cheng (in press) which first introduced the CPA method to detect test speededness with known item parameters. Following this line of research, three studies are carried out. The first study investigates whether CPA can help improve item calibration in the presence of speededness. In this study, the CPA method is used to first detect speeded responses with unknown item parameters. After the detection of speeded examinees as well as their corresponding speeding point (the point at which an examinee starts to speed), a cleansing procedure based upon the detected speeding point is proposed to help improve item parameter estimation. The performance of speededness detection as well as the item parameter recovery before/after utilizing the cleansing procedure are evaluated. The second study applies the CPA method to warm-up effect detection. This study first compares the impact of warm-up effect on ability estimation and examinees' classification accuracy on two types of tests: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Paper and Pencil (linear) Testing. In the second step, the CPA based detection of warm-up effect is carried out. Two methods of obtaining the critical values are utilized in the study. Different from the first two studies which both conduct CPA using item response information, the third study applies CPA to response time data in speededness detection. A gradual change log-normal model is proposed to better model the real-life change of response time affected by speededness. Two test statistics are introduced to test for a change point using response time. Moreover, this study explores the possibility of using a fixed critical value across conditions at each nominal level so that practitioners do not have to obtain a critical value through simulation every time they run speededness detection. The dissertation thesis concludes with the final chapter including a discussion of the results, limitations, practical implications, and future directions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes >.90). The P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may be a viable and efficient assessment method.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which item response theory (IRT) proficiency estimation methods are robust to the presence of aberrant responses under the "GRE"<c2><ae> General Test multistage adaptive testing (MST) design. To that end, a wide range of atypical response behaviors affecting as much as 10% of the test items were simulated using a generic GRE 2-stage MST and the 2-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model. As expected, some differences were found among the 5 estimators in terms of the recovery of the true theta ability; for example, Bayesian estimators had lower error variance and their estimates were regressed to the mean.Once the IRT theta estimates were scaled onto a comparable reporting score scale, however, it was found that all the estimation methods investigated, including the one currently used to score GRE MSTs, were equally robust under the simulated conditions.

TI  - Improving Binary Classifier Performance Through an Informed Sampling Approach and Imputation
JO  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
VL  - NA
PY  - 2016
PB  - Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal (Canada)
CY  - Canada -- Quebec, CA
AB  - In the last two decades or so, some of the substantial advances in machine learning relate to sampling techniques. For example, boosting uses weighted sampling to improve model training, and active learning uses unlabeled data gathered so far to decide what are the most relevant data points to ask an oracle to label. This thesis introduces a novel sampling technique that uses features entropy to guide the sampling, a process we call informed sampling. The central idea is that the reliability of model parameter learning may be more sensitive to variables that have low, or high entropy. Therefore, adapting the sampling rate of variables based on their entropy may lead to better parameter estimates. In a series of papers, we first test this hypothesis for three classifier models, Logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and over a binary classification task with a 0<e2><80><93>1 loss function. The results show that the high-entropy sampling (higher sampling rate for high entropy variables) systematically improves the prediction performance of the TAN classifier. However, for the NB and LR classifiers, the picture is more blurry. Improvements are obtained for only half of the 11 datasets used, and often the improvements come from high-entropy sampling, seldom from low-entropy sampling. This first experiment is replicated in a second study, this time using a more realistic context where the entropy of variables is unknown a priori, but instead is estimated with seed data and adjusted on the fly. Results showed that using a seed dataset of 1% of the total number of instances, which ranged from a few hundreds to around 1000, the improvements obtained from the former study hold for TAN with an average improvement of 13% in RMSE reduction. For the same seed size improvements were also obtained for the Naive Bayes classifier by a factor of 8% from low instead of high entropy sampling. Also, the pattern of improvements for LR was almost the same as obtained from the former study. Notwithstanding that classifier improvements can be obtained through informed sampling, but that the pattern of improvements varies across the informed sampling approach and the classifier model, we further investigate how the imputation methods affect this pattern. This question is of high importance because informed sampling necessarily implies missing values, and many classifiers either require the imputation of missing values, or can be improved by imputation. Therefore imputation and informative sampling are likely to be combined in practice. The obvious question is whether the gains obtained from each are additive or if they relate in a more complex manner. The gain from imputation methods are first studied in isolation with a comparative analysis of the performance of some new and some well known imputation algorithms, with the objective of determining to which extent the pattern of improvements is stable across classifiers for the binary classification and 0<e2><80><93>1 loss function. Here too, results show that patterns of improvement of imputation algorithms can vary substantially per model and also per missing value rate. We also investigate the improvements along a different dimension which is whether the rate of sampling per record is stable or varies. Minor, but statistically significant differences are observed in the results, showing that this dimension can also affect classifier performance. In a final paper, first the levels of improvement from informed sampling are compared with those from a number of imputation techniques. Next, we empirically investigate whether the gains obtained from sampling and imputation are additive, or they combine in a more complex manner. The results show that the individual gains from informed sampling and imputation are within the same range and that combining high-entropy informed sampling with imputation brings significant gains to the classifiers' performance, but generally, not as a simple sum of the individual improvements. It is also noteworthy that despite the encouraging results for some combinations of informed sampling and imputation algorithms, detailed analysis of individual dataset results reveals that these combinations rarely bring classification performance above the top imputation algorithms or informed sampling by themselves. The results of our studies provide evidence of the effectiveness of informed sampling to improve the binary classification performance of the TAN model. Also, high-entropy sampling is shown to be the most preferable scheme to be conducted. This for example, in the context of Computerized Adaptive Testing, can be translated to favoring the highly uncertain questions (items of average difficulty). Variable number of items administered is another factor that should be taken into account when imputation is involved.

L'id<c3><a9>e centrale est que la fiabilit<c3><a9> de l'estimation des param<c3><a8>tres d'un mod<c3><a8>le peut d<c3><a9>pendre de l'entropie des variables.

Toutefois, pour les classificateurs NB et LR, les r<c3><a9>sultats ne sont pas concluants. Des am<c3><a9>liorations sont obtenues pour seulement la moiti<c3><a9> des 11 ensembles de donn<c3><a9>es utilis<c3><a9>es et souvent les am<c3><a9>liorations proviennent de l'<c3><a9>chantillonnage <c3><a0> entropie <c3><a9>lev<c3><a9>e, rarement de l'<c3><a9>chantillonnage <c3><a0> entropie faible.Cette premi<c3><a8>re exp<c3><a9>rience est reproduite dans une deuxi<c3><a8>me <c3><a9>tude, cette fois en utilisant un contexte plus r<c3><a9>aliste o<c3><b9> l'entropie des variables est inconnue <c3><a0> priori, mais plut<c3><b4>t estim<c3><a9>e avec des donn<c3><a9>es initiales et o<c3><b9> l'<c3><a9>chantillonnage est ajust<c3><a9> <c3><a0> la vol<c3><a9>e avec les nouvelles estimation de l'entropie.Les r<c3><a9>sultats d<c3><a9>montrent qu'avec l'utilisation d'un ensemble de donn<c3><a9>es initial de 1% du nombre total des exemplaires, qui variait de quelques centaines <c3><a0> environ 1000, les gains obtenus de l'<c3><a9>tude pr<c3><a9>c<c3><a9>dente persistent pour le mod<c3><a8>le TAN avec une am<c3><a9>lioration moyenne de 13% dans la r<c3><a9>duction l'erreur quadratique.

Ici encore, les r<c3><a9>sultats montrent que les am<c3><a9>liorations obtenues par des techniques d'imputation peuvent varier consid<c3><a9>rablement par mod<c3><a8>le et aussi par taux de valeur manquante. Nous <c3><a9>tudions <c3><a9>galement les am<c3><a9>liorations le long d'une autre dimension qui est de savoir si le taux d'<c3><a9>chantillonnage par enregistrement est stable ou varie.

Les r<c3><a9>sultats montrent que les gains individuels de l'<c3><a9>chantillonnage inform<c3><a9> et d'imputation sont du m<c3><aa>me ordre de grandeur, mais en g<c3><a9>n<c3><a9>ral, ils ne sont pas une simple somme des am<c3><a9>liorations individuelles.

AB  - Animal carcinogenicity experiments are conducted by private entities and government agencies to investigate whether a substance causes cancer. Since most tumors are occult and it is necessary to conduct a necropsy to detect the presence of cancer, producing unbiased tests for differences in tumor incidence is challenging. The highest doses given in these experiments often have toxic effects in the animals or might affect tumor lethality, and many common statistical methods for survival data perform poorly when such effects induce differences in mortality across treatment groups. The poly- k test, developed by Bailer & Portier (1988) as a modification of the Cochran-Armitage test, was designed to avoid problems from differential mortality, but is based on strong parametric assumptions, specifically that underlying tumor hazard may be modeled as Weibull with shape parameter k (usually set to 3). Existing literature that examines the performance of the poly-k and competitor tests assumes Weibull tumor hazards, and finds that the poly-k can be biased under treatment toxicity when its shape parameter assumption is not met. Given that this test has become a standard for government agencies such as the National Toxicology Program and the FDA, closer examination is warranted. Our simulations examine the performance of the poly-k under non-Weibull tumor hazards, and find that our own parametric tests can outperform it under these conditions. For tests like the poly-k, our goal is to develop and examine the performance of adaptive testing algorithms that estimate a test's parameter based on the data; one such estimation was suggested under Weibull assumptions by Moon et al. (2003), though their approach based on estimating lifetime cumulative tumor incidence rates does not make full use of the available data, and requires that the experiment include multiple interim sacrifices for adequate performance. Under most of our simulation settings, our k<cb><86> MLE test, based on estimating the shape parameter k by maximizing the full likelihood, has type I error and power very similar to the poly-k test with correctly-specified k, and it maintains size better, with comparable or higher power, than the test based on the Moon et al. estimate. Our MLE-based test does not require interim sacrifices, although it may perform better under some interim sacrifice experimental designs. We compare these tests under a variety of parametric assumptions and serial sacrifice designs to examine which experimental settings are most optimal for test performance.

AB  - This thesis sought to address the application of non-parametric item response theory (NIRT) to cognitive and functional assessment in dementia. Performance on psychometric tests is key to diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. NIRT can be used to improve the psychometric properties of tests used in dementia assessment in multiple ways: confirming an underlying unidimensional structure, establishing formal item hierarchical patterns of decline, increasing insight by examining item parameters such as difficulty and discrimination, and creating shorter tests. From a NIRT approach item difficulty refers to the ease with which an item is endorsed. Discrimination is an index of how well an item can differentiate between patients of varying levels of severity. Firstly I carried out a systematic review to identify applications of both parametric and non-parametric IRT to measures assessing global cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This review demonstrated that IRT can increase the interpretive power of cognitive assessment scales and confirmed the limited number of IRT analyses of cognitive scales in dementia populations. This thesis extended this approach by applying Mokken scaling analysis to commonly used measures of current cognitive ability (Addenbrooke<e2><80><99>s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)) and of premorbid cognitive ability (National Adult Reading Test (NART)). Differential item functioning (DIF) by diagnosis identified slight variations in the patterns of hierarchical decline in the ACE-R. These disease-specific sequences of decline could serve as an adjunct to diagnosis, for example where learning a name and address is a more difficult task than being orientated in time, late onset Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease is a more probable diagnosis than mixed Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s and vascular dementia. These analyses also allowed key items to be identified which can be used to create briefer scales (mini-ACE and Mini-NART) which have good psychometric properties. These scales are clinically relevant, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items. They also allow sensitive measurement and adaptive testing and can reduce test administration time and patient stress. Impairment of functional abilities represents a crucial component of dementia diagnosis with performance on these functional tasks predictive of overall disease. A second aspect of this thesis, therefore, was the application of Mokken scaling analyses to measures of functional decline in dementia, specifically the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS). While gender DIF was observed for several items, implying the likelihood of equal responses from men and women is not equal a generally consistent pattern of impairment in functional ability was observed across different types of dementia.

AB  - It is known that the stiffness of many soils is higher at small strains than at the large strains used in typical triaxial testing. Understanding this initial high stiffness and the factors affecting it is key to accurate displacement predictions. The recent stress history (RSH) effect describes how the stiffness degradation curve at small strains is affected by the immediately preceding stress path. The effect is usually described in terms of stress path rotation angle between an approach path and the shear probe upon which stiffness degradation is measured. The principle aim of the work was to investigate the relationship between the RSH effect, approach path length, and time dependent effects in more detail. A combination of physical testing and simulations with the BRICK constitutive model were used to achieve this. This has shown that in multistage testing the residual RSH effect from the first test increased the stiffness exhibited in the second, thus masking the natural behaviour. In addition the stress path rotation from consolidation to testing caused a stiffness reduction in the first test. This effect, newly termed recent consolidation history (RCH), was found to be degraded by the first test and so did not impact on the second. When allowance was made for these effects trends seen in the literature were supported. Due to the complex stress paths used in the physical testing, a number of improvements were required to the strain rate dependent (SRD) BRICK model to allow accurate simulations to be run. These included implementation of a bisecting iteration within the strain calculations, and a coordinate decent routine to allow creep and creep rupture to be modelled. The model was then used to simulate the physical tests to allow more insight into the interplay between the effects identified in the physical testing, ultimately supporting the conclusions drawn.

AB  - We propose a novel group testing framework, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome screening experiments in addition to other applications such as interpretable rule learning for decision making. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an integer-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a unifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing models are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the notion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable test matrices, representing generalizations of classical disjunct and separable matrices. We describe combinatorial and probabilistic constructions for such matrices without considering any restriction on the thresholds of the SQGT model (i.e. SQGT with arbitrary thresholds). Then, we focus on the important special case in which the thresholds are equidistant, and construct SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable matrices for this model. While for most of the constructions described in this dissertation, it is assumed that the number of defectives is much smaller than total number of test subjects, we also consider the case in which there is no restriction on the number of defectives and they may be as large as the total number of subjects. For the constructed matrices, we describe a number of efficient decoding algorithms based on algebraic methods and message passing on graphical models. Finally, we introduce the novel probabilistic group testing framework of Poisson group testing, applicable to dynamic testing with diminishing relative rates of defectives. For this new model, we consider both nonadaptive and adaptive testing schemes and develop lower bounds and tight constructive upper bounds on the number of required tests.

AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(TM)) is an NIH Roadmap initiative devoted to developing better measurement tools for assessing constructs relevant to the clinical investigation and treatment of all diseases-constructs such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, sleep, physical functioning, and social participation. Following creation of item banks for these constructs, our priority has been to validate them, most often in short-term observational studies. We report here on a three-month prospective observational study with depressed outpatients in the early stages of a new treatment episode (with assessments at intake, one-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up). The protocol was designed to compare the psychometric properties of the PROMIS depression item bank (administered as a computerized adaptive test, CAT) with two legacy self-report instruments: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999). PROMIS depression demonstrated strong convergent validity with the CESD and the PHQ-9 (with correlations in a range from .72 to .84 across all time points), as well as responsiveness to change when characterizing symptom severity in a clinical outpatient sample. Identification of patients as 'recovered' varied across the measures, with the PHQ-9 being the most conservative. The use of calibrations based on models from item response theory (IRT) provides advantages for PROMIS depression both psychometrically (creating the possibility of adaptive testing, providing a broader effective range of measurement, and generating greater precision) and practically (these psychometric advantages can be achieved with fewer items-a median of 4 items administered by CAT-resulting in less patient burden).

AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), structured in Itens Banks, provides a new tool for evaluating results that apply to various chronic diseases through advanced statistical techniques (TRI) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The aim of this study was to culturally adapt the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of PROMIS to the Portuguese language. The process followed the recommendations of PROMIS through the advanced translation, reconciliation, back-translation, FACIT review, independent review, finalization, pre-test, and incorporation of the results from the pre-test. The translated version was pre-tested in ten patients, and items 3, 46, and 53 of the Bank of Anxiety and item 46 of the bank of Depression had to be changed. Changes affected equivalence of meaning, and the final version was consistent with the Brazilian population's linguistic and cultural skills. In conclusion, for the Brazilian population the translated version proved semantically and conceptually equivalent to the original. Adapted from the source document

AB  - Background: Plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS) is a common foot disorder; however, there is limited clinical evidence on which to base treatment. Repeated clinical observations indicating heel pain during heel rise and minisquat on the affected leg, involving activation of posterior calf muscles, formed the basis of this study. Objective: To compare deep massage therapy to posterior calf muscles and neural mobilization with a self-stretch exercise program (DMS) to a common treatment protocol of ultrasound therapy to the painful heel area with the same self-stretch exercises (USS). Methods: Patients with PHPS were assigned to a program of 8 treatments over a period of 4-6 weeks in a single-blind randomized clinical trial. Functional status (FS) at admission and discharge from therapy as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was the main outcome measure. Results: Sixty-nine patients were included in the trial (mean age 53, standard deviation (SD) 13, range 25-86, 57% women), 36 received DMS treatment and 33 with USS. The overall group-by-time interaction for the mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was found statistically significant (p = 0.034), with a change of (mean (confidence interval, CI)) 15 (9-21) and 6 (1-11) FS points for the DMS and USS groups, respectively. Conclusions: Data indicated that both treatment protocols resulted in an overall short-term improvement, however, DMS treatment was significantly more effective in treating PHPS than USS treatment.

AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

TI  - Designing <i>p</i>-Optimal Item Pools for Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing

AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context. The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24 p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature. Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

AB  - Nursing programs increasingly use exit exams to increase graduating nursing students' readiness for the nurse licensing examination. These exams prepare students for computer adaptive testing and identify areas where remediation is needed. This study examines an Associate Degree in Nursing program that has shown consistently low exit exam scores causing delays in student graduation, eligibility to sit for the licensing exam, and entry into the workforce. The study was crafted to investigate student perspectives of the barriers to student success on the Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) exit exam. It employed a quantitative one-shot survey design to evaluate factors related to performance on the HESI exit exam, including lack of study time, lack of knowledge despite passing nursing courses, lack of motivation to prepare for the exam, overwhelming stress, poor test-taking skills, and lack of confidence. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that students' self-perceptions of poor test-taking skills had a significant negative effect on HESI exit exam scores. These findings were used to design a project focused on teaching test-taking skills throughout the nursing program. The study and project collectively promote positive social change by providing a means to improve nursing program graduation rates, a tool of great importance in addressing the current shortage of nurses in the United States' workforce.

AB  - Fueled by rapid technological and methodological development, research in the area of genetic epidemiology has brought many successes as well as analytical challenges in identification of genetic risk factors for disease risk. Many have predicted that the detection of heritable disease susceptibility variants could eventually lead to stable models for prediction of disease risk. This dissertation is devoted to the statistical methodological consideration and development in genetic association studies, as well as the use of weighted genetic risk score in predictive modeling of disease risk. We begin the work by reviewing a brief background into genetic association studies, predictive modeling and relevant analytic challenges. In Chapter 2, we discuss the theoretical relationship between classical multiple linear regression (MLR) and two-stage residual-outcome regression analysis (2SR) in terms of confounding adjustment. We demonstrate that the 2SR would introduce bias and loss of power in the presence of confounding, and thus remind researchers to be cautious in applying the 2SR in genetic association studies. In Chapter 3, we propose an adaptive permutation procedure in testing the significance of susceptibility genetic variants. Results show that the adaptive test is statistically valid as well as computationally feasible in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recommendations are made for the implementation of adaptive permutation in real studies. In Chapter 4, we develop an explained-variance based genetic risk score (GRS) for predictive modeling of disease risk. Extensive simulation studies suggest that this new weighted GRS is a robust risk score approach that consistently outperforms simple count and odds ratio based GRS approaches. In Chapter 5, we further explore the performance of GRS approaches in the presence of interactions, including statistical interaction, dependence and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results emphasize the advantage of weighted GRS even in more complicated settings, motivating its application in predictive modeling. This work concludes with several practical guidelines in genetic association studies and predictive modeling, and discussions of future perspectives.

AB  - The major concerns of adaptive testing studies have concentrated on effectiveness and efficiency of the system built for the research experiments. It has been criticised that such general information has fallen short of providing qualitative descriptions regarding learning performance. Takahiro Sato of Japan proposed an analytical diagram called Student-Problem Chart (S-P Chart) in the 1970. The S-P Chart is able to establish a learning diagnostic table which comments student learning performance in a verbal form. The advancement of computer technology has made the S-P analytical process more applicable for school teachers. This study examined how online comments provided by the S-P diagnostic table could affect the students' learning attitude. One hundred sixth grade students were selected to be the subjects of the study. An online embedded test was given to the subjects and an S-P diagnostic table was drawn by the computer to display instant comments on each student's learning performance. A Questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews were performed after the experiment. Results indicated that students liked the online qualitative comments. This is because students were able to instantly understand why they performed well/poor in the test, which is much beyond the numerical scores can explain. The results also showed that the online S-P diagnostic table made students more circumspect on answering the test questions in order to reduce careless mistakes. Students would also be more likely to review what they missed on the test. However, the S-P comment table seemed to have no effect on improving their learning performance. An online iterative drilling platform was consequently built to incorporate with the S-P diagnostic process to assist poorly performed students. It may effectively work with the S-P diagnostic process to provide constructive remediation for the students who exhibited a poor performance on the S-P chart.

AB  - The influence of elevated fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of fearavoidance on recovery of functional status during rehabilitation for people with shoulder impairments. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted. Data were collected from 3,362 people with musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder receiving rehabilitation. At intake and discharge, upperextremity function was measured using the shoulder Computerized Adaptive Test. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale. Completion rate at discharge was 57% for function and 47% for pain intensity. A single-item screen was used to classify patients into groups with low versus elevated fear-avoidance beliefs at intake. A general linear model (GLM) was used to describe how change in function is affected by fear avoidance in 8 disease categories. This study also accounted for within-clinic correlation and controlled for other important predictors of functional change in functional status, including various demographic and healthrelated variables. The parameters of the GLM and their standard errors were estimated with the weighted generalized estimating equations method. Functional change was predicted by the interaction between fear and disease categories. On further examination of 8 disease categories using GLM adjusted for other confounders, improvement in function was greater for the low fear group than for the elevated fear group among people with muscle, tendon, and softtissue disorders ( delta =1.37, P <.01) and those with osteopathies, chondropathies, and acquired musculoskeletal deformities ( delta =5.52, P<.02). These differences were below the minimal detectable change. Information was not available on whether therapists used information on level of fear to implement treatment plans. The influence of fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status varies among specific shoulder impairments.

AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients ( N =100) and Internet consumer health panel members ( N =101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor & Francis Ltd.

CY  - United States -- Massachusetts
AB  - IRT, also referred as â€œmodern test theoryâ€, offers many advantages over CTT-based methods in test development. Specifically, an IRT information function has the capability to build a test that has the desired precision of measurement for any defined proficiency scale when a sufficient number of test items are available. This feature is extremely useful when the information is used for decision making, for instance, whether an examinee attain certain mastery level. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is one of the many examples using IRT information functions in test construction. The purposes of this study were as follows: (1) to examine the consequences of improving the test quality through the addition of more discriminating items with different item formats; (2) to examine the effect of having a test where its difficulty does not align with the ability level of the intended population; (3) to investigate the change in decision consistency and decision accuracy; and (4) to understand changes in expected information when test quality is either improved or degraded, using both empirical and simulated data. Main findings from the study were as follows: (1) increasing the discriminating power of any types of items generally increased the level of information; however, sometimes it could bring adverse effect to the extreme ends of the ability continuum; (2) it was important to have more items that were targeted at the population of interest, otherwise, no matter how good the quality of the items may be, they were of less value in test development when they were not targeted to the distribution of candidate ability or at the cutscores; (3) decision consistency (DC), Kappa statistic, and decision accuracy (DA) increased with better quality items; (4) DC and Kappa were negatively affected when difficulty of the test did not match with the ability of the intended population; however, the effect was less severe if the test was easier than needed; (5) tests with more better quality items lowered false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rate at the cutscores; (6) when test difficulty did not match with the ability of the target examinees, in general, both FP and FN rates increased; (7) polytomous items tended to yield more information than dichotomously scored items, regardless of the discriminating parameter and difficulty of the item; and (8) the more score categories an item had, the more information it could provide. Findings from this thesis should help testing agencies and practitioners to have better understanding of the item parameters on item and test information functions. This understanding is crucial for the improvement of the item bank quality and ultimately on how to build better tests that could provide more accurate proficiency classifications. However, at the same time, item writers should be conscientious about the fact that the item information function is merely a statistical tool for building a good test, other criteria should also be considered, for example, content balancing and content validity.

AB  - Both theoretical and practical considerations have led the revision of the Graduate Record Examinations<c2><ae> (GRE<c2><ae>) revised General Test, here called the rGRE, to adopt a multistage adaptive design that will be continuously or nearly continuously administered and that can provide immediate score reporting. These circumstances sharply constrain the available options for equating or linking together the thousands of unique test forms that will need to be administered each year. The only practical method is to pre-equate each form through item response theory (IRT) methods. Unfortunately, doing so means that item position and context effects are both vitally important and potentially difficult to control. This study examines item position effects in a GRE context and attempts to assess the extent to which they may affect the rGRE. It was found that position effects are in fact present in GRE data and that they can be particularly troublesome under multistage testing. Pretest strategies are able to mitigate effects to some degree, but complete control will require careful attention be paid to the time limits and associated test configuration details in the design of the rGRE.

AB  - The main purpose of manufacturing test has been and continues to be to separate good integrated circuits (ICs) from ones that do not meet the desired operational characteristics. An ideal testing procedure should pass all good chips and fail all those that do not deliver the required functionality. However, a defective chip may pass all the tests, which leads to reduction in product quality. Product quality is commonly measured using defect level, which is the ratio of defective chips in all the chips that pass all tests. Defect level is typically expressed in units of defective parts per million shipped (DPPM). A variety of test sets derived using different test metrics are usually applied to ensure an acceptable quality level. However, various experiments involving actual ICs have shown that a significant portion of the test patterns applied do not contribute to the improvement in product quality, which indicates the possibility of significantly reducing the cost of test without affecting product quality, or alternatively improving product quality without incurring additional test cost. In this dissertation, a diagnosis-assisted adaptive test (DAT) method for improving test quality is described, developed, and validated. DAT uses diagnosis to capture the failure characteristics on a per-design basis and improves test quality by changing the test set to match the current failure characteristics. DAT uses (i) a multiple defect diagnosis method, referred to as MD2X, which is flexible in handling various defect behaviors, and (ii) a failing behavior identification (FBI) method that captures defect behavior by identifying signal lines related to defect activation. MD2X is evaluated using logic simulation experiments. Results from over 5,700 simulated and 131 failing ICs show that MD 2X can effectively diagnose circuits that are affected by a large (>20) or small number of defects of various types. Specifically, when diagnosing circuits with more than 20 defects, MD2X identifies 74% of them. For circuits affected by two defects, the number changes to 87%. This level of diagnosis accuracy for ICs of this type exceeds all claims currently found in the literature. The efficacy of FBI is validated using circuit- and logic-level simulation experiments. The results show that FBI achieves an average accuracy of 94% in identifying signal lines that are relevant to defect activation, a 28% improvement over prior art. DAT is validated using circuit-level simulation experiments and experiments involving real IC fail data. Circuit-level simulation involving various types of defects shows that defect level can be reduced by 30% using DAT. In addition, a new cost-efficient framework for evaluating test quality using tester data from failing ICs, which we call FETQ, has also been developed. FETQ is used to evaluate the quality of tests based on DAT. Among the test sets of the same size, the test set generated using DAT detects the most failing chips, and it uniquely fails one defective chip that is not detected by any of the test sets that are generated based on stuck-at, bridge, and input-pattern fault models. The test quality of DAT test sets is also compared with the original one used in production. The result shows that DAT test sets detect more failing chips with the same number of test patterns, or alternatively, the same number of failing chips could be detected using significantly fewer tests.

AB  - Semiconductor technology scaling has long been a source of dramatic gains in our computing capabilities. However, as we test the physical limits of silicon feature size, serious reliability and computational efficiency challenges confront us. The supply voltage levels have practically stagnated, resulting in increasing power densities and operating temperatures. Given that most semiconductor wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Further, the rise in power density is also limiting the number of resources that can be kept active on chip simultaneously, motivating the need for energy-efficient computing. In this landscape of technological challenges, incremental architectural improvements to existing designs are likely insufficient, motivating a need to rethink the architectural fabric from the ground up. Towards this end, this thesis presents adaptive architecture and compiler solutions that can effectively tackle reliability, performance and energy-efficiency demands expected in future microprocessors. For the reliability challenge, we present StageNet, a highly reconfigurable multicore architecture that is designed as a network of pipeline stages, rather than isolated cores. The interconnection flexibility in StageNet allows it to adaptively route around defective pieces of a processor, and deliver graceful performance degradation in the face of failures. We further complement the fault isolation ability of StageNet with an adaptive testing framework that significantly reduces the overhead of in-field fault detection. As a second contribution, we build upon the interconnection flexibility of StageNet to develop a unified performance-reliability solution. This subsequent design, named CoreGenesis, relies on a set of microarchitectural innovations and compiler hints to merge processor cores for a higher single-thread performance. This enables customization of processing ability (narrow or wide-issue pipelines) to the dynamic workload requirements. In the final work of this thesis, we investigate the sources of computational inefficiency in general purpose processors, and propose a configurable compute engine, named BERET, for substantial energy savings. The insight here is to cut down on the redundant instruction fetch, decode and register file access energy by optimizing the execution of recurring instruction sequences.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that commonly manifests in the feet as pain, swelling and deformity. These symptoms often have extensive and severe mutlidimensional consequences for people's lives and can be evaluated using a class of subjective outcome measures known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs have been advocated by the Darzi report and are central to reforms in the NHS.Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a new and novel PROM, the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument (SAFE), using a clinimetric approach and featuring an adequately pre-tested nomothetic (fixed scale) and idiographic (patient-specific scale) assessment strategy. A mixed methods approach was employed to develop the SAFE, with the formulation and implementation of a four phase sequential exploratory fully mixed methods design (SEMMD) that featured equal priority between the qualitative and quantitative components.The four phase SEMMD enabled the strategic and effective combination of methods to produce a PROM that is firmly rooted in the views and experiences of people with feet affected by RA. The nomothetic scale of the SAFE has evidence for face, content and convergent validity (Spearman-Rank co-efficients: 0.62 - 0.80) and excellent one week test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.86 - 1.00 ). The idiographic scale has evidence for face and content validity.The SAFE is a tool for both clinical practice and clinical research. In order to realise the full potential of the SAFE, further research will be undertaken to refine, develop the PROM and integrate it into clinical practice. Initially, it will be necessary to demonstrate additional measurement properties for the nomothetic scale, including clinical interpretability and responsiveness and also necessary to demonstrate quantitative measurement properties for the idiographic scale. Long term, the SAFE will be redeveloped using item response theory and implemented as a computerised adaptive test.

AB  - Background Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. Design This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Methods Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. Results On average, patients took about 1.5 minutes (SD <2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal clinically important improvement. Limitations Because this study was a secondary analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future studies would benefit from more complete data. Conclusions The results indicate the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

AB  - Purpose. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for measuring health status in knee osteoarthritis. Method. Three hundred and fifty-one patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) answered 118 questions from a range of widely used questionnaires. Three dimensions relevant to knee OA were identified by expert opinion as 'pain, mental and emotional status'; 'self-care and household activities' and 'mobility and social activities'. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the relationship between the items and their dimensions. After CFA, these dimensions were subjected to Rasch analysis to calibrate the items onto an interval scale. A CAT was developed for each dimension, and the results checked against simulated applications from 10,000 simulees. Results. After CFA and Rasch analysis, 14, 22 and 23 items remained in the first, second and third dimensions, respectively. Items were mostly free of differential item functioning for age, gender and duration of disease. Reliability exceeded 0.87 for each dimension. The health status levels generated using item banks and those obtained from the simulated CAT application were highly correlated (i.e. >0.91 for each dimension). On average, 8, 10 and 10 items were used to estimate the health status levels using the CAT for the first, second and third dimensions respectively. Conclusions. Using a combination approach of CFA and Rasch analysis, this study has shown that it is possible to calibrate items onto a single metric in a way that can be used to provide the basis of a CAT application.

AB  - Test equating allows direct comparison of test scores from alternative forms measuring the same construct by employing equating procedures to put the test scores on the same metric. Three equating procedures are commonly used in the literature including the concurrent calibration method, the linking separate calibration methods (e.g. the moment methods and the characteristic curve methods), and FPC (Fixed Parameter Calibration) method. The first two types of methods for traditional IRT model have been well developed. FPC is being emphasized recently because of its utility for constructing item bank and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). However, there are few studies that examine the equating accuracy of the FPC method compared to that of the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method. The equating methods for the traditional IRT model are not appropriate for linking testlet-based tests because the local independence assumption of IRT model cannot be held for this type of tests. Some measurement models, such as testlet response model, bi-factor model, and Rasch testlet model, were advanced to calibrate the models for the testlet-based tests. Few equating methods, however, that take into consideration the additional local dependence among the examinees' responses to items within testlets have been developed for linking testelet-based tests. To address the need to better understand the FPC method and to develop new equating methods for linking testlet-based tests, the studies were to compare the effectiveness of the three types of equating methods under different linking situations and to develop equating methods for linking testlet-based tests. Besides the equating methods concerned, other factors, including sample size, ability distribution, and characteristics of common items and testlets that might affect equating results were also considered. Three simulation studies were carried out to accomplish the research purposes. The first study compared the equating accuracies of the FPC, the linking separate calibration, and the concurrent calibration method based on the IRT model to equate item parameters under different conditions. The results indicated that the FPC method using BILOG-MG performed as well as the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method for linking the equivalent groups. However, the FPC method produced larger equating errors than the other two methods did when the ability distributions of the base and target groups were substantially nonequivalent. Differences in difficulties between the common items set and the total test did not substantially affect the equating results with the three methods, with other conditions being held equal. As expected, both small sample size and less number of common items led to slight greater equating errors. The second study developed an item characteristic curve method and a testlet characteristic curve method for the testlet response model to transform the scale of item parameters. It then compared the effectiveness of the characteristic curve methods and the concurrent calibration methods under different conditions in linking item parameters from alternate test forms which were composed of dichotomously scored testlet-based items. The newly developed item characteristic curve method and the testlet characteristic curve method were shown to perform similarly as or even better than the Stocking-Lord test characteristic curve method and the concurrent calibration method did. Ignoring the local dependence in model calibration substantially increased equating errors. And larger testlet variances for the common testlets led to greater equating errors. The last study used the concurrent calibration method under the multidimensional Rasch testlet model to link the testlet-based tests in which the testlets were composed of dichotomous, polytomous, and mixed-format items. The results demonstrated that the concurrent calibration method under the Rasch testlet model worked well in recovering the underlying item parameters. Again, equating errors were substantially increased if the local dependences were ignored in model calibration. And smaller testlet variances for the common testlets led to more accurate equating results. The results of the studies contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of the different equating methods, particularly those for linking testlet-based tests. They also help clarify influences of the other factors, such as characteristics of the examinees, features of the common items and common testlets on equating results. Testing practitioners and researchers may draw useful recommendations from the findings about equating method selection. Nevertheless, generalizations of the findings from the simulated studies to practical testing programs should be cautious.

AB  - Bayesian graphical models are commonly used to build student models from data. A number of standard algorithms are available to train Bayesian models from student skills assessment data. These models can assess student knowledge and skills from a few observations. They are useful for Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), for example, where the test items can be administered in order to maximize the information they will provide. In practice, such data often contain missing values and, under some circumstances, missing values far outnumber observed values. However, when collecting data from test results, one can often choose which values will be present or missing by a consequent test design. We study how to optimize the choice of test items for collecting the data that will be used for training a Bayesian CAT model, such as to maximize the predictive performance of the model. We explore the use of a simple heuristic for test item choice based on the level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of an item is derived from its initial probability of success and, thus, from its difficulty. The results show that this choice does affect model performance and that the heuristic can lead to better performance. Although the study<e2><80><99>s results are more exploratory than conclusive, they suggest interesting research avenues.

AB  - This dissertation investigated the impact of item parameter drift (IPD) on examinee ability measures, in the analysis of data generated from a computerized adaptive test (CAT) collected in year 2003 by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in a Medical Technologist (MT) examination. For the 2003 ASCP MT exam, the item bank included 1,270 items. Items were selected from seven subscales: (a) blood banking, (b) chemistry, (c) hematology, (d) immunology, (e) laboratory operations, (f) microbiology, and (g) urinalysis. ASCP administered this CAT to 2,555 examinees. The data were analyzed using a new hierarchical linear model (HLM), called the Rasch longitudinal model (RLM), which models interaction between the item and time, in addition to parameters of examinee ability and item difficulty (easiness). The analysis demonstrated how IPD within the item bank for the ASCP MT exam affected examinee ability measures, and the extent to which IPD altered certification or pass-fail decisions. The RLM identified items that exhibited significant IPD for each subscale and provided the magnitude (and direction) of IPD within the 2003 ASCP MT exam data. No one subscale was more sensitive to IPD than any other. Further, by including significant time effects (IPD), the RLM provided a better fit to the data than the Rasch model as an HLM. The RLM not only determined items exhibiting IPD but also compensated for the existence of IPD within the calculation of examinee abilities by using the drifted item difficulty value versus the anchored one. Consequently, the RLM provided more accurate measures of examinee ability and item difficulty than the Rasch model as analyzed using the WINSTEPS program As a result, using the RLM yielded a more efficient IPD detection method, one that identified items with IPD but also corrected the estimation of examinee abilities for the existence of IPD.

AB  - Objective -- Current health literacy measures are too long, imprecise, or have questionable equivalence of English and Spanish versions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and pilot testing of a new bilingual computer-based health literacy assessment tool. Methods -- We analyzed literacy data from three large studies. Using a working definition of health literacy, we developed new prose, document and quantitative items in English and Spanish. Items were pilot tested on 97 English- and 134 Spanish-speaking participants to assess item difficulty. Results -- Items covered topics relevant to primary care patients and providers. English- and Spanish-speaking participants understood the tasks involved in answering each type of question. The English Talking Touchscreen was easy to use and the English and Spanish items provided good coverage of the difficulty continuum. Conclusion -- Qualitative and quantitative results provided useful information on computer acceptability and initial item difficulty. After the items have been administered on the Talking Touchscreen (la Pantalla Parlanchina) to 600 English-speaking (and 600 Spanish-speaking) primary care patients, we will develop a computer adaptive test. Practice implications -- This health literacy tool will enable clinicians and researchers to more precisely determine the level at which low health literacy adversely affects health and healthcare utilization.

AB  - In this guide, the authors outline the advantages of online eAssessment and examine the intellectual, technical, legal and cost issues that arise from its use. This guide outlines the major assessment types that are suitable for online assessment and makes a key distinction between formative and summative assessment. The focus is primarily on the latter since that is where the difficulties are most acute and robust systems most critical. A range of practical issues relating to the key stages in running a summative e-exam are explored and advice given on system requirements and on how to ensure that the exam runs smoothly when you 'go live'. This section includes consideration of the way that using eAssessment might affect the standard setting and results analysis process. The section on future trends in online assessment explores possibilities such as computer adaptive testing and the automated assessment of free text answers. Finally, there is a consideration of the implications of these trends for management. Adapted from the source document.

CY  - United States -- Florida
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which administers only items relevant to respondents<e2><80><99> ability, has the advantage of measuring persons<e2><80><99> ability precisely with considerably fewer items than traditional tests. CAT has been proposed for use in healthcare to reduce the respondents<e2><80><99>, administrators<e2><80><99> or researchers<e2><80><99> burden in clinics/clinical trials. However, there have been few studies in healthcare that have investigated the optimal characteristics of a CAT. The objective of my study was to investigate: (1) the psychometrics of an item bank measuring upper extremity (UE) disorders for CAT use, (2) how different testing procedures affect the ability estimates from CAT, and (3) whether CAT produce better ability estimates than a traditional static short assessment. The psychometrics of the item bank developed by combining items from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Upper Extremity Functional Index were examined by confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis across body part impairments (neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand). Repeated-measures MANOVA was used to investigate the standard error (SE) and bias of ability estimates from CAT with different testing procedures. Structural equation modeling was implemented to examine the correlations between ability estimates from the full test and different CAT structures and the full test with a short form. Further, paired-sample t test was performed to investigate the SE and bias of ability estimates from CAT and a static short form. In general, the item bank was found essentially unidimensional, the generalized partial credit model fit to the data better than partial credit model and there was no significant DIF. The ability estimates from CAT with expected a posteriori ability estimation method was found to be more precise and more comparable to those from full test than ability estimates derived from the maximum likelihood estimation. Further, CAT had better precision, comparability to full test and sensitivity to detect change than a static short form. The findings from this study suggest that UE CAT differ across estimations methods and are significantly better than a short form version.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the combination of item response theory and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for psychiatric measurement as a means of reducing the burden of research and clinical assessments. METHODS: Data were from 800 participants in outpatient treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder; they completed 616 items of the 626-item Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Scales (MASS) at 2 times. The first administration was used to design and evaluate a CAT version of the MASS by using post hoc simulation. The second confirmed the functioning of CAT in live testing. RESULTS: Tests of competing models based on item response theory supported the scale's bifactor structure, consisting of a primary dimension and 4 group factors (mood, panic-agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, and social phobia). Both simulated and live CAT showed a 95% average reduction (585 items) in items administered (24 and 30 items, respectively) compared with administration of the full MASS. The correlation between scores on the full MASS and the CAT version was .93. For the mood disorder subscale, differences in scores between two groups of depressed patients -- one with bipolar disorder and one without -- on the full scale and on the CAT showed effect sizes of .63 (p < .003) and 1.19 (p < .001) standard deviation units, respectively, indicating better discriminant validity for CAT. CONCLUSIONS: Instead of using small fixed-length tests, clinicians can create item banks with a large item pool, and a small set of the items most relevant for a given individual can be administered with no loss of information, yielding a dramatic reduction in administration time and patient and clinician burden.

AB  - In a series of articles in this issue, Allen proposes and tests a model of movement1; reports the validity and reliability of a self-report instrument, the Movement Ability Measure (MAM)2; and tests the responsiveness to change of the MAM on a small sample of patients.3 The multidimensional model of movement-which includes flexibility, strength, accuracy, speed, adaptability, and endurance-specifies the term "movement" at the human, not cellular or molecular, level for the Movement Continuum Theory.4 As noted in Allen's discussion and in the invited commentaries by Cott and Finch, Martin, and Sullivan, the proposed model of movement has limitations, and the assessment tool has not been tested sufficiently to indicate that it is superior to other instruments such as the Outpatient Physical Therapy Improvement in Movement Assessment Log (OPTIMAL)5 or the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) "item bank" and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) assessment platform (AMPAC-CAT).6 It is clear that we are in the initial rather than final stages of consensus about an instrument that measures outcomes affected by physical therapy intervention and that crosses medical diagnoses, systems, practice settings, acuity, and other variables.

TI  - Relationships between NWEA -MAP score information and teachers' efficacy beliefs for student performance on the North Dakota State Assessment

PY  - 2007
PB  - North Dakota State University
CY  - United States -- North Dakota
AB  - In the current environment of federally mandated high-stakes testing, teachers and schools are under great pressure to ensure that students demonstrate proficiency on state assessments. Without formative feedback that connects what a teacher did in the classroom with positive outcomes on the state assessment, a teacher may not feel that he or she can make a difference in how students fare on the state assessment. Teachers who experience low self-efficacy use less effective teaching techniques, and this affects student learning. Many schools are now using computer adaptive testing, such as the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA-MAP), to provide teachers with formative information to use for instructional improvement. When adjustments to instruction result in higher student achievement, it can provide the teacher with mastery experiences that increase the teacher's efficacy perceptions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teachers' efficacy beliefs for making a difference in their students' performances on the state assessment and teachers' uses of NWEA-MAP test results. Teachers were surveyed using four measures of teacher efficacy and collective teacher efficacy. Two measures that were created for this study demonstrated high reliability with the study sample and correlated well with the two existing scales. Data were also collected on the ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information and the number of different ways they used score information. The results indicated that the number of ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information made a significant difference in teachers' scores on the efficacy measures: Using score information in three or four different ways was associated with the highest scores on the efficacy scales. Also, using test score information to set goals with students and to individualize instruction predicted teachers' efficacy scores to a greater degree than did using scores to adjust curriculum and instruction. The current study, with its two new measures and its suggestions of relationships between variables, provides a starting point for new lines of research in sources of teacher efficacy beliefs.

CY  - United States -- Nebraska
AB  - This study examined the amount of time spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items. Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels. A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners<e2><80><99> manual.

AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

AB  - There is a dearth of research involving advanced second language (L2) learners in the USA [Brantmeier, C., 2001. Second language reading research on passage content & gender: challenges for the intermediate level curriculum, Foreign Language Annals 34, 325-333; Young, D.J., 2003. Workshop on overcoming anxiety in the foreign language classroom. Language Learning Series, Washington University in St. Louis]. At some universities in the USA many freshmen test directly into the advanced levels of Spanish language instruction where the goal is to prepare students for the reading of lengthy, authentic texts. With 71 advanced L2 learners of Spanish, the current research project attempts to determine the reliability of self-assessment, as determined by a questionnaire previously utilized for placement [Birckbichler, D., Corl, K., Deville, C., 1993. The dynamics of language program testing: implications for articulation & program revision. The Dynamics of Language Program Direction. Heinle & Heinle, Boston, MA; Deville, M., Deville, C., 1999. Computer-adaptive testing in second language contexts. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 19, 273-299], to predict reading performance via computer-based testing (CBT) & subsequent reading achievement. All incoming freshmen completed self-assessment questions about L2 reading abilities before completing an online placement exam (OPLE). In order to assess subsequent reading performance, all students who tested into Advanced Spanish Grammar & Composition participated in an investigation during regular class time during the 3rd week of class. Participants read a short story, completed three different comprehension assessment tasks & additional self-assessment items. Overall, results of the present study suggest that self-assessment of L2 reading ability, as measured before & after reading via a 5-point scale, is not an accurate predictor variable for placement or subsequent performance. Advanced learners did not accurately estimate their L2 reading abilities as measured via CBT & in-class performance. Findings do not offer conclusive evidence about the value of self-assessment as a predictor of performance on CBT or as an indicator of subsequent classroom performance, but the current investigation provides indications as to the direction in which research on self-assessment of L2 reading needs to move. A more contextualized, criterion-referenced self-assessment instrument may be more beneficial for the placement of advanced readers in the USA. These results both echo & contradict prior research, which calls attention to the need for more investigations concerning instrumentation of self-assessment as a factor to be used in placement decisions for advanced learners. 2 Tables, 5 Figures, 1 Appendix, 58 References.

AB  - There is a dearth of research involving advanced second language (L2) learners in the USA [Brantmeier, C., 2001. Second language reading research on passage content and gender: challenges for the intermediate level curriculum, Foreign Language Annals 34, 325-333; Young, D.J., 2003. Workshop on overcoming anxiety in the foreign language classroom. Language Learning Series, Washington University in St. Louis]. At some universities in the USA many freshmen test directly into the advanced levels of Spanish language instruction where the goal is to prepare students for the reading of lengthy, authentic texts. With 71 advanced L2 learners of Spanish, the current research project attempts to determine the reliability of self-assessment, as determined by a questionnaire previously utilized for placement [Birckbichler, D., Corl, K., Deville, C., 1993. The dynamics of language program testing: implications for articulation and program revision. The Dynamics of Language Program Direction. Heinle and Heinle, Boston, MA; Deville, M., Deville, C., 1999. Computer-adaptive testing in second language contexts. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 19, 273-299], to predict reading performance via computer-based testing (CBT) and subsequent reading achievement. All incoming freshmen completed self-assessment questions about L2 reading abilities before completing an online placement exam (OPLE). In order to assess subsequent reading performance, all students who tested into Advanced Spanish Grammar and Composition participated in an investigation during regular class time during the 3rd week of class. Participants read a short story, completed three different comprehension assessment tasks and additional self-assessment items. Overall, results of the present study suggest that self-assessment of L2 reading ability, as measured before and after reading via a 5-point scale, is not an accurate predictor variable for placement or subsequent performance. Advanced learners did not accurately estimate their L2 reading abilities as measured via CBT and in-class performance. Findings do not offer conclusive evidence about the value of self-assessment as a predictor of performance on CBT or as an indicator of subsequent classroom performance, but the current investigation provides indications as to the direction in which research on self-assessment of L2 reading needs to move. A more contextualized, criterion-referenced self-assessment instrument may be more beneficial for the placement of advanced readers in the USA. These results both echo and contradict prior research, which calls attention to the need for more investigations concerning instrumentation of self-assessment as a factor to be used in placement decisions for advanced learners.

AB  - Computer Adaptive Sequential Testing (CAST) is a test delivery model that combines features of the traditional conventional paper-and-pencil testing and item-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The basic structure of CAST is a panel composed of multiple testlets adaptively administered to examinees at different stages. Current applications of CAST reply on the item response theory (IRT) and assume a unidimensional IRT model for scoring. This study evaluated the robustness of CAST when tests were constructed, administered, and scored by a unidimensional IRT model but item responses were multidimensional. Various conditions of multidimensionality were simulated in item pools, as well as different levels of content misclassification through manipulation of the correspondence between content area and dimension of items. An automated test assembly (ATA) process constructed CAST panels from the item pools, each representing a unique combination of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Administration of the panels was simulated and multidimensional response data were scored by the unidimensional IRT model. The ability scores, routing decisions, and pass-fail decisions were evaluated against "true" ability scores and decisions to assess the impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Results showed that, when multidimensionality was mild as measured by the angle distance between item clusters, unidimensional ability estimates and routing decisions were not sensitive to the level of content misclassification in item pools. Only when multidimensionality was severe, panels without content misclassification yielded more accurate ability estimates and routing decisions. However, type I errors of pass-fail decisions (defined as passing unqualified examinees) were the smallest for panels without content misclassification, regardless of the severity of multidimensionality. The conclusion was that, although content classification, affecting dimensional structure during test assembly, might not be a serious concern for unidimensional ability estimation and routing decisions for CAST with multidimensional data, it played a significant role in the accuracy of pass-fail decisions.

AB  - In recent years, comparisons between computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and paper-and-pencil tests (P&Ps) have focused less on equivalency and more on the construct validity of shifting between the modalities. Examinee motivation is one area of concern, including test and computer anxiety. One type of motivation, flow, has a characteristic pattern of development similar to the pattern of item selection in CAT. Flow theory posits that positive reinforcement is gained through the sensation of achieving optimal performance. This study attempts to determine whether CAT facilitates flow in examinees, enabling them to perform better than on P&Ps. Covariates like test and computer anxiety, academic achievement, and certain personality traits are taken into account. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 94 middle-school CAT examinees to 65 middle-school P&P examinees on their responses to the Flow State Scale 2 (FSS-2), and regression modeling revealed a significant interaction between test modality and test anxiety on state flow, and significant effects for trait flow, typical study time, gender, and ethnicity when controlling for other covariates. Significant effects on specific flow dimensions were also found. The effect of flow on test performance was examined, but may have been limited by sample size. Reliability and dimensionality was confirmed for several instruments, some for the first time with an adolescent population: FSS-2, the Dispositional Flow Scale 2, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Test Anxiety Inventory-Short Form, and the Computer Attitude Scale. Interviews with students were also conducted to confirm the validity of measuring flow in testing situations. Implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - This thesis addresses three aspects of movement, performance and perception in music performance. First, the playing of an accent, a simple but much used and practiced element in drumming is studied, second, the perception of gradually changing tempo, and third, the perception and communication of specific emotional intentions through movements during music performance. Papers I and II investigated the execution and interpretation of an accent in drumming, performed under different playing conditions. Players' movements, striking velocities and timing patterns were studied for different tempi, dynamic levels and striking surfaces. It was found that the players used differing movement strategies and that interpreted the accent differently, reflected in their movement trajectories. Strokes at higher dynamic levels were played from a greater average height and with higher striking velocities. All players initiated the accented strokes from a greater height, and delivered the accent with increased striking velocity compared to the unaccented strokes. The interval beginning with the accented stroke was also prolonged, generally by delaying the following stroke. Recurrent cyclic patterns were found in the players' timing performances. In a listening test, listeners perceived grouping of the strokes according to the cyclic patterns. Paper III concerned the perception of gradual tempo changes in auditory sequences. Using an adaptive test procedure subjects judged stimuli consisting of click sequences with either increasing or decreasing tempo, respectively. Each experiment included three test sessions at different nominal tempi (80, 120, and 180 beats per minute). The results showed that ten of the eleven subjects showed an inherent bias in their perception of tempo drift. The direction and magnitude of the bias was consistent between test sessions but varied between individuals. The just noticeable differences for tempo drift agreed well with the estimated tempo drifts in production data, but were much smaller than earlier reported thresholds for tempo drift. Paper IV studied how emotional intent in music performances is conveyed to observers through the movements of the musicians. Three players of marimba, bassoon, and saxophone respectively, were filmed when playing with the expressive intentions Happiness, Sadness, Anger and Fear. Observers rated the emotional content and movement cues in the videos clips shown without sound. The results showed that the observers were able to identify the intentions Sadness, Anger, and Happiness, but not Fear. The rated movement cues showed that an Angry performance was characterized by jerky movements, Happy performances by large, and somewhat fast and jerky movements, and Sad performances by slow, and smooth movements.

AB  - The McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ - SF) is a measure of pain published in 1987. This dissertation conducts a confirmatory factor analysis of the measure's structure, as well as a calibration of the items on the measure, using Item Response Theory. A total of 1185 patients reporting to two chronic pain care treatment centers completed the MPQ - SF in the course of their admission to treatment. Factor analyses of their data suggests a three-factor solution of â€œacute,â€ â€œemotional,â€ and â€œsorenessâ€ factors led to a higher order factor of â€œpain.â€ This solution provides an adequate fit for the data. Previously published one and two factor structures did not demonstrate adequate fit in this data set. Unidimensionality in this sample was supported by the presence of a higher order factor of â€œPain.â€ Items on the measure are calibrated using the two-parameter logistic model. Specifically, item slope and location parameters are calculated for each of the items, and differential item functioning is investigated between four subgroups of data. Performance on the items was contrasted between subgroups differing on gender, pain diagnosis, workers' compensation status and pain coping status using Raju's DFIT methodology. No differential test functioning was found; however, some individual items did display differential item functioning by subgroup. Sample characteristics that contribute to differential item functioning are examined further. Additionally, implications for diagnostic considerations and computer adaptive testing are discussed.

AB  - Computer-based testing is becoming popular with credentialing agencies because new test designs are possible and the evidence is clear that these new designs can increase the reliability and validity of candidate scores and pass/fail decisions. Research on MST to date suggests that the measurement quality of MST results is comparable to full-fledged computer-adaptive tests and improved over computerized fixed-form tests. MST's promise dwells in this potential for improved measurement with greater control than other adaptive approaches for constructing test forms. Recommending use of the MST design and advising how best to set up the design, however, are two different things. The purpose of the current simulation study was to advance an established line of research on MST methodology by enhancing understanding of how several important design variables affect outcomes for high-stakes credentialing. Modeling of the item bank, the candidate population, and the statistical characteristics of test items reflect an operational credentialing exam's conditions. Studied variables were module arrangement (4 designs), amount of overall test information (4 levels), distribution of information over stages (2 variations), strategies for between-stage routing (4 levels), and pass rates (3 levels), for 384 conditions total. Results showed that high levels of decision accuracy (DA) and decision consistency (DC) were consistently observed, even when test information was reduced by as much as 25%. No differences due to the choice of module arrangement were found. With high overall test information, results were optimal when test information was divided equally among stages; with reduced test information gathering more test information at Stage 1 provided the best results. Generalizing simulation study findings is always problematic. In practice, psychometric models never completely explain candidate performance, and with MST, there is always the potential psychological impact on candidates if test difficulty shifts are noticed. At the same time, two findings seem to stand out in this research: (1)<c2><a0>with limited amounts of overall test information, it may be best to capitalize on available information with accurate branching decisions early, and (2)<c2><a0>there may be little statistical advantage in exceeding test information much above 10 as gains in reliability and validity appear minimal.

AB  - In this study, we investigated how manipulations of voice similarity affect talker discrimination judgments in children. More specifically, we addressed the question of how different must two sentences be in terms of their average fundamental & formant frequencies for children to categorize these utterances as spoken by different talkers? Same-different judgments were obtained using an adaptive testing procedure in which the similarity of voice pairs was systematically varied. Participants included 5-year-old normal-hearing children & cochlear implant (CI) users ages 5-12 years, implanted at or before age 6 years with 2+ years of implant experience. Stimuli consisted of natural sentence-length utterances resynthesized to form a stimulus continuum of similar-sounding voices. The probability of "different talker" judgments was examined for each listener group as a function of pitch difference size. We compared this measure of "acceptable within-talker variability" under two different presentation conditions, one in which the linguistic content of the sentence was held constant & one in which the linguistic content was varied. We found that the spectral envelopes of two utterances, together with their average fundamental frequencies, needed to differ by at least 11-16% for normal-hearing children to perceive the voices as belonging to different talkers. Normal-hearing children maintained the perception of voice individuality over a larger frequency shift than previously studied normal-hearing adults. Although several individual children with implants exhibited response patterns that resembled those of normal-hearing children, most of the hearing-impaired children experienced difficulty perceiving even large differences between talkers. Both groups of children displayed essentially the same pattern of responses in both the "fixed sentence" & "varied sentence" conditions, indicating no effect of linguistic variability on the children's criteria for identifying two talkers as the same or different. Greater variability in performance was observed, however, in the varied sentence condition for both listener groups. Finally, within the CI group, higher spoken word recognition scores were found to be associated with better talker discrimination performance. Our results suggest that poor discrimination of pitch & timbre-based differences is a factor contributing to implanted children's difficulty with talker discrimination tasks; implications of this finding are discussed in detail. 4 Tables, 12 Figures, 4 Appendixes, 110 References.

AB  - Differential item functioning (DIF) is an important issue in large scale standardized testing. DIF refers to the unexpected difference in item performances among groups of equally proficient examinees, usually classified by ethnicity or gender. Its presence could seriously affect the validity of inferences drawn from a test. Various statistical methods have been proposed to detect and estimate DIF. This dissertation addresses DIF analysis in the context of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whose item selection algorithm adapts to the ability level of each individual examinee. In a CAT, a DIF item may be more consequential and more detrimental be cause fewer items are administered in a CAT than in a traditional paper-and-pencil test and because the remaining sequence of items presented to examinees depends in part on their responses to the DIF item. Consequently, an efficient, stable and flexible method to detect and estimate CAT DIF becomes necessary and increasingly important. We propose simultaneous implementations of online calibration and DIF testing. The idea is to perform online calibration of an item of interest separately in the focal and reference groups. Under any specific parametric IRT model, we can use the (online) estimated latent traits as covariates and fit a nonlinear regression model to each of the two groups. Because of the use of the estimated, not the true &thetas;, the regression fit has to adjust for the covariate â€œmeasurement errorsâ€. It turns out that this situation fits nicely into the framework of nonlinear error-in-variable modelling, which has been extensively studied in statistical literature. We develop two bias-correction methods using asymptotic expansion and conditional score theory. After correcting the bias caused by measurement error, one can perform a significance test to detect DIF with the parameter estimates for different groups. This dissertation also discusses some general techniques to handle measurement error modelling with different IRT models, including the three-parameter normal ogive model and polytomous response models. Several methods of estimating DIF are studied as well. Large sample properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies show that the resulting methods perform well in terms of Type-I error rate control, accuracy in estimating DIF and power against both unidirectional and crossing DIF.

AB  - This study describes the effects of manipulating item difficulty in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment. There are many potential benefits when using CATS as compared to traditional tests. These include increased security, shorter tests, and more precise measurement. According to IRT, the theory underlying CAT, as the computer continually recalculates ability, items that match that current estimate of ability are administered. Such items provide maximum information about examinees during the test. Herein, however, lies a potential problem. These optimal CAT items result in an examinee having only a 50% chance of a correct response. Some examinees may consider such items unduly challenging. Further, when test anxiety is a factor, it is possible that test scores may be negatively affected. This research was undertaken to determine the effects of administering easier CAT items on ability estimation and test length using computer simulations. Also considered was the administration of different numbers of initial items prior to the start of the adaptive portion of the test, using three different levels of measurement precision. Results indicate that regardless of the number of initial items administered, the level of precision employed, or the modifications made to item difficulty, the approximation of estimated ability to true ability is good in all cases. Additionally, the standard deviations of the ability estimates closely approximate the theoretical levels of precision used as stopping rules for the simulated CATs. Since optimal CAT items are not used, each item administered provides less information about examinees than optimal CAT items. This results in longer tests. Fortunately, using easier items that provide up to a 66.4% chance of a correct response results in tests that only modestly increase in length, across levels of precision. For larger standard errors, even easier items (up to a 73.5% chance of a correct response) result in only negligible to modest increases in test length. Examinees who find optimal CAT items difficult or examinees with test anxiety may find CATs that implement easier items enhance the already existing benefits of CAT.

AB  - Self-adapted testing has been described as a variation of computerized adaptive testing that reduces test anxiety and thereby enhances test performance. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of these proposed effects of self-adapted tests (SATs); meta-analysis procedures were used to estimate differences between SATs and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in proficiency estimates and post-test anxiety levels across studies in which these two types of tests have been compared. After controlling for measurement error, the results showed that SATs yielded proficiency estimates that were 0.12 standard deviation units higher and post-test anxiety levels that were 0.19 standard deviation units lower than those yielded by CATs. We speculate about possible reasons for these differences and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using SATs in operational settings. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - To satisfy the security requirements of computerized adaptive tests (CATs), efforts have been made to control the exposure rates of optimal items directly by incorporating statistical methods into the item selection procedure. Since differences are likely to occur between the exposure control parameter derivation stage and the operational CAT administrations, the exposure control methods may not fully accomplish the goal of controlling item exposure. This study explored the effects of the distribution changes on the performance of the Sympson and Hetter (SH) (J. Sympson and R. Hetter, 1985) and the Davey and Parshall (DP) (T. Davey and C. Parshall, 1995) procedures and provided an examination of the assertion that the Stocking and Lewis (M. Stocking and C. Lewis, 1998) conditional multinomial (SLC) procedure would function independently of an real examinee population. Simulations were carried out for this study using various combinations of the intended and real ability distributions. The results show that the changes in the examinees' ability distribution affected both SH and DP procedures in their control of the observed maximum exposure rates, and the effects were more profound for the SH method. The performance of the SLC method was demonstrated to be independent of the examinee's ability distributions in the operational CAT administrations. Contains 19 references, 5 tables, and 4 figures.

AB  - Computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) is quickly becoming the test mode of choice among many high-stakes testing agencies. Although some researchers suggest that CAT is comparable, if not better, than traditional paper-and-pencil testing, others have suggested that individual differences among examinees have not been fully explored. In particular, the additional cognitive demands imposed by CAT are not well understood. For example, in the CAT mode there is the added demand of moving back and forth from computer screen to scrap paper when one has to solve more complex problems. In traditional paper and-pencil (P&P) testing environments, there is but one mode with which to contend: paper-and-pencil. In addition, CAT may generate greater anxiety<e2><80><94>which further increases cognitive load<e2><80><94>among some test-takers than would be found with more traditional testing modes. For example, with CAT you cannot go back to review previous items or change previous answers. And CAT requires something that is anxiety provoking in and of itself for some individuals: use of a computer. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects, particularly the cognitive effects, of different testing environments on individual test-taker experience. Forty undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions: CAT mode or P&P testing mode. All subjects took the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination. Methodology for the study included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil instruments, videotaped recording of subject behavior, observation, and interview. Verbal protocol analysis of subsamples of subjects' work-toward-solution behavior on two analytical reasoning problems was also included. Results of multivariate and univariate analyses suggest significant differences across test mode, with respect to cognitive demands. Compared to subjects in the paper-and-pencil test mode, CAT subjects had significantly longer response times on analytical reasoning (AR) problems, relied more on scrap paper to model AR problems diagrammatically, and employed different problem-solving strategies. Differences in affective responses<e2><80><94>including anxiety and frustration<e2><80><94>further suggest test mode effects were present. CAT subjects expressed significantly more frustration with the test mode than did their P&P counterparts. Furthermore, CAT subjects with low computer confidence experienced significantly higher levels of test anxiety than did their more computer-confident peers. Implications for test developers and recommendations for further research are offered.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained increased popularity during the last decades. Consequently, admissions tests such as the GRE, the TOEFL, as well as other certification and licensure exams have been transformed from their paper-and-pencil versions to computerized adaptive versions. However, a major difference between the two test formats, from an examinee's point of view, is that examinees are usually not allowed to revise their answers on CATs. Some researchers feel that the validity of a CAT can increase with item review, since it allows them to rethink their answers and make corrections to items that have been misread or miskeyed. Other researchers believe that item review can decrease the efficiency and validity of a CAT since item review allows examinees to cheat on the test. The purpose of this study was to test the efficiency of a <e2><80><98> rearrangement procedure<e2><80><99> that rearranges and skips certain items in order to better estimate the examinees' abilities. This was examined through a simulation study. This rearrangement procedure permits examinees to change their answers on a CAT without allowing them to artificially inflate their test scores. If this procedure were adopted, it could help reduce the stress of examinees who feel that they have more control over the testing situation when they can revise their answers. This procedure could also help improve the reliability and validity of the CAT since errors due to misread and miskeyed answers would be corrected. The results of this simulation study have shown that when the Maximum Likelihood estimation was used, the rearrangement procedure was effective in reducing the bias of the ability estimates. With the Bayesian estimation, the rearrangement procedure increased the reliability, and slightly decreased the standard error of the estimates. However, the Bayesian method was not effective in reducing the bias of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure. There were not many differences in the accuracy of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure, when three or five items were reviewed. There were also very small differences in the effects that the item pool size had on the accuracy of the ability estimates after the rearrangement procedure.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly using novel tools (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in designing selection systems. While there is great interest in using these tools, there is little research to indicate how applicants react to them. As applicant reactions have been shown to affect a number of variables important to organizations (e.g., test fairness, job acceptance, productivity, recommendation intentions), it is important to understand what determines these reactions. A framework was developed to highlight a number of antecedents to, types of, and consequences of reactions to novel testing. The current study has a 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil - computerized) x 2 (perceived technical level of the job: high technical job - low technical job) x 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design. While test-takers' post-test perceptions do not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, factors such as computer anxiety and experience were shown to be important factors in determining success in the selection process. Results show the significant relationships between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing novel selection tools in an applicant setting.

AB  - This study represented a first attempt to evaluate the impact of local item dependence (LID) for Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The most basic CAT design and a simplified design for simulating CAT item pools with varying degrees of LID were applied. A data generation method that allows the LID among items to be defined was applied to generate five CAT item pools. The LID exhibited by these pools ranged from zero LID (complete local item independence) to extreme LID. Results indicate that for certain types of scoring an extreme amount of LID may adversely impact the final score obtained by the examinee. The estimated precision of the test was also affected by the extreme LID level studied here. For the medium level of LID, structured to display the amount of LID typically displayed by the Law School Admission Test, the effects of the LID were not troublesome.

AB  - This dissertation focused on the generation and evaluation of web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Memory and spatial visualization theory were explored in relation to the addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component. Analysis of the data determined that there was a significant difference between scores on the MRT Computer and MRT Memory test. The addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component did significantly affect results at the .05 alpha level. Reliability and discrimination estimates were higher on the MRT Memory version. The computerization of the paper and pencil version on the MRT did not significantly effect scores but did effect the time required to complete the test. The population utilized in the quasi-experiment consisted of 107 university students from eight institutions in engineering graphics related courses. The subjects completed two researcher developed, Web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the original paper and pencil version of the Mental Rotation Test. One version of the test included a visuo-spatial working memory loading. Significant contributions of this study included developing and evaluating computerized versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Previous versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test did not take advantage of the ability of the computer to incorporate an interaction factor, such as a visuo-spatial working memory loading, into the test. The addition of an interaction factor results in a more discriminate test which will lend itself well to computerized adaptive testing practices. Educators in engineering graphics related disciplines should strongly consider the use of spatial visualization tests to aid in establishing the effects of modern computer systems on fundamental design/drafting skills. Regular testing of spatial visualization skills will result assist in the creation of a more relevant curriculum. Computerized tests which are valid and reliable will assist in making this task feasible.

AB  - This study developed a model to simulate nonmodel-fitting responses in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment, and to examine the effectiveness of the model. The underlying idea was to simulate examinees' test behaviors realistically. This study simulated a situation in which examinees are exposed to or are coached on test items before actual testing. The multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) (M. Reckase, 1985) model was adopted for this study. Test characteristic curves and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were investigated. The results indicate that the probability of an examinee responding to an item correctly and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were influenced by the severity and the number of affected items. The results also suggest that the proposed model might be an effective tool for investigating the issue of nonmodel-fitting responses in a CAT environment. (Contains 7 figures and 39 references.)

AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an item response theory (IRT). Additionally this study examined the effect of repeated practice with ACCUPLACER on subsequent ACCUPLACER and COMPASS scores. General opinions of students toward ACCUPLACER and COMPASS and correlations between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and paper-and-pencil (P&P) formats were investigated. Methods. The investigator sampled 517 ACCUPLACER tests in order to develop a large number of response patterns and scores. This data source was used to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers and consistency between item response patterns and test scores in ACCUPLACER. This study employed seven classes of developmental mathematics; specifically, three classes were the experimental group and four classes comprised the control group. As treatment, students from the experimental group practiced the ACCUPLACER four times during the quarter. Students from all seven classes took the preACCUPLACER, postACCUPLACER, preCOMPANION, postCOMPANION, postCOMPASS, and Developmental Final Examinations. All students responded to the Opinionnaires of the ACCUPLACER and COMPASS. Scores on SAT-Math, SAT-Verbal, and Collegiate Placement Examination were obtained from students' records. Results. Test questions generated from all correct responses and test questions generated from all incorrect responses were disjoint. Starter questions were found to be moderately easy rather than average difficulty. Six of the twelve items were identical and appeared in the same position on many initially correct response patterns. Lower scores came from initially incorrect response patterns. Scores varied greatly within the same response pattern when different sequences of items were given. A total of 108 different items were found, not the expected 214 items. Several starter questions appeared as later items in tests with primarily incorrect responses. Some correlations between CAT and P&P formats were significant $(p < .05).$ Students found that instructions and graphics were unclear on CATs. Conclusions. The results of this study are not consistent with five of the purported claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an IRT framework. Several sets of scores within the same response pattern widely varied. Repeated practice on a CAT did not affect subsequent CAT scores. Correlations between CAT and P&P formats indicate that one format of testing is not a good predictor of the other form of testing. Remedial students find CATs difficult to understand.

CY  - United States -- Iowa
AB  - This study investigated and compared the properties of five methods of item exposure control within the purview of estimating examinees' abilities in a CAT context. Simulations were used to carry out this research. The item pools were constructed based on item parameters calibrated from the existing paper-and-pencil ACT Assessment Mathematics Test. Each of the exposure control algorithms was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed according to the CAT design established for this study. The merits and shortcomings of these strategies were considered under two item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of item security, test overlap rates, pool utilization, and the conditional standard errors of measurement, bias, and root mean squared errors. The general observations revealed that the randomization technique did not better ensure item security to any noticeable extent than the procedure without exposure control. The Sympson and Hetter and the Stocking and Lewis unconditional multinomial procedures produced very similar results under all conditions. However, when developing the exposure control parameters, the Sympson and Hetter method was much more efficient. The results yielded by the Davey and Parshall procedure were in general favorable. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates, but this came at the price of decreases in precision due to the strict control of item exposure. The performance of the various methods was affected differentially by the size of the item pool. Also, the comparative properties of the various methods were not consistent under the two desired exposure rate conditions. These differential effects might be attributed to the specific features of the algorithms in combination with the structure of the item pool. Each method had its advantages and disadvantages, but none possessed all desired characteristics. There was a clear and logical trade-off between exposure control and measurement precision. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure, and to a slightly lesser extent, the Davey and Parshall method seemed to be the most promising considering all factors this study addressed.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

TI  - An investigation of selected variables to predict student performance on the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) in one baccalaureate degree nursing program

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well academic, demographic, and programmatic variables could explain and predict variation in graduate performance on NCLEX-RN in one baccalaureate nursing program. The study specifically sought to address the void in empirical research in the area of programmatic variables predictive of NCLEX-RN performance. The study also investigated whether the changes made in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to computer adaptive testing (CAT), which was initiated in 1994, could help explain variations experience in program pass rate between 1990 and 1996. The population was composed of 360 May and June graduates from one baccalaureate nursing program. The research method used in this study was an archival survey. Analysis of t-tests and z-tests showed that the two outcome groups (pass group and fail group) differed significantly (p $<$.05) in terms of gender and ethnicity. Moreover, the two groups differed significantly in terms of many academic variables (ACT Composite score; admission, freshman, sophomore, junior, cumulative, nursing and science GPA's; and number of nursing and support courses repeated). In the final logistic regression model, four of the independent variables; gender (SEX), nursing GPA, number of nursing and support courses repeated (REPEAT), and the mean educational level of the clinical nursing faculty (C-ED), were found to be significant predictors of NCLEX-RN performance (p $<$.05; one-tailed probability). The author concluded that male and minority students, and student who have repeated nursing and support courses, are at risk for failure on NCLEX-RN. Additionally, because the education of the clinical faculty proved to affect graduate odds for success on NCLEX-RN, it was recommended that programs strive to attract, recruit, and retain highly qualified clinical faculty. When added to the regression equation, the version of the NCLEX-RN did not prove to be statistically significant. The researcher concluded, therefore, that the change in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to CAT did not contribute to the variations in the NCLEX-RN pass rate experienced by this nursing program.

TI  - Accuracy of parameter estimation on polytomous IRT models

PY  - 1997
PB  - University of Massachusetts Amherst
CY  - United States -- Massachusetts
AB  - Procedures based on item response theory (IRT) are widely accepted for solving various measurement problems which cannot be solved using classical test theory (CTT) procedures. The desirable features of dichotomous IRT models over CTT are well known and have been documented by Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991). However, dichotomous IRT models are inappropriate for situations where items need to be scored in more than two categories. For example, in performance assessments, most of the scoring rubrics for performance assessment require scoring of examinee's responses in ordered categories. In addition, polytomous IRT models are useful for assessing an examinee's partial knowledge or levels of mastery. However, the successful application of polytomous IRT models to practical situations depends on the availability of reasonable and well-behaved estimates of the parameters of the models. Therefore, in this study, the behavior of estimators of parameters in polytomous IRT models were examined. In the first study, factors that affected the accuracy, variance, and bias of the marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimators in the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) were investigated. Overall, the results of the study showed that the MML estimators of the parameters of the GPCM, as obtained through the computer program, PARSCALE, performed well under various conditions. However, there was considerable bias in the estimates of the category parameters under all conditions investigated. The average bias did not decrease when sample size and test length increased. The bias contributed to large RMSE in the estimation of category parameters. Further studies need to be conducted to study the effect of bias in the estimates of parameters on the estimation of ability, the development of item banks, and on adaptive testing based on polytomous IRT models. In the second study, the effectiveness of Bayesian procedures for estimating parameters in the GPCM was examined. The results showed that Bayes procedures provided more accurate estimates of parameters with small data sets. Priors on the slope parameters, while having only a modest effect on the accuracy of estimation of slope parameters, had a very positive effect on the accuracy of estimation of the step difficulty parameters.

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT.

AB  - In the past several years many statistical indices have been developed that attempt to quantify the extent to which responses to questions on a test fit the underlying test model. This area of research is commonly referred to as person fit. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a test administration procedure in which questions are selected from a pool of available questions depending on how an examinee has responded to previous test questions. Thus, within the CAT environment each examinee is administered a tailored or dynamic test that is unique compared to other examinees' tests. Previous researchers have not investigated the issue of person fit within the context of CAT. The present study was a monte carlo investigation that simulated nonmodel-fitting responses within the CAT environment under a variety of conditions. The independent variables in this investigation were (1) the number of nonmodel-fitting responses, (2) the location of the nonmodel-fitting responses, (3) the point in the CAT process at which testing terminated, and (4) the entry point used for the CAT. The dependent variables were (1) the number of questions administered, (2) accuracy of the estimates of examinees' location on the latent trait ability continuum ($\theta$), (3) each examinee's fit to the underlying model using the $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices, and (4) the distribution of $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices within the CAT environment. It was found that when several nonmodel-fitting responses occurred early in the CAT procedure (i.e., warm-up effect) the recovery of $\theta$ was very poor. When a warm-up effect was simulated, not only did test length increase but also more examinees were identified as not fitting the model. Using a standard error of less than.20 to terminate the CAT resulted in estimated $\theta$ values that were biased and poorly estimated. Finally, the entry point used in the CAT administration did not seem to affect final ability estimates. Future research should consider developing new indices to quantify the extent to which examinees fit the test model within the CAT environment, and new methods of simulated nonmodel-fitting response patterns within CAT.

AB  - Whether the presence of bidimensionality has any effect on the adaptive recalibration of test items was studied through live-data simulation of computer adaptive testing (CAT) forms. The source data were examinee responses to the 298 scored multiple choice items of a licensure examination in a health care profession. Three 75-item part-forms, differing in the degree of bidimensionality, were constructed from the examination forms. The dimensionality of each item was determined based on principal factor loadings using W. F. Stout's (1987) procedure. Samples of 2,100 examinees from an U.S.-educated group and a predominantly foreign-educated group were used, with samples sizes of 100, 200, 400, and 1,000 used for the analyses. As expected, an increase in sample size resulted in greater agreement between calibration and bank b-values. It appeared that dimensionality affected adaptive recalibration. Results from this study varied depending on the dimensionality of the part-forms. Results also affirm the importance of a well-defined reference group for recalibration, since samples from varying ability ranges sometimes produced considerably different b-values. Three tables present details of the analyses. (Contains six references.) (SLD)

AB  - While the psychometric and statistical models underlying the design of computer adaptive tests (CAT) are well understood, relatively few working models exist for the purpose of foreign language assessment. Likewise, little has been published concerning the practical considerations affecting the implementation of such tests. in the process of constructing the Monash/Melbourne French CAT, we discovered much about putting testing theory into practice. The present paper reports this experience in three parts. In a preliminary section, we describe the academic context in which the French CAT was created and trialed. This is followed by a detailed consideration of the test presentation platform and operating algorithms. Lastly, we give an evaluation of the first administration of the French CAT, accompanied by a discussion of the test's reliability and validity as a placement instrument for first year Australian university students.

AB  - The relationship between several individual difference variables and test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was studied with 208 South Korean college students. The general individual difference variable selected was test anxiety, and the math-related individual difference variables were mathematics aptitude, math test anxiety, and math self-concept. Computer-related individual difference variables were computer literacy, computer anxiety, and computer experience. The CAT was an algebra test. Test anxiety and other individual difference variables were measured with instruments translated into Korean for the study. The seven difference variables and their squares were submitted to an analysis using the RSQUARE Procedure from Statistical Analysis System software. Math aptitude, math self-concept, math test anxiety, and computer literacy, in that order, were significantly related to test performance using CAT, but test anxiety, computer experience, and computer anxiety were not. Results suggest that the relationship between individual difference variables and test performance using CAT may be curvilinear. Two tables present analysis results. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - Educational technology has been a focus of development and research in science teaching and learning. This document reviews research dealing with computer and hypermedia applications to assessment in science education. The paper reports the findings first for computer applications for assessment and then for hypermedia applications in assessment. Computer applications include access to large test banks, evaluation of student data collected in laboratory exercises, microcomputer-administered diagnostic testing, effects of computer use on student motivation during computer-administered tests, and computerized adaptive testing. Hypermedia applications include interactive videodisc technology for teaching biology, assessing teachers' knowledge for certification purposes, problem-based learning in chemistry found in the "Hyperequation" project, and administering figural response test items to cell and molecular biology students. The summary describes three advantages for incorporating computer-assisted assessment: immediate student feedback, ease of test taking, and availability of another form of formative assessment. Users of computer-assisted assessment are cautioned that computer-generated tests can lull the teacher into simply testing low level recall knowledge, and that the linear nature of computer testing does not allow the student to go back and reflect upon particular items.

CY  - NA
AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

The agenda for this research was (1) to compare a computer adaptive test (CAT) with paper and pencil (PAP) tests in terms of the comparability of item calibrations and the comparability of examinee ability estimates and (2) to examine the CAT under varying test conditions to determine whether modifications in traditional test design affect examinee performance. Results show that PAP item calibrations were functionally equivalent to the CAT item calibrations even though items on the CAT were administered to varying numbers of examinees and appeared in different contexts for different examinees. Examinees performed comparably on the CAT and the PAP as evidenced by a.83 correlation, adjusted for measurement error, and a mean difference of.01 across the two modes of administration. There were no significant differences between the CAT and the PAP ability estimates due to sex, ethnic origin, age or whether or not English was the examinee's first language. On the CAT, examinees were randomly placed in test design conditions in which the effects of altering the difficulty of the start, the difficulty of the test, the minimum test length and the option to skip, defer or review items were examined. There were no significant differences in examinee performance across these groups indicating that some of these design options may be viable for CAT. Test length was reduced on the CAT without sacrificing confidence in the pass/fail decision. Test length on the PAP was 109 items; mean test length on the CAT was 66 items when the maximum test length was set at 100 items and 86 items when the maximum test length was set at 240 items. Results from this study indicate that CAT can be an excellent way to administer certification exams. Examinees can benefit by being able to take shorter exams, scheduled at their convenience and receive immediate test results. For the certification board, CAT can improve data collection and test security, and provide greater confidence in pass/fail decisions.

AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty. The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data. Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

TI  - Linguistic predictors of SAT antonym item difficulty: Identification and employment

AB  - This research investigates the extent to which linguistic features of standardized test antonym items can be used to predict the empirical difficulty of these items. The study was motivated by both theoretical and practical considerations. Theoretically, exploring content-feature correlates of difficulty is a form of construct validation as such inquiry attends to the question of why an item is easy or difficult. The pursuit of evidential links between content and difficulty is a scientific, falsifiable approach to validation. In contrast, conventional response-based analyses do not address the central role played by item content in controlling difficulty. From a practical standpoint, detecting content-based predictors allows for the scaling of similarly constructed items without having to establish difficulty measurements via pretesting. Twelve variables associated with stem and keyed answer words of 975 published SAT antonym items are considered. Results reveal that the stem word's standard frequency index (SFI) is the most robust predictor of empirical difficulty (as measured by Educational Testing Service's equated delta statistic), distantly followed by the keyed answer word's SFI and part of speech. Across all items, one-third of difficulty variance was explained by this predictor set, confirming the frequency-difficulty relationship reported in studies employing more common words and smaller samples. Prediction was attenuated by the relatively high proportion of words having low frequencies. Presumably, a larger representation of familiar words and more differentiated low frequency values would significantly improve prediction. These findings suggest that feature-based scaling is an efficient, cost effective means for advancing local development of adaptive assessment systems. A computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system is suggested as one practical, psychometric application of the study's findings. The proposed system would extract verbal stimuli from an electronic word domain and employ the aforementioned word variables as proxies for vocabulary item difficulty. Among the design issues discussed are the automatic construction of vocabulary items, adaptive branching, sequential decision-making, iterative refinement of item calibrations, and the provision of timely output for formative direction of learning and instruction.

CY  - United States -- New York
AB  - The loudness of quasi continuous impulse noise has been studied as a function of impulse duration and repetition rate, and the spectral shape and relative level of steady background noise. The measurements were performed on 1-second trains of white-noise bursts with exponentially decaying envelopes. The repetition rates were 5 to 100 Hz. The impulse durations were adjusted so that the duty factor of the impulse train (product of the repetition rate and the effective duration of the impulses) varied from 0.025 to 0.1. Steady white background noise was added at peak-to-background ratios of 10, 20 and 30 dB. The loudness levels of the stimuli relative to a steady white noise reference stimulus at a presentation level of 60.5 dB L$\sb{\rm eq}$ were measured in ten normal-hearing subjects using an adaptive testing procedure. Under most conditions, the loudness levels of the quasi continuous impulse noise stimuli were best predicted by the equivalent sound pressure level, L$\sb{\rm eq}$, indicating that the "equal energy" relation was followed. At the 50 and 100-Hz repetition rates, the loudness level of the impulse noise test stimuli at the 20 and 30-dB peak-to-background ratios exceeded that of the reference stimulus due to the "roughness effect". The loudness levels of the stimuli at the lower repetition rates, on the other hand, was significantly less than the equal energy prediction at the shortest durations, which suggests that auditory temporal integration depends on the duty factor of the impulse train. The data of experiment 1 were fit by a simple model involving the duty factor of the impulse train and the difference between the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the impulsive component and the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the steady background noise component of the test stimuli. In the second experiment, the spectral shape of the background noise did not significantly affect the point of subjective equality. However, there was a significant interaction between background noise spectrum and peak-to-background noise ratio which was suggestive of a masking process.

AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

AB  - Stress-strain curves, generated through continuous and multistage torsion tests of as-cast and homogenized 301, 304, 316 and 317 $\gamma$ stainless steels in the range of 1200-900$\sp\circ$C and 0.1 to 5.0 s$\sp{\rm -1}$, were analyzed with respect to the characteristics of work hardening, dynamic and static recovery, dynamic and static recrystallization, and ductility. Work hardening was related to the Kocks-Mecking analysis. The associated enthalpy which rose across the deformation range attaining a maximum at the highest temperature, was in close agreement with the constant activation energy determined by sinh analysis. Dynamic softening mechanisms were analyzed through examination of the flow curves, with conclusions based upon mechanical data being confirmed by optical metallographic methods. Upon attaining a critical strain, dynamic recrystallization DRX was initiated, producing a peak and then softening to a steady state regime. The rate of dynamic softening was determined by means of the Avrami equation. The critical stress and strain for subgrain formation and for DRX were determined from changes in slope of the strain hardening-flow stress $\theta$-$\sigma$ curves. A transition from multiple peak grain coarsening to single peak grain refinement behavior was observed and analyzed. Static restorative mechanisms were examined by mechanical metallographic methods. Fractional softening was due to both static recovery SRV and static recrystallization SRX. The kinetics were analyzed through use of the Avrami equation. At low strains, the time for 50% SRX was a strong function of strain to the $-2$ power. In addition, the temperature compensated time for SRX depended upon the three-eights power of the Zener-Hollomon parameter for both isothermal and declining temperature T multistage tests. Simulation of a cross country mill showed that multistage flow curves increased as strain rate rose and as interval time and T declined, particularly below 1050$\sp\circ$C. Since the time between successive planetary rolls is insufficient for any restorative mechanisms to operate, the instantaneous power requirements for the planetary hot rolling mill were determined from continuous flow curves. The results favorably agreed with similar mills installed in both Canada and Japan.

AB  - The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was evaluated for Item Response Theory (IRT) assumptions, local independence and parameter invariance in order to determine the feasibility of developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version. Three conditions were studied including two simulated CAT versions and a standard version (Form R). A sex difference was noted across all groups, but item order did not otherwise affect scores which were highly correlated with the IRT based scores. After excluding those items which did not fit the model, the local independence assumption generally held across groups, and since the procedure used to assess local independence was also sensitive to multidimensionality, this provides implied support for unidimensionality of the various scales. The procedures used to investigate item order effects and parameter invariance yielded mixed results. Overall, this study provides evidence favorable to a CAT adaptation of the MMPI, and suggestions for further research are discussed.

PB  - Colorado State University
CY  - United States -- Colorado
AB  - The shear strength of remolded specimens of an unsaturated, silty, copper tailings sand was measured in a triaxial apparatus. Multistage tests were completed under consolidated-drained (CD) conditions, where both the pore air and pore water pressures were controlled, and under constant water content (CW) conditions, where the specimen was drained with respect to the pore air pressure and undrained with respect to the pore water pressure. A triaxial testing system with automatic data capturing capabilities was assembled for the study. A total of eight specimens were tested, two in a saturated condition and three each under unsaturated CD and CW conditions, respectively. The saturated specimens were staged with respect to increasing effective stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$), while each unsaturated specimen was tested with a constant value of net applied stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$), and increasing values of matric suction (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) from stage to stage. The range of net applied stress and matric suction studied was 15 to 150 kPa. The parameter $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ quantifies the increase in shear strength which can be attributed to the matric suction stress state variable. The results indicated that the intersection of the failure surface with the plane containing the (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) axis was curved over the range of suction studied, and did not differ appreciably between the CD and CW test methods. This demonstrated uniqueness of the failure surface. When account was made for a slight curvature in the failure surface in the direction of the ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$) axis, the variation in $\phi\sp\prime$ with respect to (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) was reduced. This supported the concept of independence of the shear strength parameters $\phi\sp\prime$, c$\sp\prime$, and $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ for unsaturated soils, and verified the form of the shear strength equation used in the study (Fredlund, Morgenstern, and Widger, 1978).

AB  - The major objective of this investigation was to test experimentally the relative validity of simulating hot strip rolling by compression testing at constant true strain rates under axisymmetric conditions. For the purpose of the simulation, the material's flow through the roll gap was theoretically modelled. Isothermal, single- and multi-stage compression tests were carried out on a microprocessor-controlled servohydraulic testing system by using a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel. Cylindrical specimens were subjected to deformation at rates of strain either constant or varying as during a rolling pass/passes. True stress-true strain flow curves were obtained by correcting the measured stress-strain data for the effect of friction at the specimen/die interface. The constant friction shear factor was determined quantitatively by hot ring tests. Optical microscopy was used to observe the prior austenite microstructures. Based on the results of single-stage, constant true strain-rate tests, the dependence of the flow strength as a function of strain, rate of strain and temperature was modelled by using an Arrhenius-type equation. The comparison of the responses of the material to the two types of compression revealed no significant differences between flow curves except at the very end of the tests. This observation agreed with the predictions of the model, which was developed based on the constant strain-rate flow curves, indicating that the material follows a mechanical equation of state in hot rolling processes. The flow curves and the average flow strengths were compared between the constant and varying strain-rate, four-stage tests. Differences were also found negligible. The variation of the average flow strength during multistage testing was dependent of the length of the interpass time and the average strain rate in a significant manner. It was found that the microstructures developed from single- as well as multi-stage compression tests were independent of the variation of the strain rate during deformation. This study showed that the constant true strain-rate compression testing is a very useful technique in simulating hot flat strip rolling processes.

CY  - United States -- New Mexico
AB  - This study focused on the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in remedial mathematics when compared with tutoring and independent-study as methods of instruction. In this investigation, the relationship between these three methods of instruction and the ethnicity of the subjects was explored. Results were measured by analyzing differences in achievement scores as measured by Computer Adaptive Testing and Comparative Guidance Placement. The results showed that there was a significant difference between minority and non-minorities for both tutoring and independent-study. Such differences are frequently encountered and are generally attributable to cultural differences or prior educational experiences, which may cause some minority students to experience emotional and value conflicts in the classroom. This could result in psychological defenses being called into play. No significant differences in test scores were apparent between minorities and non-minorities when using CAI as the method of instruction, indicating that CAI may not activate such defenses. Results also showed that minorities scored significantly higher in testing after using CAI as a method of instruction than after using tutoring or independent-study methods. This suggests that CAI, when used for remedial instruction in basic skills mathematics, reduces the frequently encountered differences in achievement between minorities and non-minorities. This supports the theory that CAI is multicultural and a value-neutral tool that can assist to alleviate some of these pre-existing problems, thereby enabling minority students to attain greater academic success.

AB  - The value of statistical research depends on valid comparisons which can usefully influence educational policy. Educational research needs to extend the measures of learning (such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress) through nationally-calibrated absolute measures and through computer-assisted and adaptive testing. Direct sampling by computer would make educational polls and national assessment faster and less expensive. A national bureau of educational standards might be founded to collect, coordinate, calibrate, archive, analyze, synthesize, and make available the data that is needed to improve educational productivity. Nine factors promoting efficiency and productivity of learning are classified in three broad categories: (1) student aptitude, including ability, development, and motivation; (2) instruction, including amount of time students engage in learning and quality of instructional experience; and (3) environmental factors, such as home climate, classroom social group, peer group, and television viewing. The tables in the appendix illustrate the effect of productivity factors on achievement revealed by quantitative syntheses carried out by a number of investigators in Australia, Canada and the United States during the past decade.

AB  - Feedback is a key element in the teaching/learning cycle. It tells teachers and students how they are progressing and how effective their instruction/learning has been. Despite the importance of feedback, it is rarely obtained in optimal ways and is poorly understood by teachers and students. The problem lies in ineffective methods of obtaining and utilizing feedback information. This study has attempted to define, implement, and determine the effects of a set of rational measurement practices. It is based on the premise that testing should be an integral part of teaching, providing information to students and teachers in an efficient and non-intrusive manner. The components for rational measurement include well-written item sets which communicate teachers'expectations to students, individualized selection of items, detailed comments on student answers, and reports portraying the changing relationship of students to items as instruction proceeds. The system utilizes a microcomputer programmed with an algorithm for Rasch measurement and adaptive testing. Nine classes participated in a study of the effectiveness of the system. After training, each teacher wrote item sets corresponding to two units. Qualitative data were gathered on teachers' use of measurement information for improving teaching practice. Teacher proficiency in writing items was measured. Students within classes were randomly assigned to four groups created by the crossing of a feedback factor and an item selection factor. Students were tested weekly with subsets of items from the set written by the teacher. Ability measures were obtained from each session to determine whether detailed feedback was effective in raising achievement. Attitude and anxiety data were collected at the beginning and end of each unit to assess whether adaptive item selection caused a more positive student reaction to testing. Data analysis showed that four teachers used the system to improve their teaching. Three teachers displayed positive verbal responses, but did not change practices. Two teachers did not use the measurement information. There was no discernible increase in item-writing proficiency. Analysis of student data showed a nonsignificant positive effect of detailed feedback on student achievement. No difference between selection or feedback groups was observed for any affective measures.

AB  - The object of this research programme was to investigate the stability of a silty clay under undrained repeated loading. Equipment has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading. This model can be used to predict pore pressures and failure for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils.

AB  - For the training of academic skills, digital educational games with integrated adaptivity are promising. Adaptive games are considered superior to non-adaptive games, because they constantly assess children's performance, and accordingly adapt the difficulty of the tasks corresponding to the children's individual level. However, empirical evidence with regard to the effectivity of adaptive compared to non-adaptive games is limited. A study was conducted with 191 children from the third year of Kindergarten who were enrolled in one of three conditions, that is, playing an adaptive version of the reading game (RG), a non-adaptive version of the RG or training with pen-and-paper exercises. In all three conditions, children trained emergent reading (phonological awareness and letter knowledge) once a week for 30?min over a period of 5?weeks. Children's performance on cognitive (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, reading fluency) and non-cognitive (motivation, self-concept) factors was assessed. Results revealed a significant improvement in phonological awareness and letter knowledge in all conditions. However, no differences between the conditions were observed with respect to children's improvement on phonological awareness and letter knowledge or on their post-test scores for reading fluency. With regard to motivation and self-concept, again, no differences in these non-cognitive factors were observed across conditions.

AB  - Background: The importance of reading motivation has led to the development of a large number of self-report reading motivation measures; however, there is still a need for a usable measure of adolescent reading motivation that captures a large number of theoretically and empirically distinct constructs. Methods: The current paper details the development and validation of a computer adapted measure of reading motivation, the Adaptive Reading Motivation Measure (ARMM), which assesses constructs of curiosity, involvement, interest, value, challenge, grades, recognition, competition, avoidance, self-efficacy, perceived difficulty, preference for autonomy, social motivation, prosocial goals, and antisocial goals for reading. Results: Model fit indicated that hierarchical multidimensional models fit better than models without a hierarchical structure. The validation results indicate that females scored higher than males and younger students scored higher than older students on most ARMM scores when scores were derived using a higher-order model. In addition, these scores correlated significantly to reading behavior, engagement, and achievement and indicated high reliability. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the ARMM would be a valid measure to assess a large number of reading motivation constructs in a short period of time within a classroom setting.

AB  - A decision of whether to move from paper-and-pencil to computer-based tests is based largely on a careful weighing of the potential benefits of a change against its costs, disadvantages, and challenges. This paper briefly discusses the trade-offs involved in making such a transition, and then focuses on a relatively unexplored benefit of computer-based tests -- the control of construct-irrelevant factors that can threaten test score validity. Several unique advantages provided by computer-based tests are described, and how these advantages can be used to manage the effects of several common construct-irrelevant factors is discussed. Ultimately, the potential for expanded control may prove to be one of the most important benefits of computer-based tests.

AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone<c2><a9> crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

AB  - Background The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Methods All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. Results The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170 <c2><b1> 67 s (average <c2><b1> Stdev) to answer 25 <c2><b1> 6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R2 values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R2 values of 0.5236. Conclusions PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - This study estimated male-female and Black-White achievement gaps without accounting for low test motivation, then compared those estimates to ones that used several approaches to addressing rapid guessing. Researchers investigated two issues: (1) The differences in rates of rapid guessing across subgroups and (2) How much achievement gap estimates change when rapid guessing is addressed. The study used reading and mathematics scores from the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), a test administered in nearly all U.S. states. Results suggest that rapid guessing occurs at very different rates across subgroups. However, rapid guessing generally has a mild effect on gaps estimates, although there are cases where failing to account for low test motivation may be impacting fundamental inferences made based on gaps. As part of the second question, differences across approaches to accounting for rapid guessing were examined. Results suggest that rapid guessing occurs at very different rates across subgroups. However, rapid guessing generally has a mild effect on gaps estimates, although there are cases where failing to account for low test motivation may be impacting fundamental inferences made based on gaps.

AB  - The clinical assessment of mental disorders can be a time-consuming and error-prone procedure, consisting of a sequence of diagnostic hypothesis formulation and testing aimed at restricting the set of plausible diagnoses for the patient. In this article, we propose a novel computerized system for the adaptive testing of psychological disorders. The proposed system combines a mathematical representation of psychological disorders, known as the "formal psychological assessment," with an algorithm designed for the adaptive assessment of an individual's knowledge. The assessment algorithm is extended and adapted to the new application domain. Testing the system on a real sample of 4,324 healthy individuals, screened for obsessive-compulsive disorder, we demonstrate the system's ability to support clinical testing, both by identifying the correct critical areas for each individual and by reducing the number of posed questions with respect to a standard written questionnaire.

AB  - This study examined the utility of response time-based analyses in understanding the behavior of unmotivated test takers. For the data from an adaptive achievement test, patterns of observed rapid-guessing behavior and item response accuracy were compared to the behavior expected under several types of models that have been proposed to represent unmotivated test taking behavior. Test taker behavior was found to be inconsistent with these models, with the exception of the effort-moderated model. Effort-moderated scoring was found to both yield scores that were more accurate than those found under traditional scoring, and exhibit improved person fit statistics. In addition, an effort-guided adaptive test was proposed and shown by a simulation study to alleviate item difficulty mistargeting caused by unmotivated test taking.

PB  - University of Johannesburg (South Africa)
CY  - South Africa
AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

AB  - Distance education is a discipline that offers solutions to some important education problems. Distance education, contribute to the solution to the problems such as; inequality of opportunities, lifelong education, the implementation of a series of individual and social goals that can contribute to and benefit from educational technology and self-learning. In distance education, methods of measurement and assessment must be consistent with the objectives and contents of teaching. A major interest of formative assessment is determining the students' learning level of each behavior in the interested unit. In summative assessment, performances of students on some units are measured broader than formative assessment. A computerized adaptive testing, CAT, is the test managed by computer in which each item is introduced and the decision to stop are dynamically imposed based on the students answers and his/her estimated knowledge level. In CAT applications, students do not take the same test. Despite item numbers and properties of items are different for the students; the precise of measures improves in positioning students on an ability or success continuum in CAT applications. In CAT applications, questions answered by a student depend on the student's ability or learning level. In item response theory, there are some models to estimate a student's ability level, such as three-parameter logistic model. Cheating in exams or other academic assignments can be defined as use resources not allowed to use or having someone else to take exams or assignments. Some precautions must be taken about cheating such as a live proctoring, using web cams, and using a plagiarism detection program.

AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

AB  - The ability to screen quickly and thoroughly for psychological difficulties in existing and returning combat veterans who are seeking treatment for physical ailments would be of significant benefit. In the current study, item and time savings, as well as extratest correlations, associated with an audio-augmented version of the computerized adaptive Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2-CA) are examined in a group of 273 male veterans, ages 26-87 years. Results indicated an average item savings of approximately 103 items (18.6%), with a corresponding time savings of approximately 12 min (24.3%), for the MMPI-2-CA compared with conventional computerized administration of the test, as well as comparability in terms of test-retest coefficients and correlations with external measures. Future directions of adaptive personality testing are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  - Increased use of course management software to administer course exams online for face-to-face classes raises the question of how well test anxiety and other emotions generalize from the classroom to an online setting. We hypothesized that administering regular course exams in an online format would reduce test anxiety experienced at the time of the exam and improve exam scores. We recruited 69 participants from a psychology course to take classroom- and online-delivered exams, using a counterbalanced crossover design. We found that students who normally experience high levels of test anxiety in the classroom had reduced test anxiety when taking online exams, while the reverse was true for those low in classroom anxiety. Furthermore, the relationship between test anxiety and exam performance was weaker in an online setting than in the classroom. We recommend that instructors evaluate the potential impact of these findings when considering offering examinations online. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

This article describes types of conative feedback that can support the student's conation, will, volition, or motivation. Any of these types of feedback can be presented to the student before, during, or after an educational activity or a test question. Experimental results found higher student scores using conative feedback during computer-based assessment than without feedback. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - This article discusses the growing interest in computer-adaptive testing, which supporters say can help guide instruction, increase student motivation, and determine the best use of resources for districts. This method of testing shortens the test by not asking high-achieving students questions that are too easy for them, and likewise not giving struggling students questions that are too hard. However, computer-adaptive assessments are not the best way to evaluate students in every situation, experts point out. Though, they recognize the potential of computer-adaptive testing, experts also voice caution in using this kind of method.

AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

CY  - United States -- California
AB  - The ability to predict the performance of student nurse anesthetists on the Computer Adaptive Testing National Certification Examination (CAT NCE) is an area of concern and interest to nurse anesthesia educators, students, nurse anesthesia administrators, clinicians, and employers. Upon completion of an accredited nurse anesthesia education program, students must successfully pass the CAT NCE in order to practice as a nurse anesthetist. One of the major outcomes of the education of student nurse anesthetists is to provide the community of interest with safe, competent anesthesia practitioners who can pass the CAT NCE. This study examined 13 academic, demographic, and pre-admission factors, which predict performance on the CAT NCE. This retrospective study reviewed the academic records of 128 student nurse anesthetists who took the CAT NCE between 1996 and 2003. The independent variables included the following: Baccalaureate of Science Degree in Nursing (BSN), nurse anesthesia program grade point average (GPA), age, gender, type of nursing background, number of years of nursing, type of BSN program (traditional, completion), and number of clinical cases and case hours in the nurse anesthesia program. The dependent variable was overall CAT NCE score. Results of the multiple regression analysis determined that 2 of the 13 independents variables were predictive of student performance on the CAT NCE. These variables included BSN GPA and type of BSN program, which accounted for 15.5% of the variance in overall CAT NCE scores. In addition, a strong positive correlation existed between BSN GPA and CAT NCE scores. All of the other remaining variables showed no significance in the multiple regression or correlation analyses. The results of this study will be used to examine and further define the admission criteria and curriculum requirements for nurse anesthesia education programs. In the computerized version of the NCE, each candidate's examination is individualized, allowing the results of the examination to be based on the student's individual knowledge, skills, and abilities to determine individual competence. The computer adaptive version of the NCE more precisely determines competence by testing each individual according to his or her abilities.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that, when administered a self-adapted test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a self-adapted test--lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT)--can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted self-adapted test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only in the region of their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class. The results show that while the RS-AT effectively controlled the standard errors of proficiency estimation, examinees receiving an RS-AT did not show higher mean proficiency or lower posttest state anxiety than examinees receiving a CAT.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

The two groups (motivated and non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) under the counterbalanced design at the computer laboratory. They were also given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale, a 10-item computer test anxiety scale, and a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing. A multivariate analysis of covariance, with the math aptitude and the test anxiety as covariates, demonstrated that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes.

AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance. Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables. This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance. The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

AB  - In self-adapted testing (SAT), examinees select the difficulty level of items administered. This study investigated three variations of prior information provided when taking an SAT: (1) no information (examinees selected item difficulty levels without prior information); (2) view (examinees inspected a typical item from each difficulty level prior to taking the SAT); and (3) route (examinees answered a typical item from each difficulty level and were informed prior to the SAT of the level that best matched their performance). Subjects were 218 students in an introductory statistics course, 85 percent of whom were undergraduates. No significant differences in test performance or anxiety were found as a function of providing examinees more information. Four tables are included. (Contains 9 references.) (Author/SLD)

Subjects were 379 college students. A disordinal interaction was found between test type and locus of control. Examinees with an internal locus of control were affected positively by the SAT (relative to the CAT). For examinees with an external locus of control, however, the SAT appeared to have a negative effect on both estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. There are four tables and two figures.

AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - Research on the major computerized adaptive testing (CAT) strategies is reviewed, and some findings are reported that examine effects of examinee demographic and psychological characteristics on CAT strategies. In fixed branching strategies, all examinees respond to a common routing test, the score of which is used to assign examinees to a second-stage test. The currently popular statistically branched adaptive strategies are based on item-response theory, and include maximum likelihood strategy and Bayesian strategy. Two alternative strategies are the use of self-adapted testing and testlet strategies. Examinee characteristic variables are divided into: (1) demographic variables; (2) computer-use variables; (3) test-taking strategy variables; (4) cognitive characteristics; and (5) affective characteristics. Although research on the relationship between examinee psychological characteristics and CAT has been inconclusive, the basic findings are that examinees of different ethnic, gender, age, grade, ability, academic self-concept, test anxiety, computer anxiety, math anxiety, and computer experience groups are differentially affected by the adaptive testing strategies. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (Contains 67 references.) (SLD)

AB  - A new testing strategy that provides protection against the problem of having examinees in adaptive testing choose difficulty levels that are not matched to their proficiency levels was introduced and evaluated. The method, termed restricted self-adapted testing (RSAT), still provides examinees with a degree of control over the difficulty levels of their test items. The range of item choice is restricted to a region around the examinee's current proficiency estimate. Participants in this study were 186 students in grades 3 through 8 in the Portland (Oregon) Public School system during the winter of 1992-93, who were tested as part of an ongoing computerized adaptive testing program. Students were randomly assigned to a computerized adaptive test (CAT), a self-adaptive test (SADT), or RSAT in mathematics. Results indicate no differences between CAT and SADT conditions in terms of mean proficiency and mean posttest state anxiety. The basic RSAT method appears to hold promise for providing examinees with control over the testing situation, while preventing large mismatches between item difficulty choice and proficiency level. The RSAT procedure should be evaluated empirically. (SLD)

AB  - This study assessed whether providing examinees with a choice between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and self-adaptive testing (SAT) affects test performance in comparison with being assigned a CAT or SAT, and evaluated variables influencing examinee choice of either test form. The relative influences of test type and test choice on examinee anxiety were also examined. Subjects were 244 undergraduate and 133 graduate students from a large midwestern university. Students were randomly assigned to SAT, CAT, and choice conditions for an algebra test. Test-related anxiety was assessed with a paper-and-pencil measure in pretests and posttests. It was found that, for students with high mathematics anxiety, providing a choice between CAT and SAT led to significantly higher mean proficiency estimates, lending support to the hypothesis that examinees can cope with a stressful situation more effectively if they feel that they have some control over the source of the stress. Expected differences in estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety between CAT and SAT conditions were not found, but a strong relationship was seen between examinee test type choice and mathematics anxiety level. Higher anxiety examinees have a greater preference for the control provided by SAT. Six tables and two graphs summarize findings. (SLD)

AB  - Purpose of study. This study was to determine if nursing candidates for licensure experienced an increase in anxiety due to the administration of an examination by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second purpose was to discover if certain groups were "at risk" of experiencing computer test anxiety. Method. This study was a two-group, experimental design conducted concurrently with the CAT-NCLEX simulation. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing selected practical nursing graduates and repeat examinees to participate in a field test of the Computerized Adaptive Testing of the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The experimental group for this study participated in the CAT simulation activity prior to taking NCLEX-PN and the control group did so after NCLEX-PN. Both groups completed a 17 item Self-Report Anxiety Questionnaire. The responses were summed; the total score was considered to be a measure of anxiety. Findings. Analysis of the data indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in computer test anxiety between the two groups. This is not to infer that there was no computer test anxiety expressed but rather that there was virtually no difference in the level of anxiety reported by the experimental group and the control group. Further analysis of data indicated that persons with previous computer experience reported higher levels of computer test anxiety than those without previous computer experience and that females reported themselves as experiencing higher levels of computer test anxiety than did males. The results did not indicate that minorities experienced higher levels of computer test anxiety than non-minority groups. Lastly, there was no correlation between nursing grade point average or age and levels of computer test anxiety. Conclusion. Participation in a computerized testing simulation did not affect the level of computer test anxiety. The only groups to experience higher levels of computer test anxiety are females and those with previous computer experience.

AB  - Little research exists on the psychological impacts of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and how it may affect test performance. Three CAT procedures were examined, in which items were selected to match students' achievement levels, from the item pool at random, or according to student choice of item difficulty levels. Twenty-four graduate students (5 males and 19 females) at Indiana University (Richmond) were randomly assigned to one of six testing orders formed by the three mastery test approaches and by blocking on native and non-native speakers. While at a computer, students received a description of adaptive testing methods and then a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. Right after completing each test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale, ranked their preferences among tests, and evaluated their performance on each of the tests. No statistically significant mean differences were found among mean student achievement scores or among in-test anxiety means under the three adaptive testing methods. Students reporting higher anxiety scored significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Those preferring the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most were less anxious during those tests. Instead of actual performance, students' perceptions of how well they did were significantly correlated with preference rankings for the tests. The matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach decisions than did the random-selection tests. Ten tables, 1 figure, and a 19-item list of references are included.

AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

AB  - Computerized adaptive (CA) testing uses an algorithm to match examinee ability to item difficulty, while self-adapted (SA) testing allows the examinee to choose the difficulty of his or her items. Research comparing SA and CA testing has shown that examinees experience lower anxiety and improved performance with SA testing. All previous research concerning SA testing has presented item feedback to the examinee before asking the examinee to choose the next item difficulty level. Moreover, item feedback has typically not been presented to examinees in previous CA testing research. The effects of presenting, versus withholding, item feedback in SA tests were studied for 135 graduate and 228 undergraduate students (128 males and 235 females). The instrument was a computerized algebra test to assess skills needed for a statistics class. Examinees administered the SA tests tended to obtain significantly higher ability estimates than did those who were administered the CA tests. Also, those taking the SA tests reported significantly lower post-test state anxiety than did those taking the CA tests. Interaction between test type and feedback was not found, suggesting that examinees are able to use the implicit feedback they receive when answering items. Five tables present study findings. (SLD)

CY  - United States -- Pennsylvania
AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty. The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data. Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

AB  - The strategies examinees employ when making item difficulty level choices in self-adapted computerized testing were investigated. Subjects were 148 college students (88 females and 60 males) in an introductory statistics course. The primary instrument was a self-adapted computerized algebra test used to measure student readiness for the statistics course. Each examinee was administered 20 items from a pool of 93. Students rated their self-efficacy before the test and were administered measures of mathematics anxiety and test anxiety. Inspection of each student's data file provided an indicator of selection strategy. Examinees who chose a more difficult first test item expressed greater capability and higher confidence, reported less anxiety just prior to testing, and less anxiety about mathematics in general. When selecting additional items, examinees tended toward what was termed a sluggishly flexible strategy; they chose more difficult items after passing an item or string of items, and chose less difficult items after failing a single item or string of items. The most frequent choice was to remain at the same level. Results indicate that self-adaptive testing may be a viable alternative to computerized adaptive testing. Two figures and two tables contain data from the study. (SLD)

AB  - According to item response theory (IRT), examinee ability estimation is independent of the particular set of test items administered from a calibrated pool. Although the most popular application of this feature of IRT is computerized adaptive (CA) testing, a recently proposed alternative is self-adapted (SA) testing, in which examinees choose the difficulty level of each of their test items. Examinee performance was compared under CA and SA testing conditions for college students from an introductory statistics course. Three test forms were developed, testing mathematical knowledge necessary for the course. The final pool contained 93 items which were administered to 204 subjects. The SA test yielded significantly higher ability scores, and examinees taking the SA test reported significantly lower posttest state anxiety. Implications of the differences between the two test types for measurement practice are discussed. Three tables present study data. (Author/SLD)

AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

AB  - Fifth and sixth grade children were assigned to three pretesting conditions: a full-length pretest, an adaptive pretest that exited learners when nonmastery was indicated, and a no pretest control. Learners in the adaptive treatment demonstrated higher levels of performance on the posttest and had greater motivation to continue the instruction. (24 references) (DB)

AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection). Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited. No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.

AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

AB  - In self-adapted testing, examinees are allowed to choose the difficulty of each item to be presented immediately before attempting it. Previous research has demonstrated that self-adapted testing leads to better performance than do fixed-order tests and is preferred by examinees. The present study examined the strategies that 29 college students used in selecting items during a self-adapted test. After completing the Test Anxiety Inventory, subjects took the self-adapted test. The test contained 40 items sorted into 8 categories of difficulty based on Rasch model estimates. Three test-taking strategies were identified. Most subjects adopted a flexible strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and harder items following success. Some subjects adopted a "failure intolerant" strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and items of the same difficulty after success. Finally, some subjects adopted a "failure tolerant" strategy in which they chose items of the same difficulty level after failure, but harder items after success. The failure-tolerant strategy was associated with lower estimated ability than were the other two strategies. This finding may reflect the attributions examinees adopting that strategy make and the effort they expend following failures. The results provide general support for the value of continued development of self-adapted testing. (Author/TJH)

AB  - A pilot study on the development and administration of a test using a spatial reasoning problem, the 15-puzzle, is described. The test utilizes on-line capabilities of a real-time computer to record an examinee's progress on each problem through a sequence of problem-solving "moves", and to collect additional on-line data that might be of relevance to the evaluation of examinee performance. The examinees, 61 students in an introductory psychology class, were required to type a sequence of moves that would bring an array of scrambled numbers (start configuration) into agreement with a second array (goal configuration), using as few moves as possible. Results suggest that four performance indices might be useful in indexing problem difficulty: (1) mean number of moves in the sample; (2) proportion of students solving the problem; (3) proportion of students solving the problem in the optimal number of moves; and (4) a Special Difficulty Index, defined as the sample mean number of moves divided by the minimum number of moves required. Additional methods of scoring test and individual problem performance are studied. (Author/RL)

AB  - Volunteer college students were assigned to one of six computer administered vocabulary tests, one half with immediate knowledge of results (KR) after responding to each item, and the other half without knowledge of results. The six tests were designed to be at one of three levels of difficulty and consisted either of 50 preselected items (conventional testing) or tailored on the basis of previous candidate responses (stradaptive testing). Results indicated that the mean maximum-likelihood estimates of individuals' ability varied as a joint function of the KR condition and of test difficulty. Students in the KR condition scored higher than the other students on the most difficult test and lower on the least difficult test. Questionnaire results indicated that, although the students perceived the differences in test difficulty, there were not shown to be any effects on mean student anxiety or motivation scores attributable to test difficulty alone. Students in general reacted very favorably to receiving immediate knowledge of results and its provision increased the mean level of reported motivation. (Author/CTM)

The 1976 ETS "The Testing Scene: Chaos and Controversy," presents a historical review of events surrounding the testing controversy. In "Test Theory and the Public Interest," Frederic M. Lord suggested three alternatives for solving some of the problems of cultural test bias: weighted scoring techniques, tailored testing, and item sampling. Esther E. Diamond discussed test construction techniques that could alleviate bias, in "Testing: The Baby and the Bath Water Are Still With Us." In "One Man's View of Testing," William Raspberry stated that norming contributes to cultural bias. Thelma T. Daley discussed the effects of testing on students, in "The Student and Testing." In the final paper, "Where Ignorance Is Bliss--'Tis Folly to be Testing," Robert L. Thorndike recommended that tests be evaluated in light of the decisions that will be based upon their results. (BW)

AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

PB  - University of Johannesburg (South Africa)
CY  - South Africa
AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

AB  - The ability to predict the performance of student nurse anesthetists on the Computer Adaptive Testing National Certification Examination (CAT NCE) is an area of concern and interest to nurse anesthesia educators, students, nurse anesthesia administrators, clinicians, and employers. Upon completion of an accredited nurse anesthesia education program, students must successfully pass the CAT NCE in order to practice as a nurse anesthetist. One of the major outcomes of the education of student nurse anesthetists is to provide the community of interest with safe, competent anesthesia practitioners who can pass the CAT NCE. This study examined 13 academic, demographic, and pre-admission factors, which predict performance on the CAT NCE. This retrospective study reviewed the academic records of 128 student nurse anesthetists who took the CAT NCE between 1996 and 2003. The independent variables included the following: Baccalaureate of Science Degree in Nursing (BSN), nurse anesthesia program grade point average (GPA), age, gender, type of nursing background, number of years of nursing, type of BSN program (traditional, completion), and number of clinical cases and case hours in the nurse anesthesia program. The dependent variable was overall CAT NCE score. Results of the multiple regression analysis determined that 2 of the 13 independents variables were predictive of student performance on the CAT NCE. These variables included BSN GPA and type of BSN program, which accounted for 15.5% of the variance in overall CAT NCE scores. In addition, a strong positive correlation existed between BSN GPA and CAT NCE scores. All of the other remaining variables showed no significance in the multiple regression or correlation analyses. The results of this study will be used to examine and further define the admission criteria and curriculum requirements for nurse anesthesia education programs. In the computerized version of the NCE, each candidate's examination is individualized, allowing the results of the examination to be based on the student's individual knowledge, skills, and abilities to determine individual competence. The computer adaptive version of the NCE more precisely determines competence by testing each individual according to his or her abilities.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Korean college students (n=208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (motivated and non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) under the counterbalanced design at the computer laboratory. They were also given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale, a 10-item computer test anxiety scale, and a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing. A multivariate analysis of covariance, with the math aptitude and the test anxiety as covariates, demonstrated that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes.

AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance. Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables. This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance. The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

AB  - Purpose of study. This study was to determine if nursing candidates for licensure experienced an increase in anxiety due to the administration of an examination by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second purpose was to discover if certain groups were "at risk" of experiencing computer test anxiety. Method. This study was a two-group, experimental design conducted concurrently with the CAT-NCLEX simulation. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing selected practical nursing graduates and repeat examinees to participate in a field test of the Computerized Adaptive Testing of the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The experimental group for this study participated in the CAT simulation activity prior to taking NCLEX-PN and the control group did so after NCLEX-PN. Both groups completed a 17 item Self-Report Anxiety Questionnaire. The responses were summed; the total score was considered to be a measure of anxiety. Findings. Analysis of the data indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in computer test anxiety between the two groups. This is not to infer that there was no computer test anxiety expressed but rather that there was virtually no difference in the level of anxiety reported by the experimental group and the control group. Further analysis of data indicated that persons with previous computer experience reported higher levels of computer test anxiety than those without previous computer experience and that females reported themselves as experiencing higher levels of computer test anxiety than did males. The results did not indicate that minorities experienced higher levels of computer test anxiety than non-minority groups. Lastly, there was no correlation between nursing grade point average or age and levels of computer test anxiety. Conclusion. Participation in a computerized testing simulation did not affect the level of computer test anxiety. The only groups to experience higher levels of computer test anxiety are females and those with previous computer experience.

AB  - Little research exists on the psychological impacts of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and how it may affect test performance. Three CAT procedures were examined, in which items were selected to match students' achievement levels, from the item pool at random, or according to student choice of item difficulty levels. Twenty-four graduate students (5 males and 19 females) at Indiana University (Richmond) were randomly assigned to one of six testing orders formed by the three mastery test approaches and by blocking on native and non-native speakers. While at a computer, students received a description of adaptive testing methods and then a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. Right after completing each test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale, ranked their preferences among tests, and evaluated their performance on each of the tests. No statistically significant mean differences were found among mean student achievement scores or among in-test anxiety means under the three adaptive testing methods. Students reporting higher anxiety scored significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Those preferring the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most were less anxious during those tests. Instead of actual performance, students' perceptions of how well they did were significantly correlated with preference rankings for the tests. The matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach decisions than did the random-selection tests. Ten tables, 1 figure, and a 19-item list of references are included.

AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty. The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data. Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection). Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited. No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.

AB  - This article introduces a blocked-design procedure for cognitive diagnosis computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT), which allows examinees to review items and change their answers during test administration. Four blocking versions of the new procedure were proposed. In addition, the impact of several factors, namely, item quality, generating model, block size, and test length, on the classification rates was investigated. Three popular item selection indices in CD-CAT were used and their efficiency compared using the new procedure. An additional study was carried out to examine the potential benefit of item review. The results showed that the new procedure is promising in that allowing item review resulted only in a small loss in attribute classification accuracy under some conditions. Moreover, using a blocked-design CD-CAT is beneficial to the extent that it alleviates the negative impact of test anxiety on examinees<e2><80><99> true performance.

AB  - The McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ - SF) is a measure of pain published in 1987. This dissertation conducts a confirmatory factor analysis of the measure's structure, as well as a calibration of the items on the measure, using Item Response Theory. A total of 1185 patients reporting to two chronic pain care treatment centers completed the MPQ - SF in the course of their admission to treatment. Factor analyses of their data suggests a three-factor solution of 'acute,' 'emotional,' and 'soreness' factors led to a higher order factor of 'pain.' This solution provides an adequate fit for the data. Previously published one and two factor structures did not demonstrate adequate fit in this data set. Unidimensionality in this sample was supported by the presence of a higher order factor of 'Pain.' Items on the measure are calibrated using the two-parameter logistic model. Specifically, item slope and location parameters are calculated for each of the items, and differential item functioning is investigated between four subgroups of data. Performance on the items was contrasted between subgroups differing on gender, pain diagnosis, workers' compensation status and pain coping status using Raju's DFIT methodology. No differential test functioning was found; however, some individual items did display differential item functioning by subgroup. Sample characteristics that contribute to differential item functioning are examined further. Additionally, implications for diagnostic considerations and computer adaptive testing are discussed.

AB  - Current interest in measuring quality of life is generating interest in the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) with Likert-type items. Calibration of an item bank for use in CAT requires collecting responses to a large number of candidate items. However, the number is usually too large to administer to each subject in the calibration sample. The concurrent anchor-item design solves this problem by splitting the items into separate subtests, with some common items across subtests; then administering each subtest to a different sample; and finally running estimation algorithms once on the aggregated data array, from which a substantial number of responses are then missing. Although the use of anchor-item designs is widespread, the consequences of several configuration decisions on the accuracy of parameter estimates have never been studied in the polytomous case. The present study addresses this question by simulation, comparing the outcomes of several alternatives on the configuration of the anchor-item design. The factors defining variants of the anchor-item design are (a) subtest size, (b) balance of common and unique items per subtest, (c) characteristics of the common items, and (d) criteria for the distribution of unique items across subtests. The results of this study indicate that maximizing accuracy in item parameter recovery requires subtests of the largest possible number of items and the smallest possible number of common items; the characteristics of the common items and the criterion for distribution of unique items do not affect accuracy.

AB  - Purpose: In the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), seven domains (Physical Function, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Social Function, and Pain Interference) are packaged together as profiles. Each of these domains can also be assessed using computer adaptive tests (CATs) or short forms (SFs) of varying length (e.g., 4, 6, and 8 items). We compared the accuracy and number of items administrated of CAT versus each SF. Methods: PROMIS instruments are scored using item response theory (IRT) with graded response model and reported as T scores (mean = 50, SD = 10). We simulated 10,000 subjects from the normal distribution with mean 60 for symptom scales and 40 for function scales, and standard deviation 10 in each domain. We considered a subject<e2><80><99>s score to be accurate when the standard error (SE) was less than 3.0. We recorded range of accurate scores (accurate range) and the number of items administrated. Results: The average number of items administrated in CAT was 4.7 across all domains. The accurate range was wider for CAT compared to all SFs in each domain. CAT was notably better at extending the accurate range into very poor health for Fatigue, Physical Function, and Pain Interference. Most SFs provided reasonably wide accurate range. Conclusions: Relative to SFs, CATs provided the widest accurate range, with slightly more items than SF4 and less than SF6 and SF8. Most SFs, especially longer ones, provided reasonably wide accurate range. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Assessing specific personality traits has shown better predictive power of enterprising personality than have broad personality traits. Hitherto, there have been no instruments that evaluate the combination of specific personality traits of enterprising personality in an adaptive format. So, the aim was to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) to assess enterprising personality in young people. Methods: A pool of 161 items was developed and applied to two sets of participants (nâ‚ = 357 students, Mage = 17.89; SDage = 3.26; nâ‚‚ = 2,693 students; Mage = 16.52, SDage = 1.38) using a stratified sampling method. Results: 107 items that assess achievement motivation, risk-taking, innovativeness, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, internal locus of control, and optimism were selected. The assumption of unidimensionality was tested. The CAT demonstrated high precision for a wide range of 8, using a mean of 10 items and demonstrating a relatively low Standard Error (0.378). Conclusions; A brief, valid, and precise instrument was obtained with relevant implications for educational and entrepreneurial contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N = 100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N = 101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool<e2><80><99>s usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare, neurological genetic disorder for which no clinical outcomes assessments (COAs) or conceptual models (CM) have been developed. Objective: This study aimed to identify symptoms and impacts relevant and important in this patient population and develop a conceptual model of AS, and to evaluate the content validity of selected COA instruments with potential for inclusion in clinical studies of AS to capture treatment benefit. Methods: For both concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive interviews (CI), caregivers of children, adolescents, and adults with AS and clinicians with AS experience were targeted. For CI, clinicians discussed the Modified Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (MPOMA-G) and ProtoKinetics Zeno Walkway<e2><84><a2> and caregivers reviewed the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT), the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS), the Aberrant Behavior Checklist<e2><80><93>Community (ABC-C), and the Morning Diary. Results: Four clinicians and 34 caregivers participated in CE interviews; three clinicians and 36 caregivers participated in CI. A conceptual model, initially informed by literature, was refined based on interview data. Five domains of symptoms, signs, and characteristics of AS were identified: cognitive and executive functioning, social-emotional, emotional-expressive behavior, sensory-compulsive behavior, and physical. Patient impacts were identified in three domains: activities of daily living, school, and social/community. Caregiver impacts were identified in five domains: mental health, physical health, work, home, and social. While all instruments demonstrated the ability to provide relevant data for the AS population, each instrument either contained some items irrelevant to individuals with AS or was missing important concepts based on the interviews. No single instrument covered all relevant domains specific to AS. Conclusion: Future work should consider the adaptation of existing COAs and the development of a novel AS-specific instrument for use in clinical research to ensure outcomes important to this patient population are captured.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patient-reported outcome measures are tools for evaluating symptoms, magnitude of limitations, baseline health status, and outcomes from the patient's perspective. Healthcare professional organizations and payers increasingly recommend PROMs for clinical care, but there lacks guidance regarding effective communication of PROMs with orthopedic surgery patients. This qualitative study aimed to identify (1) patient attitudes toward the use and communication of PROMs, and (2) what patients feel are the most relevant or important aspects of PROM results to discuss with their physicians. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a multispeciality orthopedic clinic. Three PROMs: the EuroQol-5 Dimension, the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, and the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test were shown and a semi-structured interview was conducted to elicit PROMs attitudes and preferences. Interviews were transcribed and inductive-deductively coded. Coded excerpts were aggregated to (1) identify major themes and (2) analyze how themes interacted. RESULT: Three themes emerged: (1) Beliefs toward the purpose of PROMs, (2) PROMs as a reflection of self, and (3) PROMs to facilitate communication and guide healthcare decisions. These themes informed a framework outlining the patient perspective on communicating PROMs during clinical care. CONCLUSION: Patient attitudes toward the use and communication of PROMs start with the incorporation of patient beliefs, which can facilitate or act as a barrier to engagement. Patients should ideally believe that PROMs are an accurate reflection of personal health state before incorporation into care. Clinicians should endeavor to communicate the purpose of a chosen PROM in line with a patient's unique needs and what they feel is most relevant to their own care. Aspects of PROMs results which may be helpful to address include providing context for what scores mean and how they are calculated, and using scores as a way to weigh risks and benefits of treatment and tracking progress over time. Future research can focus on the effect of communication strategies on patient outcomes and engagement in care.

AB  - Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) includes the advantages of both cognitive diagnosis (CD) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which can offer detailed diagnosis feedback for each examinee by applying fewer test items and time. It has been a promising field. An item bank is a prerequisite for the implementation of CD-CAT. However, its maintenance is a very challenging task. One of the effective ways to maintain the item bank is online calibration. Till now, there are only a few online calibration methods in the CD-CAT context that can calibrate Q-matrix and item parameters simultaneously. Moreover, the computational efficiency of these methods needs to be further improved. Therefore, it is crucial to find more online calibration methods that jointly calibrate the Q-matrix and item parameters. Inspired by the SIE (Single-Item Estimation) method proposed by Chen et al. (2015) and information gain feature selection criteria in feature selection, an information gain of entropy-based online calibration method (IGEOCM) was proposed in this study. The proposed method can jointly calibrate Q-matrix and item parameters in a sequential manner. The calibration process of the new items was described as follows: First, for the new item j, the q-vector can be calibrated by maximizing the information gain of entropy-based on the basis of the attribute patterns of examinees and the examinees<e2><80><99> responses to item j. Second, the item parameters of the new item j are estimated by the EM algorithm based on the posterior distribution of examinees<e2><80><99> attribute pattern, the examinees<e2><80><99> responses to item j, and the q-vector estimated in the first step. The first and second step are repeated for all other new items to obtain their estimated Q-matrix and item parameters item by item. Two simulation studies were conducted to examine whether the IGEOCM could accurately and efficiently calibrate the Q-matrix and item parameters of the new items under different calibration sample sizes (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200), different attribute pattern distributions (uniform distribution, higher-order distribution, and multivariate normal distribution), the different number of new items answered by examinee (4, 6, and 8), and different item selection algorithms (posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler, PWKL; the modified PWKL, MPWKL; the generalized deterministic inputs, noisy and gate model discrimination index, GDI; and Shannon entropy, SHE). Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method was compared with the SIE, SIE-R-BIC, and RMSEA-N methods. The results indicated that (1) The IGEOCM worked well in terms of the calibration accuracy and estimation efficiency under all conditions, and outperformed the SIE, SIE-R-BIC, and RMSEA-N methods overall. (2) The accuracy of the item calibration increases as the sample size increases for all calibration methods under all conditions. (3) The SIE, SIE-R-BIC, RMSEA-N, and IGEOCM performed better under the uniform distribution and higher-order distribution than under the multivariate normal distribution. (4) The number of new items answered by the examinee had a negligible impact on the calibration accuracy and computation efficiency of the SIE, SIE-R-BIC, RMSEA-N, and IGEOCM. (5) The item selection algorithm in CD-CAT affects the Q-matrix calibration accuracy of the SIE and IGEOCM methods. Under the higher-order distribution and multivariate normal distribution, the SIE method and IGEOCM had higher Q-matrix calibration accuracy when the item selection algorithms were MPWKL and GDI. On the whole, although the proposed IGEOCM is competitive and outperforms the conventional method irrespective of the calibration precision or computational efficiency, the studies on the online calibration method in CD-CAT still need to be further deepened and expanded.

PY  - 2020
PB  - Oxford University Press
CY  - NA
AB  - Introduction: Chronic pain affects U.S. service member<e2><80><99>s (SMs) more disproportionately than individuals in the general public. SMs have unique cultural pressures to ignore or deny acute pain; therefore, the beliefs and behaviors of this group may cause them to self-report their acute pain in a specific manner. This study evaluated the strength of the relationship of the patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) upper extremity computer adaptive test (CAT) and assessed U.S. active duty SMs experience of acute pain and function compared to the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (QuickDASH). In addition, the PROMIS pain interference CAT, PROMIS pain behavior CAT, and PROMIS anxiety CAT were correlated to the PROMIS upper extremity CAT and QuickDASH questionnaires. Materials and Methods: This mixed methods, sequential, explanatory study included a convenience sample of 26 participants from two occupational therapy clinics. Participants were administered five self-report questionnaires at initial evaluation and at follow up (30<e2><80><93>90 day). At follow up, 12 participants completed a semi-structured interview. Categorical variables were summarized using percentages and analyzed using a chi-square goodness of fit test. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the linear relationship between the QuickDASH and specified PROMIS questionnaires. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brooke Army Medical Center, reference number C.2017.173d. Results: The initial and follow up scores from the self-report questionnaires demonstrated a good to excellent correlation between the PROMIS upper extremity CAT and the QuickDASH (r = <e2><80><93>0.65; r = <e2><80><93>0.81; p < 0.001). Qualitative data were gathered during a semi-structured interview of 12 participants after the follow up and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Three themes emerged from qualitative analysis of data: (1) impact of military culture, (2) psychosocial effects of acute pain, and (3) therapist contributions to disability awareness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates several cultural and psychosocial influences concerning the experience of SMs with acute UE disability and pain, which were not previously reported for this population.

AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multidimensional-Method A (M-Method A) has been proposed as an efficient and effective online calibration method for multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) (Chen & Xin, Paper presented at the 78th Meeting of the Psychometric Society, Arnhem, The Netherlands, 2013). However, a key assumption of M-Method A is that it treats person parameter estimates as their true values, thus this method might yield erroneous item calibration when person parameter estimates contain non-ignorable measurement errors. To improve the performance of M-Method A, this paper proposes a new MCAT online calibration method, namely, the full functional MLE-M-Method A (FFMLE-M-Method A). This new method combines the full functional MLE (Jones & Jin in Psychometrika 59:59<e2><80><93>75, 1994; Stefanski & Carroll in Annals of Statistics 13:1335<e2><80><93>1351, 1985) with the original M-Method A in an effort to correct for the estimation error of ability vector that might otherwise adversely affect the precision of item calibration. Two correction schemes are also proposed when implementing the new method. A simulation study was conducted to show that the new method generated more accurate item parameter estimation than the original M-Method A in almost all conditions.

AB  - Background: Many cognitive tests assess a limited developmental span, making longitudinal measurement for trials aimed at improving cognition challenging. Tests targeting transitional skills, which integrate foundational abilities into complex schemas, may be amenable to assessment across a wide developmental span. Furthermore, tablet-based tests permit computer adaptive testing (CAT), which is psychometrically more efficient and could increase testing motivation, especially for children with developmental delays. Such measures may be useful for research and clinical practice. Aims: Outline the creation of a novel, tablet-based concept formation test, and evaluate its feasibility in individuals with mental ages less than 24-months. Methods and procedures: Item generation, user interface construction, and pre-piloting were conducted in consultation with subject matter experts. Item content and interface parameters underwent iterative revisions, resulting in the pilot test. Outcomes and results: We created and piloted a tablet-based test of concept formation suitable for CAT-based administration with items of increasing difficulty based on target salience. We show feasibility in individuals with mental ages less than 24-months-old. Conclusions and implications: Tablet-based assessment of concept formation may be a useful outcome measure of an aspect of cognitive ability in young children. Future work will address optimizing the user interface and developing CAT administration. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Proposed for the 11th edition of the World Health Organization<e2><80><99>s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) is a dimensional trait model for the classification of personality disorder (Tyrer, Reed, & Crawford, 2015). The ICD-11 proposal consists of 5 broad domains: negative affective, detachment, dissocial, disinhibition, and anankastic (Mulder, Horwood, Tyrer, Carter, & Joyce, 2016). Several field trials have examined this proposal, yet none has included a direct measure of the trait model. The purpose of the current study was to develop and provide initial validation for the Personality Inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD), a self-report measure of this proposed 5-domain maladaptive trait model. Item selection and scale construction proceeded through 3 initial data collections assessing potential item performance. Two subsequent studies were conducted for scale validation. In Study 1, the PiCD was evaluated in a sample of 259 MTurk participants (who were or had been receiving mental health treatment) with respect to 2 measures of general personality structure: The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire<e2><80><94>Revised and the 5-Dimensional Personality Test. In Study 2, the PiCD was evaluated in an additional sample of 285 participants with respect to 2 measures of maladaptive personality traits: The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 and the Computerized Adaptive Test for Personality Disorders. Study 3 provides an item-level exploratory structural equation model with the combined samples from Studies 1 and 2. The results are discussed with respect to the validity of the measure and the potential benefits for future research in having a direct, self-report measure of the ICD-11 trait proposal.

AB  - On the basis of 8 standards of mental health, the researchers worked out one psychological scale Self-report Inventory for Shanghai Middle School Students (SISMSS). This scale consists of three parts, i.e. adaptive testing, illness diagnostic test and validity scale. Adaptive testing including 8 branch-tests, namely, active study, steady and optimistic emotion, self-cognition, sense of duty, achievement motivation, communication ability, sex consciousness and self-control ability. Illness diagnostic test including 7 branch-tests, namely, subschizophrenia, sub-depression, mania, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, phobia and hysteria. The research results indicate that the coefficient of internal consistency of SISMSS is 0.9081 (p<0.01). In addition, coefficient of correlation with SCL-90 is 0.58 and 0.734 with MHT. The construct validity of adaptive testing is also verified by factor analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aberrant responses, which are caused by examinees' unusual behaviors (e.g., carelessness, speededness, item pre-knowledge, warm-up, copying answers from neighbors), are frequently seen in various testing programs. Having aberrant responses may bias item parameter estimates and threaten test validity. Thus proper modeling and detection of aberrant responses is crucial both theoretically and practically in educational and psychological measurement. Previous work has primarily approached the aberrant responses research in terms of developing person fit statistics and proposing models to capture the aberrant behaviors. This dissertation attempts to incorporate change-point analysis (CPA) to investigate two types of aberrant responses: speededness and warm-up effect; both of which can be viewed as having an abrupt change point. This is an extension work of Shao, Li, and Cheng (in press) which first introduced the CPA method to detect test speededness with known item parameters. Following this line of research, three studies are carried out. The first study investigates whether CPA can help improve item calibration in the presence of speededness. In this study, the CPA method is used to first detect speeded responses with unknown item parameters. After the detection of speeded examinees as well as their corresponding speeding point (the point at which an examinee starts to speed), a cleansing procedure based upon the detected speeding point is proposed to help improve item parameter estimation. The performance of speededness detection as well as the item parameter recovery before/after utilizing the cleansing procedure are evaluated. The second study applies the CPA method to warm-up effect detection. This study first compares the impact of warm-up effect on ability estimation and examinees' classification accuracy on two types of tests: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Paper and Pencil (linear) Testing. In the second step, the CPA based detection of warm-up effect is carried out. Two methods of obtaining the critical values are utilized in the study. Different from the first two studies which both conduct CPA using item response information, the third study applies CPA to response time data in speededness detection. A gradual change log-normal model is proposed to better model the real-life change of response time affected by speededness. Two test statistics are introduced to test for a change point using response time. Moreover, this study explores the possibility of using a fixed critical value across conditions at each nominal level so that practitioners do not have to obtain a critical value through simulation every time they run speededness detection. The dissertation thesis concludes with the final chapter including a discussion of the results, limitations, practical implications, and future directions.

AB  - Background Academic dishonesty (AD) and trustworthy assessment (TA) are fundamental issues in the context of an online assessment. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have explored AD and TA issues in online assessment practice. Objectives Hence, this research aimed at investigating the latest findings regarding AD forms, factors affecting AD and TA, and solutions to reduce AD and increase TA to maintain the quality of online assessment. Methods We reviewed 52 articles in Scopus and Web of Science databases from January 2017 to April 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaâ€Analyses model as a guideline to perform a systematic literature review that included three stages, namely planning, conducting, and reporting. Results and conclusions Our review found that there were different forms of AD among students in online learning namely plagiarism, cheating, collusion, and using jockeys. Individual factors such as being lazy to learn, lack of ability, and poor awareness as well as situational factors including the influence of friends, the pressure of the courses, and ease of access to information were strongly associated with AD. A technologyâ€based approach such as using plagiarismâ€checking software, multiâ€artificial intelligence (AI) in a learning management system, computer adaptive tests, and online proctoring as well as pedagogicalâ€based approaches, such as implementing a research ethics course programme, and a reâ€design assessment form such as oralâ€based and dynamic assessment to reduce cheating behaviour and also sociocultural and sociotechnical adjustment related to the online assessment are reported to reduce AD and increase TA. Implications Educators should adjust the design of online learning and assessment methods as soon as possible. The identified gaps point towards unexplored study on AI, machine learning, learning analytics tools, and related issues of AD and TA in K12 education could motivated future work in the field.

AB  - Procedures based on item response theory (IRT) are widely accepted for solving various measurement problems which cannot be solved using classical test theory (CTT) procedures. The desirable features of dichotomous IRT models over CTT are well known and have been documented by Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991). However, dichotomous IRT models are inappropriate for situations where items need to be scored in more than two categories. For example, in performance assessments, most of the scoring rubrics for performance assessment require scoring of examinee's responses in ordered categories. In addition, polytomous IRT models are useful for assessing an examinee's partial knowledge or levels of mastery. However, the successful application of polytomous IRT models to practical situations depends on the availability of reasonable and well-behaved estimates of the parameters of the models. Therefore, in this study, the behavior of estimators of parameters in polytomous IRT models were examined. In the first study, factors that affected the accuracy, variance, and bias of the marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimators in the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) were investigated. Overall, the results of the study showed that the MML estimators of the parameters of the GPCM, as obtained through the computer program, PARSCALE, performed well under various conditions. However, there was considerable bias in the estimates of the category parameters under all conditions investigated. The average bias did not decrease when sample size and test length increased. The bias contributed to large RMSE in the estimation of category parameters. Further studies need to be conducted to study the effect of bias in the estimates of parameters on the estimation of ability, the development of item banks, and on adaptive testing based on polytomous IRT models. In the second study, the effectiveness of Bayesian procedures for estimating parameters in the GPCM was examined. The results showed that Bayes procedures provided more accurate estimates of parameters with small data sets. Priors on the slope parameters, while having only a modest effect on the accuracy of estimation of slope parameters, had a very positive effect on the accuracy of estimation of the step difficulty parameters.

AB  - The popularity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is increasing rapidly. In order to make learning environments more efficient, researchers have been exploring the possibility of an automatic adaptation of the learning environment to the learner or the context. One of the possible adaptation techniques is adaptive item sequencing by matching the difficulty of the items to the learner<e2><80><99>s knowledge level. This is already accomplished to a certain extent in adaptive testing environments, where the test is tailored to the person<e2><80><99>s ability level by means of the item response theory (IRT). Even though IRT has been a prevalent computerized adaptive test (CAT) approach for decades and applying IRT in item-based ITSs could lead to similar advantages as in CAT (e.g. higher motivation and more efficient learning), research on the application of IRT in such learning environments is highly restricted or absent. The purpose of this paper was to explore the feasibility of applying IRT in adaptive item-based ITSs. Therefore, we discussed the two main challenges associated with IRT application in such learning environments: the challenge of the data set and the challenge of the algorithm. We concluded that applying IRT seems to be a viable solution for adaptive item selection in item-based ITSs provided that some modifications are implemented. Further research should shed more light on the adequacy of the proposed solutions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Assessments for spatial working memory (SWM) in pet dogs that can detect age-related cognitive deficits in a single session may aid in diagnosing canine dementia and may facilitate translational research on Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease in humans. Adaptive testing procedures are widely used in single-session assessments for humans with diverse cognitive abilities. In this study, we designed and deployed two up-down staircase assessments for SWM in which 26 pet dogs were required to recall the location of a treat hidden behind one of two identical boxes following delays of variable length. In the first experiment, performance tended to decline with age but few dogs completed the test (n = 10). However, all of the dogs that participated in the second experiment (n = 24) completed the assessment and provided reliable evidence of learning and retaining the task. Delay length and age significantly predicted performance supporting the validity of this assessment. The relationships between age and performance were described by inverted U-shaped functions as both old and young dogs displayed deficits in weighted cumulative-scores and trial-by-trial performance. Thus, SWM in pet dogs may develop until midlife and decline thereafter. Exploratory analyses of non-mnemonic fixation strategies, sustained engagement, inhibitory control, and potential improvements for future SWM assessments which adopt this paradigm are also discussed.

AB  - To test whether allaying the anxiety of older Ss in taking intelligence tests significantly raises scores, 30 Ss matched for age, education, and IQ were retested by the WAIS: <c2><bd> by conventional methods and <c2><bd> by the 'adaptive' method. This technique involved beginning each test with an item below the S's anticipated mental level and alternating easy and hard items from the scale or a pool of similar items. The increase in scores from using the adaptive method was significantly greater than increase from retesting by the consecutive method. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

The 225 Ss were randomly assigned to 3 test difficulty conditions and given a variable length computer adaptive test. Examinees in the hard, medium, and easy test condition took a test targeted at the 50%, 60%, or 70% probability of correct response. The results show that altering the probability of a correct response does not affect estimation of examinee ability and that taking an easier computer adaptive test only slightly increases the number of items necessary to reach specified levels of precision.

AB  - With the rapid growth of computer and mobile technology, it is a challenge to integrate computer based test (CBT) with mobile learning (m-learning) especially for formative assessment and self-assessment. In terms of self-assessment, computer adaptive test (CAT) is a proper way to enable students to evaluate themselves. In CAT, students are assessed through a process that uses item response theory (IRT), a well-founded psychometric theory. Furthermore, a large item bank is indispensable to a test, but when a CAT system has a large item bank, the test item selection of IRT becomes more tedious. Besides the large item bank, item exposure mechanism is also essential to a testing system. However, IRT all lack the above-mentioned points. These reasons have motivated the authors to carry out this study. This paper describes a design issue aimed at the development and implementation of an adaptive testing system. The system can support several assessment functions and different devices. Moreover, the researchers apply a novel approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO) to alleviate the computational complexity and resolve the problem of item exposure. Throughout the development of the system, a formative evaluation was embedded into an integral part of the design methodology that was used for improving the system. After the system was formally released onto the web, some questionnaires and experiments were conducted to evaluate the usability, precision, and efficiency of the system. The results of these evaluations indicated that the system provides an adaptive testing for different devices and supports versatile assessment functions. Moreover, the system can estimate students' ability reliably and validly and conduct an adaptive test efficiently. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the system was alleviated by the PSO approach. By the approach, the test item selection procedure becomes efficient and the average best fitness values are very close to the optimal solutions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve measurement precision, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is developing an item bank for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of emotional functioning (EF). The item bank will be within the conceptual framework of the widely used EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ-C30). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: On the basis of literature search and evaluations by international samples of experts and cancer patients, 38 candidate items were developed. The psychometric properties of the items were evaluated in a large international sample of cancer patients. This included evaluations of dimensionality, item response theory (IRT) model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), and of measurement precision/statistical power. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 1,023 cancer patients from four countries. The evaluations showed that 24 items could be included in a unidimensional IRT model. DIF did not seem to have any significant impact on the estimation of EF. Evaluations indicated that the CAT measure may reduce sample size requirements by up to 50% compared to the QLQ-C30 EF scale without reducing power. CONCLUSION: On the basis of thorough psychometric evaluations, we have established an EF item bank of 24 items. This will allow for more precise and flexible measurement of EF, while maintaining backward compatibility with the QLQ-C30 EF scale.

AB  - IRT, also referred as 'modern test theory', offers many advantages over CTT-based methods in test development. Specifically, an IRT information function has the capability to build a test that has the desired precision of measurement for any defined proficiency scale when a sufficient number of test items are available. This feature is extremely useful when the information is used for decision making, for instance, whether an examinee attain certain mastery level. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is one of the many examples using IRT information functions in test construction. The purposes of this study were as follows: (1) to examine the consequences of improving the test quality through the addition of more discriminating items with different item formats; (2) to examine the effect of having a test where its difficulty does not align with the ability level of the intended population; (3) to investigate the change in decision consistency and decision accuracy; and (4) to understand changes in expected information when test quality is either improved or degraded, using both empirical and simulated data. Main findings from the study were as follows: (1) increasing the discriminating power of any types of items generally increased the level of information; however, sometimes it could bring adverse effect to the extreme ends of the ability continuum; (2) it was important to have more items that were targeted at the population of interest, otherwise, no matter how good the quality of the items may be, they were of less value in test development when they were not targeted to the distribution of candidate ability or at the cutscores; (3) decision consistency (DC), Kappa statistic, and decision accuracy (DA) increased with better quality items; (4) DC and Kappa were negatively affected when difficulty of the test did not match with the ability of the intended population; however, the effect was less severe if the test was easier than needed; (5) tests with more better quality items lowered false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rate at the cutscores; (6) when test difficulty did not match with the ability of the target examinees, in general, both FP and FN rates increased; (7) polytomous items tended to yield more information than dichotomously scored items, regardless of the discriminating parameter and difficulty of the item; and (8) the more score categories an item had, the more information it could provide. Findings from this thesis should help testing agencies and practitioners to have better understanding of the item parameters on item and test information functions. This understanding is crucial for the improvement of the item bank quality and ultimately on how to build better tests that could provide more accurate proficiency classifications. However, at the same time, item writers should be conscientious about the fact that the item information function is merely a statistical tool for building a good test, other criteria should also be considered, for example, content balancing and content validity.

AB  - Background: Suicide risk assessments are often challenging for clinicians, and therefore, biological markers are warranted as guiding tools in these assessments. Suicidal patients display increased cytokine levels in peripheral blood, although the composite inflammatory profile in the subjects is still unknown. It is also not yet established whether certain inflammatory changes are specific to suicidal subjects. To address this, we measured 45 immunobiological factors in peripheral blood and identified the biological profiles associated with cross-diagnostic suicide risk and depression, respectively. Methods: Sixty-six women with mood and anxiety disorders underwent computerized adaptive testing for mental health, assessing depression and suicide risk. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to uncover system level associations between suicide risk, depression, and the immunobiological factors in plasma. Secondary regression models were used to establish the sensitivity of the results to potential confounders, including age, body mass index (BMI), treatment and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The biological profile of patients assessed to be at increased suicide risk differed from that associated with depression. At the system level, a biological cluster containing increased levels of interleukin-6, lymphocytes, monocytes, white blood cell count and polymorphonuclear leukocyte count significantly impacted suicide risk, with the latter two inferring the strongest influence. The cytokine interleukin-8 was independently and negatively associated with increased suicide risk. The results remained after adjusting for confounders. Limitations: This study is cross-sectional and not designed to prove causality. Discussion: A unique immunobiological profile was linked to increased suicide risk. The profile was different from that observed in patients with depressive symptoms, and indicates that granulocyte mediated biological mechanisms could be activated in patients at risk for suicide.

No statistically significant differences were found among the test types for either estimated ability or posttest anxiety. Statistically significant differences were found for the number of correct responses and testing time. The results suggest caution in generalizations made by researchers and practitioners regarding the effects of a SAT on examinees. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The a-stratification procedure of item exposure control was designed to stratify items by item discrimination to ensure that an adaptive test would administer items from the entire range of items, not just the most-informative ones. An improvement to the a-stratification method, the a-stratification with b-blocking procedure added stratification according to item difficulty in order to take into account any correlation that might exist within the item pool between item discrimination and item difficulty. These procedures have been shown to work well using dichotomous items. This dissertation explored both stratification procedures using polytomous item pools to investigate whether or not an optimum number of strata could be implemented when administering polytomous computerized adaptive tests. In addition to the stratification procedures, two other exposure control conditions were studied. The randomesque procedure was used in one condition while a no exposure control condition served as a baseline condition. Items calibrated according to the generalized partial credit model were used to construct two item pools. Since the items covered three areas of science, content balancing procedures were incorporated to ensure that each adaptive test provided the appropriate balance of content. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate ability levels from simulated CATs. The number of strata used with both stratification procedures ranged from two to five, to ensure enough items per stratum. Along with descriptive statistics and correlations, bias and root mean squared error helped portray the accuracy of the simulated tests. Item exposure and item pool usage rates were used to show how much of the item pools were being used across administrations of the tests. Finally, item overlap rates were calculated to show how many of the same items were being used among simulated examinees of similar and different abilities. The results of this study did not reveal an optimum number of strata for the stratification procedures with either item pool. Furthermore, the randomesque procedure outperformed the stratification procedures in terms of item exposure and item overlap rates for both item pools. This surprising result was not affected by the number of strata used within the stratification procedures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

CY  - NA
AB  - The computer-adaptive multistage testing (ca-MST) has been developed as an alternative to computerized adaptive testing (CAT), and been increasingly adopted in large-scale assessments. Current research and practice only focus on ca-MST panels for credentialing purposes. The ca-MST test mode, therefore, is designed to gauge a single scale. The present study is the first step to investigate ca-MST panels for diagnostic purposes, which involve the assessment of multiple attributes in the same test. This study employed computer simulation to compare multidimensional ca-MST panels and their unidimensional counterparts, and to explore the factors that affect the accuracy and efficiency of multidimensional ca-MST. Nine multidimensional ca-MST panel designs<e2><80><94>which differed in configuration and test length<e2><80><94>were simulated under varied attribute correlation scenarios. In addition, item pools with different qualities were studied to suggest appropriate item bank design. The comparison between the multidimensional ca-MST and a sequential of unidimensional ca-MST suggested that when attributes correlated moderate to high, employing a multidimensional ca-MST provided more accurate and efficient scoring decisions than several unidimensional ca-MST with IRT scoring. However, a multidimensional ca-MST did not perform better than its unidimensional counterpart with MIRT scoring. Nevertheless, multidimensional panels are still promising for diagnostic purposes given practical considerations. The investigation on multidimensional ca-MST design indicated the following: Higher attribute correlation was associated with better scoring decision because more information carried by a correlation matrix was available for estimation. This held true across all item pool conditions. An optimal item pool would be the one that was discriminative, appropriately located and specifically designed for a configuration. The accuracy and efficiency of a multidimensional ca-MST panel would be diminished if its item pool was too easy, or not informative. According to the results, the 1-2-3 configuration design was most promising. In terms of test length, an appropriate decision would largely depend on the attribute correlation and the item pool characteristics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) aims to develop self-reported item banks for clinical research. The PROMIS pediatrics (aged 8<e2><80><93>17) project focuses on the development of item banks across several health domains (physical function, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, social role relationships, and asthma symptoms). The psychometric properties of the anxiety and depressive symptom item banks are described. Methods: Participants (n = 1,529) were recruited in public school settings, hospital-based outpatient and subspecialty pediatrics clinics. The anxiety (k = 18) and depressive symptoms (k = 21) items were split between two test administration forms. Hierarchical confirmatory factor-analytic models (CFA) were conducted to evaluate scale dimensionality and local dependence. IRT analyses were then used to finalize item banks and short forms. Results: CFA results confirmed that anxiety and depressive symptoms are separate constructs and indicative of negative affect. Items with local dependence and DIF were removed resulting in 15 anxiety and 14 depressive symptoms items. The psychometric differences between short forms and simulated computer adaptive tests are presented. Conclusions: PROMIS pediatric item banks were developed to provide efficient assessment of health-related quality of life domains. This sample provides initial calibrations of anxiety and depressive symptoms item banks and creates PROMIS pediatric instruments, version 1.0.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored the performance of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety assessment relative to the Depression assessment in orthopedic patients, the relationship between Anxiety with self-reported Physical Function and Pain Interference, and to determine if Anxiety levels varied according to the location of orthopedic conditions. Methods: This cross-sectional evaluation analyzed 14,962 consecutive adult new-patient visits to a tertiary orthopedic practice between 4/1/2016 and 12/31/2016. All patients completed PROMIS Anxiety, Depression, Physical Function, and Pain Interference computer adaptive tests (CATs) as routine clinical intake. Patients were grouped by the orthopedic service providing care and categorized as either affected with Anxiety if scoring > 62 based on linkage to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 survey. Spearman correlations between the PROMIS scores were calculated. Bivariate statistics assessed differences in Anxiety and Depression scores between patients of different orthopedic services. Results: 20% of patients scored above the threshold to be considered affected by Anxiety. PROMIS Anxiety scores demonstrated a stronger correlation than Depression scores with Physical Function and Pain Interference scores. Patients with spine conditions reported the highest median Anxiety scores and were more likely to exceed the Anxiety threshold than patients presenting to sports or upper extremity surgeons. Conclusions: One in five new orthopedic patients reports Anxiety levels that may warrant intervention. This rate is heightened in patients needing spine care. Patient-reported Physical Function more strongly correlates with PROMIS Anxiety than Depression suggesting that the Anxiety CAT is a valuable addition to assess mental health among orthopedic patients. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic level III. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: With the increasingly rapid growth of the elderly population, individuals aged 65 years and above now compose 14% of Taiwanese citizens, thereby making Taiwanese society an aged society. A leading factor that affects the elderly population is dementia. A method of precisely and efficiently examining patients with dementia through multidimensional computer adaptive testing (MCAT) to accurately determine the patients<e2><80><99> stage of dementia needs to be developed. This study aimed to develop online MCAT that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, or smartphones to predict the extent of dementia for patients responding to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) instrument. Methods: The CDR was applied to 366 outpatients in a hospital in Taiwan. MCAT was employed with parameters for items across eight dimensions, and responses were simulated to compare the efficiency and precision between MCAT and non-adaptive testing (NAT). The number of items saved and the estimated person measures was compared between the results of MCAT and NAT, respectively. Results: MCAT yielded substantially more precise measurements and was considerably more efficient than NAT. MCAT achieved 20.19% (= [53 <e2><88><92> 42.3]/53) saving in item length when the measurement differences were less than 5%. Pearson correlation coefficients were highly consistent among the eight domains. The cut-off points for the overall measures were <e2><88><92> 1.4, <e2><88><92> 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 logits, which was equivalent to 20% for each portion in percentile scores. Substantially fewer items were answered through MCAT than through NAT without compromising the precision of MCAT. Conclusions: Developing a website that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, and smartphones to help them perform online screening and prediction of dementia in older adults is useful and manageable.

AB  - This book presents the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in test development. In particular, it includes research and successful examples of using AI technology in automated item generation, automated test assembly, automated scoring, and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). By utilizing artificial intelligence, the efficiency of item development, test form construction, test delivery, and scoring could be dramatically increased. Chapters on automated item generation offer different perspectives related to generating a large number of items with controlled psychometric properties including the latest development of using machine learning methods. The book illustrates automated scoring for different types of assessments such as speaking and writing from both methodological aspects and practical considerations. Further, it elaborates automated test assembly for the conventional linear tests from both classical test theory and item response theory perspectives. Item pool design and assembly for the linear-on-the-fly tests elaborates more complications in practice when test security is a big concern. Finally, several chapters focus on CAT at either item or module levels. CAT is further illustrated as an effective approach to increasing test-takers' engagement in testing. In summary, the book includes both theoretical, methodological, and applied research and practices that serve as the foundation for future development. These chapters provide illustrations of efforts to automate the process of test development. While some of these automation processes have become common practices such as automated test assembly, automated scoring, and computerized adaptive testing, some others such as automated item generation calls for more research and exploration. When new AI methods are emerging and evolving, it is expected that researchers can expand and improve the methods for automating different steps in test development to enhance the automation features and practitioners can adopt quality automation procedures to improve assessment practices.

AB  - Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) based on the bifactor model is suitable for tests with multidimensional bifactor measurement structures. Several item selection methods that proved to be more advantageous than the maximum Fisher information method are not practical for bifactor MCAT due to time-consuming computations resulting from high dimensionality. To make them applicable in bifactor MCAT, dimension reduction is applied to four item selection methods, which are the posterior-weighted Fisher D-optimality (PDO) and three non-Fisher information-based methods<e2><80><94>posterior expected Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler information (PKL), continuous entropy (CE), and mutual information (MI). They were compared with the Bayesian D-optimality (BDO) method in terms of estimation precision. When both the general and group factors are the measurement objectives, BDO, PDO, CE, and MI perform equally well and better than PKL. When the group factors represent nuisance dimensions, MI and CE perform the best in estimating the general factor, followed by the BDO, PDO, and PKL. How the bifactor pattern and test length affect estimation accuracy was also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) is a National Institutes of Health initiative to develop item banks measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and to create and make available a computerized adaptive testing system (CAT) that allows for efficient and precise assessment of PROs in clinical research and practice. Aims of the Study: This paper provides an overview of PROMIS and its application to mental health research. Methods: The PROMIS methodology for item bank development and testing is described, with a focus on the implications of this work for mental health research. Results: Utilizing qualitative item review and state-of-the-art applications of item response theory (IRT), PROMIS investigators have developed, tested, and released item banks measuring physical, mental, and social health components. Ongoing efforts continue to add new item banks and further validate existing banks. Discussion: PROMIS provides item banks measuring several domains of interest to mental health researchers including emotional distress, social function, and sleep. PROMIS methodology also provides a rigorous standard for the development of new mental health measures. Implications for Health Care Provision: Web-based CAT or administration of short forms derived from PROMIS item banks provide efficient and precise dimensional estimates of clinical outcomes that can be utilized to monitor patient progress and assess quality improvement. Implications for Future Research: Use of the dimensional PROMIS metrics (and co-calibration of the PROMIS item banks with existing PROs) will allow comparisons of mental health and related health outcomes across disorders and studies.

AB  - Objectives: The Patientâ€Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Health Organization has compiled and calibrated item banks for various domains in the United States, and these item banks have been translated into Dutch language. Methods: The item banks for Anxiety and Depression have been administered in two samples, one drawn from the Dutch general and one drawn from the Dutch clinical population. The aim of this study was to investigate the appropriateness of the official PROMIS item parameters for these item banks that have been estimated based on data collected in the United States for use in the Netherlands. For both domains, we determined the fit of U.S. item parameters, the effect on individual domain scores and levels, the effect on correlations with full item bank totals, and the effect on classification accuracies of adaptive test scores for diagnoses of anxiety and mood disorders. Results: The results showed that especially in the clinical population sample, fit appeared to be problematic for many items. However, simulations revealed that both sets of item parameters (official PROMIS vs. unique Dutch) perform nearly equally well in practice. Conclusion: We tentatively conclude that the official PROMIS item parameters can be used for scaling respondents in the Netherlands. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Adaptive tests are more efficient than fixedâ€length tests through the use of item response theory; adaptive tests also present students questions that are tailored to their proficiency level. Although the adaptive algorithm is straightforward, developing a multidimensional computer adaptive test (MCAT) measure is complex. Evidenceâ€centered design (ECD) can provide a highly structured framework to guide the development of a MCAT. In this paper, the development of the adaptive reading motivation measure (ARMM) demonstrates the process of applying ECD to the development of a MCAT measure. This paper focuses on the conceptual assessment framework layer of the ECD that guides the technical aspects of MCAT development. The five models of conceptual assessment framework layer are student model, task model, evidence model, assembly model, and presentation model. How each model guided the development of the ARMM is described in detail. In this paper, we demonstrate how the conceptual assessment framework in ECD can provide a useful structure for developing MCAT measures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: We review the papers presented at the NCI/DIA conference, to identify areas of controversy and uncertainty, and to highlight those aspects of item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) that require theoretical or empirical research in order to justify their application to patient reported outcomes (PROs). Background: IRT and CAT offer exciting potential for the development of a new generation of PRO instruments. However, most of the research into these techniques has been in non-healthcare settings, notably in education. Educational tests are very different from PRO instruments, and consequently problematic issues arise when adapting IRT and CAT to healthcare research. Results: Clinical scales differ appreciably from educational tests, and symptoms have characteristics distinctly different from examination questions. This affects the transferring of IRT technology. Particular areas of concern when applying IRT to PROs include inadequate software, difficulties in selecting models and communicating results, insufficient testing of local independence and other assumptions, and a need of guidelines for estimating sample size requirements. Similar concerns apply to differential item functioning (DIF), which is an important application of IRT. Multidimensional IRT is likely to be advantageous only for closely related PRO dimensions. Conclusions: Although IRT and CAT provide appreciable potential benefits, there is a need for circumspection. Not all PRO scales are necessarily appropriate targets for this methodology. Traditional psychometric methods, and especially qualitative methods, continue to have an important role alongside IRT. Research should be funded to address the specific concerns that have been identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent developments in the dimensional assessment of personality functioning have made the implementation of latent measurement models increasingly attractive. In this study, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a well-established personality functioning instrument (the OPD Structure Questionnaire) to identify a unidimensional latent trait and to evaluate the feasibility of computer adaptive testing (CAT). We hypothesized that the use of IRT could reduce the test burden<e2><80><94>compared to a fixed short form<e2><80><94>while maintaining high precision over a wide range of the latent trait. The OPD-SQ was collected from 1235 patients in a psychosomatic clinic. IRT assumptions were fulfilled. A 9-factor model yielded sufficient fit and unidimensionality in exploratory factor analysis with bifactor rotation. Items were iteratively reduced, and a graded-response IRT model was fitted to the data. Simulations showed that a CAT with approximately 7 items was able to capture an OPD-SQ global severity score with an accuracy similar to that of a fixed 12-item short form. The final item bank and CAT yielded satisfactory content validity. Strong correlations with depression and anxiety replicated previous results on the OPD-SQ. We concluded that IRT applications could be useful to reduce the test burden of personality functioning instruments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this text is to help current and future workers in the helping professions become better consumers of psychological and educational tests and assessment procedures. The book focuses on seven components. [1] 'Models for test use and selection.' The first chapter presents several models to provide a framework for conceptualizing when to use tests and why. [2] 'Basic competencies needed.' Chapters 2 through 5 identify the basic measurement, statistical, and research skills needed to select, administer, and interpret tests and assessment information. [3] 'Types of tests and assessment procedures.' Chapters 6 through 11 introduce the different types of test and assessment techniques that are commonly used in the helping professions. [4] 'Test takers and their needs.' Chapters 12 through 15 concern test takers and their needs. These chapters address text anxiety, test-taking skills, assessment of individuals with special needs, and computer-assisted and computer-adaptive testing. [5] 'Test administrators and their roles.' Chapters 16 through 19 look at the roles and problems of the test administrator. The validity and reliability of test results depend in part upon the skill of the examiner, who must not only administer and score the test but also interpret and disseminate the results. [6] 'Test utilization in different settings.' Chapters 20 to 22 look at how tests and assessment procedures are used in different contexts, specifically education, industry and mental health. [7] 'Current issues and trends.' The last chapter recapitulates some of the major trends and issues introduced in the text and predicts some future directions.

AB  - Comments on an article by Robert D. Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2008-17448-005[/rid]). Gibbons and colleagues' article highlights an emerging methodology of considerable value to psychiatric services. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has multiple advantages over standard paper-and-pencil assessment tools. CAT uses existing data to streamline and individualize the measurement process. By selecting items of particular relevance to an individual respondent, CAT applications simultaneously reduce the number of needed questions, increase measurement precision, and decrease respondent burden. CAT's applicability has been demonstrated, but its full potential for psychiatric services has yet to be realized. Unfortunately, the technology and infrastructure needed to implement CAT are currently beyond the reach of most clinicians and researchers.

AB  - Objective: Caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently experience anxiety related to the caregiver role. Often this is due to a caregiver<e2><80><99>s perceived need to avoid people and situations that might upset or 'trigger' the care recipient. There are currently no self-report measures that capture these feelings; thus, this article describes the development and preliminary validation efforts for the TBI-Caregiver Quality of Life (CareQOL) Caregiver Vigilance item bank. Design: A sample of 532 caregivers of civilians (n = 218) or service members/veterans (SMVs; n = 314) with TBI completed 32 caregiver vigilance items, other measures of health-related quality of life (RAND-12, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression, PROMIS Social Isolation, Caregiver Appraisal Scale), and the Mayo<e2><80><93>Portland Adaptability Inventory-4. Results: The final item bank contains 18 items, as supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory graded response modeling (GRM), and differential item functioning investigations. Expert review and GRM calibration data informed the selection of a 6-item short form and programming of a computer adaptive test. Internal consistency reliability for the different administration formats were excellent (reliability coefficients <e2><89><a5> .90). Three-week test<e2><80><93>retest stability was supported (i.e., r <e2><89><a5> .78). Correlations between vigilance and other self-report measures supported convergent and discriminant validity (0.01 <e2><89><a4> r <e2><89><a4> .69). Known-groups validity was also supported. Conclusions: The new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Vigilance computer adaptive test and corresponding 6-item short form were developed using established rigorous measurement development standards, providing the first self-report measure to evaluate caregiver vigilance. This development work indicates that this measure exhibits strong psychometric properties. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We report on the selection of self-report measures for inclusion in the NIH Toolbox that are suitable for assessing the full range of negative affect including sadness, fear, and anger. The Toolbox is intended to serve as a 'core battery' of assessment tools for cognition, sensation, motor function, and emotional health that will help to overcome the lack of consistency in measures used across epidemiological, observational, and intervention studies. A secondary goal of the NIH Toolbox is the identification of measures that are flexible, efficient, and precise, an agenda best fulfilled by the use of item banks calibrated with models from item response theory (IRT) and suitable for adaptive testing. Results from a sample of 1763 respondents supported use of the adult and pediatric item banks for emotional distress from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) as a starting point for capturing the full range of negative affect in healthy individuals. Content coverage for the adult Toolbox was also enhanced by the development of a scale for somatic arousal using items from the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) and scales for hostility and physical aggression using items from the Buss<e2><80><93>Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ).

AB  - The speech materials themselves can have a large effect on intelligibility. The lexical status of the words, the grammatical complexity of the utterances, and the length of the utterances all affect intelligibility. The characteristics of the materials when they are spoken can also affect intelligibility. These characteristics include the phonetic similarity of the words, the speaking rate and clarity of the speaker, the naturalness of the speaker's voice, the speaker's gender, and the speaker's dialect. The spectral and temporal energetic properties of non-speech maskers can have a large effect on intelligibility. If the masker is other speech, these energetic properties, as well as the informational properties of the masker, also come into play. A solution to the problems is found in the use of a different stationary masking noise for each language. The spectrum of this masker is matched to the long term average spectrum (LTAS) of the talker's voice for each language. The reflection of sound from the surfaces of an enclosed space, or reverberation, can produce measurable degradation of speech intelligibility in noise via two mechanisms. Acoustic effects of the test environment on sound field HINT scores are most problematic when an individual's scores are to be placed on the absolute scale of speech intelligibility by reference to the norms for the relevant test condition. One of the major advantages of adaptive tests is that they can measure an attribute of interest over a range that includes both normal and impaired function. In the following short reports, relevant details about the development and normalization of the HINT materials in each language are provided.

AB  - A new type of self-adapted test (S-AT), called Assisted Self-Adapted Test (AS-AT), is presented. It differs from an ordinary S-AT in that prior to selecting the difficulty category, the computer advises examinees on their best difficulty category choice, based on their previous performance. Three tests (computerized adaptive test, AS-AT, and S-AT) were compared regarding both their psychometric (precision and efficiency) and psychological (anxiety) characteristics. Tests were applied in an actual assessment situation, in which test scores determined 20% of term grades. A sample of 173 high school students participated. Neither differences in posttest anxiety nor ability were obtained. Concerning precision, AS-AT was as precise as CAT, and both revealed more precision than S-AT. It was concluded that AS-AT acted as a CAT concerning precision. Some hints, but not conclusive support, of the psychological similarity between AS-AT and S-AT was also found.

The figures in this article were reproduced from copies instead of from the originals, and although all figures were affected to some degree, Figure 1 as printed may be misleading. A reprint of Figure 1 from the original is presented. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in PA, Vol 80:12194.) Determined the auditory filtering capabilities of 4 normal listeners between 125 Hz and 1 kHz, with particular emphasis on changes of bandwidth level. Masked thresholds were determined for 4 probe frequencies at 4 levels of masking noise, each combination of probe frequency and masker level being tested at 5 notch widths. Thresholds were determined using a 2-down, 1-up adaptive testing procedure and a 2-interval, 2-alternative forced-choice task. Auditory filter bandwidths always decreased with decreasing frequency and generally increased with increasing level, although the size of the effect was not uniform across frequency. In general, the effect of level increased with frequency, with little or no effect on bandwidths at 125 Hz.<e2><80><a6> (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since test scores are typically used to differentiate among persons, one highly desirable property of a test is that it measures equally well at all levels of a trait. The present study used simulated data and a Monte Carlo technique to investigate score bias and information characteristics of R. J. Owen's (1969) Bayesian adaptive testing strategy and to examine possible causes of test bias. Factors investigated included effects of an accurate prior <ce><b8> estimate, of item discriminations, and of fixed vs variable test length. Results indicate that estimates from Owen's method are affected by the prior <ce><b8> estimate used and that the method does not provide measurements that are unbiased and equiprecise unless an accurate prior <ce><b8> estimate is used.

CY  - NA
AB  - Background: Better understanding of acute stress responses is important for revision of DSM-5. However, the latent structure and relationship between different aspects of acute stress responses haven<e2><80><99>t been clarified comprehensively. Bifactor item response model may help resolve this problem. Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop a statistical model of acute stress responses, based on data from earthquake rescuers using Acute Stress Response Scale (ASRS). Through this model, we could better understand acute stress responses comprehensively, and provide preliminary information for computerized adaptive testing of stress responses. Methods: Acute stress responses of earthquake rescuers were evaluated using ASRS, and state/trait anxiety were assessed using State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). A hierarchical item response model (bifactor model) was used to analyze the data. Additionally, we tested this hierarchical model with model fit comparisons with one-dimensional and five-dimensional models. The correlations among acute stress responses and state/trait anxiety were compared, based on both the five-dimensional and bifactor models. Results: Model fit comparisons showed bifactor model fit the data best. Item loadings on general and specific factors varied greatly between different aspects of stress responses. Many symptoms (40%) of physiological responses had positive loadings on general factor, and negative loadings on specific factor of physiological responses, while other stress responses had positive loadings on both general and specific factors. After extracting general factor of stress responses using bifactor analysis, significant positive correlations between physiological responses and state/trait anxiety (r = 0.185/0.112, p < 0.01) changed into negative ones (r = <e2><88><92>0.177/<e2><88><92>0.38, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Our results demonstrated bifactor structure of acute stress responses, and positive and negative correlations between physiological responses and stress responses suggested physiological responses could have negative feedback on severity of stress responses. This finding has not been convincingly demonstrated in previous research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Current health literacy measures are too long, imprecise, or have questionable equivalence of English and Spanish versions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and pilot testing of a new bilingual computer-based health literacy assessment tool. Methods: We analyzed literacy data from three large studies. Using a working definition of health literacy, we developed new prose, document and quantitative items in English and Spanish. Items were pilot tested on 97 English- and 134 Spanish-speaking participants to assess item difficulty. Results: Items covered topics relevant to primary care patients and providers. English- and Spanish-speaking participants understood the tasks involved in answering each type of question. The English Talking Touchscreen was easy to use and the English and Spanish items provided good coverage of the difficulty continuum. Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative results provided useful information on computer acceptability and initial item difficulty. After the items have been administered on the Talking Touchscreen (la Pantalla Parlanchina) to 600 English-speaking (and 600 Spanish-speaking) primary care patients, we will develop a computer adaptive test. Practice implications: This health literacy tool will enable clinicians and researchers to more precisely determine the level at which low health literacy adversely affects health and healthcare utilization.

AB  - Although knee and hip replacements are intended to relieve pain and improve function, up to 44% of knee replacement patients and 27% of hip replacement patients report persistent postoperative joint pain. Improving surgical pain management is essential. We conducted a single-site, 3-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted at an orthopedic clinic, among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) of the hip or knee. Mindfulness meditation (MM), hypnotic suggestion (HS), and cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation) were each delivered in a single, 15-minute group session as part of a 2-hour, preoperative education program. Preoperative outcomes-pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, pain medication desire, and anxiety-were measured with numeric rating scales. Postoperative physical functioning at 6-week follow-up was assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function computer adaptive test. Total joint arthroplasty patients were randomized to preoperative MM, HS, or cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (n = 285). Mindfulness meditation and HS led to significantly less preoperative pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and anxiety. Mindfulness meditation also decreased preoperative pain medication desire relative to cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation and increased postoperative physical functioning at 6-week follow-up relative to HS and cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation. Moderation analysis revealed the surgery type did not differentially impact the 3 interventions. Thus, a single session of a simple, scripted MM intervention may be able to immediately decrease TJA patients' preoperative clinical symptomology and improve postoperative physical function. As such, embedding brief MM interventions in surgical care pathways has the potential to improve surgical outcomes for the millions of patients receiving TJA each year.

AB  - Objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease with functional decline leading to disability. Dyspnea, the prominent symptom, can be measured using existing measures, but a lack of consensus about standardization of dyspnea measurement remains. We examined the psychometric performance of two item-response theory<e2><80><93> based (IRT) measures of dyspnea and related functional limitations (FLs) in patients with COPD and simulated computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of the banks to determine the number of questions required to achieve high precision. Methods: A total of 102 patients completed banks measuring dyspnea and FLs (33 items), from which the 10-item dyspnea and FL short forms were scored as well as other self-report measures of respiratory and physical function and emotional distress. A subset of patients completed the banks 7 to 10 days later. Pulmonary function test results were obtained from medical charts. Results: The 33-item banks and 10-item short forms had excellent internal consistency (alphas > 0.9) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.89). Patients sorted by severity level on the Medical Research Council scale were differentiated by item banks (P < 0.001) and the short forms (P < 0.01). The banks and short forms were also associated with related measures of dyspnea (e.g., Baseline Dyspnea Index, r = 0.47<e2><80><93>0.53), physical function (e.g., 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, r = <e2><88><92>0.83 to <e2><88><92>0.86) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = <e2><88><92>0.32 to <e2><88><92>0.35). On average, CAT required 4 and 5 items for accurate measurement of dyspnea and FLs, respectively. Conclusion: The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy<e2><80><93>Dyspnea short forms and banks provide options for brief, psychometrically sound measures of dyspnea and/or FLs in COPD.

AB  - Background: Supportive oncology practice can be enhanced by the integration of a brief and validated electronic patientâ€reported outcome assessment into the electronic health record (EHR) and clinical workflow. Methods: Six hundred thirtyâ€six women receiving gynecologic oncology outpatient care received instructions to complete clinical assessments through Epic MyChart, an EHR patient communication portal. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) were administered to assess fatigue, pain interference, physical function, depression, and anxiety. Checklists identified psychosocial concerns, informational and nutritional needs, and risk factors for inadequate nutrition. Assessment results, including PROMIS T scores with documented severity thresholds, were immediately populated in the EHR. Clinicians were notified of clinically elevated symptoms through EHR messages. EHR integration was designed to provide automated triage to social work providers for psychosocial concerns, to health educators for information, and to dietitians for nutritionâ€related concerns. Results: Four thousand fortyâ€two MyChart messages sent, and 3203 (79%) were reviewed by patients. The assessment was started by 1493 patients (37%), and once they started, 93% (1386 patients) completed the assessment. According to first assessments only, 49.8% of the patients who reviewed the MyChart message completed the assessment. Mean PROMIS CAT T scores indicated a lower level of physical function and elevated anxiety in comparison with the general population. Fatigue, pain, and depression scores were comparable to those of the general population. Impaired physical functioning was the most common basis for clinical alerts and occurred in 4% of the patients. Conclusions: PROMIS CATs were used to measure common cancer symptoms in routine oncology outpatient care. Immediate EHR integration facilitated the use of symptom reporting as the basis for referral to psychosocial and supportive care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test. Design: This is a psychometric study. Setting: The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany. Subjects: A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study. Interventions: Not applicable. Main measures: The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients. Results: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item<e2><80><93>trait interaction (<cf><87><c2><b2>(203) = 172.59; P = .94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits). Conclusion: The unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

TI  - Career decision self-efficacy item bank: A simulation study
JO  - Curr Psychol
VL  - NA

PB  - Springer
CY  - NA
AB  - The transformation of the current world of work, determined by technological advances, affects and challenges the career decision-making process. To face these changes, the career self-management model, derived from social cognitive career theory, offers an optimal framework that allows studying the career adaptive behaviors that favor the preparation for career decision-making. In order to obtain a measure for the core construct, career decision-making self-efficacy, we elaborated an item bank from the selection of reagents from two scales widely used in the field for its estimation. Item analysis was performed from the item response theory. The results evidenced the unidimensionality of the item pool, with difficulty indexes and ability levels covering most of the measured continuum. As regard reliability indexes (persons and items), we observed that the allocation of persons and items might be reproduced in a predictable way. Global fit of items was suitable in most of them. We also performed two analyses of the evidence of the validity of the scores obtained through the Career Decision Making Self-Efficacy-Item Bank. We carried out a simulation study to determine the real level of ability of the subjects, providing information on the quality of the item bank developed to accurately assess career decision self-efficacy. Thus, we conducted a concurrent validity evidence study to establish test-criterion relationships between career decision self-efficacy and the more significant outcome variables of the career decision-making process: career decision, career indecision, and decisional anxiety. In summary, we developed, calibrated, and validated the first item bank to estimate the central construct of the career decision-making process, which is the first step to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test. Based on this technology, personalized evaluations of specific skills or traits such as career decision self-efficacy can be obtained and incorporated into computer-assisted career guidance systems.

JO  - J Med Internet Res
VL  - 22
PY  - 2020
PB  - JMIR Publications
CY  - NA
AB  - Background: There is a need for shorter-length assessments that capture patient questionnaire data while attaining high data quality without an undue response burden on patients. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods have the potential to meet these needs and can offer attractive options to shorten questionnaire lengths. Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT or CART was best suited to reduce the number of questionnaire items in multiple domains (eg, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and social support) used for a needs assessment procedure (NAP) within the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) without the loss of data quality. Methods: NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a Web-based portal, MyCARDSS, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results: With CAT and CART, an overall reduction of 36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length, respectively, was achieved, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT, 0.777 and 0.877 for classification trees, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees, respectively. Conclusions: Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the NAP used within the field of CR. CART, however, showed the best performance, with a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress in multiple domains. For CR professionals, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their patients by providing real-time patient measurements.

AB  - Comments on an article by Tony Cacace & Dennis McFarland (see record [rid]2013-34119-003[/rid]). Cacace and McFarland have written an interesting and provoking article on auditory processing. Cacace and McFarland's conclusion, that testing for auditory processing disorders (APD), included testing in other modalities is expressed strongly. The commentator completely agrees with Cacace & McFarland that it is necessary to disentangle, to the degree possible, the effects of cognitive abilities on auditory processing test scores. The use of adaptive test methods, with computer administration, and predefined stopping criteria dependent on test precision, as recommended by Cacace & McFarland, are key tools in constructing reliable tests. The differential test format also deals with the concern raised by Cacace & McFarland about verbal responses affecting test scores. Regarding Cacace & McFarland's suggestion that total computer administration be combined with a forced-choice design, the commentators would caution that there are potential pitfalls in this strategy, when testing is aimed at young children. Cacace and McFarland have stated that spoken responses are the result of complex motor skills. In summary, the commentators are in complete agreement with Cacace & McFarland that APD testing must be done in a manner that minimizes the effects of cognition on test scores.

AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-10 (CESD-10), and the 8-item PROMIS Depression Short Form (PROMIS-D-8; 8b short form) in a sample of individuals living with multiple sclerosis (MS). Research Method: Data were collected by a self-reported mailed survey of a community sample of people living with MS (n = 455). Factor structure, interitem reliability, convergent/discriminant validity and assignment to categories of depression severity were examined. Results: A 1-factor, confirmatory factor analytic model had adequate fit for all instruments. Scores on the depression scales were more highly correlated with one another than with scores on measures of pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. The CESD-10 categorized about 37% of participants as having significant depressive symptoms. At least moderate depression was indicated for 24% of participants by PHQ-9. PROMIS-D-8 identified 19% of participants as having at least moderate depressive symptoms and about 7% having at least moderately severe depression. None of the examined scales had ceiling effects, but the PROMIS-D-8 had a floor effect. Conclusions: Overall, scores on all 3 scales demonstrated essential unidimensionality and had acceptable interitem reliability and convergent/discriminant validity. Researchers and clinicians can choose any of these scales to measure depressive symptoms in individuals living with MS. The PHQ-9 offers validated cutoff scores for diagnosing clinical depression. The PROMIS-D-8 measure minimizes the impact of somatic features on the assessment of depression and allows for flexible administration, including Computerize Adaptive Testing (CAT). The CESD-10 measures 2 aspects of depression, depressed mood and lack of positive affect, while still providing an interpretable total score.

AB  - Purpose: This study assessed whether the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer-adaptive tests (CATs) provided results similar to those of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) with a low patient burden. Methods: Secondary data analysis of 136 prostate cancer patients who completed the 53-item BSI and the PROMIS CATs assessing depression, anxiety, and hostility. Results: The PROMIS CATs and BSI correlated significantly in measures of depression (.85), anxiety (.76), and anger/hostility (.66; p < .001 for all). Using our BSI cutoff points for depression, anxiety, and anger/hostility, ROC analysis yielded areas under the curve of .966 [standard error (SE) = .014, p < .001], .975 (SE = .012, p < .001), and .952 (SE = .027, p < .001), respectively. Conclusions: PROMIS CATs were highly correlated with the BSI subscales, indicating that the CATs performed well compared with the BSI, a widely used psychosocial measure.

AB  - The current study developed and examined the performance of a computerized adaptive version of the Social Interaction Anxiety and Social Phobia Scales (SIAS/SPS) and compared results with a previously developed static short form (SIAS-6/SPS-6) in terms of measurement precision, concordance with the full forms, and sensitivity to treatment. Among an online sample of Australian adults, there were relatively minor differences in the performance of the adaptive tests and static short forms when compared with the full scales. Moreover, both adaptive and static short forms generated similar effect sizes across treatment in a clinical sample. This provides further evidence for the use of static or adaptive short forms of the SIAS/SPS rather than the lengthier 20-item versions. However, at the individual level, the adaptive tests were able to maintain an acceptable level of precision, using few items as possible, across the severity continua in contrast to the static short forms.

AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

AB  - Test equating allows direct comparison of test scores from alternative forms measuring the same construct by employing equating procedures to put the test scores on the same metric. Three equating procedures are commonly used in the literature including the concurrent calibration method, the linking separate calibration methods (e.g. the moment methods and the characteristic curve methods), and FPC (Fixed Parameter Calibration) method. The first two types of methods for traditional IRT model have been well developed. FPC is being emphasized recently because of its utility for constructing item bank and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). However, there are few studies that examine the equating accuracy of the FPC method compared to that of the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method. The equating methods for the traditional IRT model are not appropriate for linking testlet-based tests because the local independence assumption of IRT model cannot be held for this type of tests. Some measurement models, such as testlet response model, bi-factor model, and Rasch testlet model, were advanced to calibrate the models for the testlet-based tests. Few equating methods, however, that take into consideration the additional local dependence among the examinees' responses to items within testlets have been developed for linking testelet-based tests. To address the need to better understand the FPC method and to develop new equating methods for linking testlet-based tests, the studies were to compare the effectiveness of the three types of equating methods under different linking situations and to develop equating methods for linking testlet-based tests. Besides the equating methods concerned, other factors, including sample size, ability distribution, and characteristics of common items and testlets that might affect equating results were also considered. Three simulation studies were carried out to accomplish the research purposes. The first study compared the equating accuracies of the FPC, the linking separate calibration, and the concurrent calibration method based on the IRT model to equate item parameters under different conditions. The results indicated that the FPC method using BILOG-MG performed as well as the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method for linking the equivalent groups. However, the FPC method produced larger equating errors than the other two methods did when the ability distributions of the base and target groups were substantially nonequivalent. Differences in difficulties between the common items set and the total test did not substantially affect the equating results with the three methods, with other conditions being held equal. As expected, both small sample size and less number of common items led to slight greater equating errors. The second study developed an item characteristic curve method and a testlet characteristic curve method for the testlet response model to transform the scale of item parameters. It then compared the effectiveness of the characteristic curve methods and the concurrent calibration methods under different conditions in linking item parameters from alternate test forms which were composed of dichotomously scored testlet-based items. The newly developed item characteristic curve method and the testlet characteristic curve method were shown to perform similarly as or even better than the Stocking-Lord test characteristic curve method and the concurrent calibration method did. Ignoring the local dependence in model calibration substantially increased equating errors. And larger testlet variances for the common testlets led to greater equating errors. The last study used the concurrent calibration method under the multidimensional Rasch testlet model to link the testlet-based tests in which the testlets were composed of dichotomous, polytomous, and mixed-format items.

AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by Robert D. Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2014-06810-010[/rid]). To assess anxiety, Gibbons et al. developed an inventory of 431 questions from initial tests in 798 patients. They developed algorithms to select questions that would produce good agreement between answers to a limited set of questions and the answers to all the questions. The Gibbons et al. approach is a truly outstanding contribution to measurement in medicine it is novel and exciting, and it promises to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of diagnosis both in clinical practice and in research. In short, computerized adaptive testing measures might well be adopted into all current research studies addressing depression and anxiety, first because they might add to the detection of crucial signals in such studies, and second because their use would document where and how best to use these measures in clinical practice.

AB  - The present study investigated the implications of computer-adaptive testing (operationalized by way of multistage adaptive testing; MAT) and 'conventional' fixed order computer testing for various test-relevant outcomes in numeracy, including achievement, test-relevant motivation and engagement, and subjective test experience. It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students<e2><80><99> test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students<e2><80><99> test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Educational Impact and Implications Statement<e2><80><94>With the growth in computer-based educational assessment, there are new opportunities to tailor testing to the characteristics and needs of students. Computer-adaptive testing is one such opportunity. Computer-adaptive testing presents items or sets of items (e.g., testlets) in a way to match different students<e2><80><99> abilities. Based on a large-scale numeracy assessment exercise in Australia, our study showed that computer-adaptive testing assessed achievement accurately, had positive effects for key parts of students<e2><80><99> test motivation and engagement, and benefited adolescent students who are at an age when they are typically less motivated and engaged. Computer-adaptive testing may therefore be a means to promote more positive experiences for students as they participate in computer-based and online educational testing.

AB  - In this review we explore recent developments in computerized adaptive diagnostic screening and computerized adaptive testing for the presence and severity of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and mania. The statistical methodology is unique in that it is based on multidimensional item response theory (severity) and random forests (diagnosis) instead of traditional mental health measurement based on classical test theory (a simple total score) or unidimensional item response theory. We show that the information contained in large item banks consisting of hundreds of symptom items can be efficiently calibrated using multidimensional item response theory, and the information contained in these large item banks can be precisely extracted using adaptive administration of a small set of items for each individual. In terms of diagnosis, computerized adaptive diagnostic screening can accurately track an hour-long face-to-face clinician diagnostic interview for major depressive disorder (as an example) in less than a minute using an average of four questions with unprecedented high sensitivity and specificity. Directions for future research and applications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the amount of time spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items. Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels. A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners' manual. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In recent years, comparisons between computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and paper-and-pencil tests (P&Ps) have focused less on equivalency and more on the construct validity of shifting between the modalities. Examinee motivation is one area of concern, including test and computer anxiety. One type of motivation, flow, has a characteristic pattern of development similar to the pattern of item selection in CAT. Flow theory posits that positive reinforcement is gained through the sensation of achieving optimal performance. This study attempts to determine whether CAT facilitates flow in examinees, enabling them to perform better than on P&Ps. Covariates like test and computer anxiety, academic achievement, and certain personality traits are taken into account. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 94 middle-school CAT examinees to 65 middle-school P&P examinees on their responses to the Flow State Scale 2 (FSS-2), and regression modeling revealed a significant interaction between test modality and test anxiety on state flow, and significant effects for trait flow, typical study time, gender, and ethnicity when controlling for other covariates. Significant effects on specific flow dimensions were also found. The effect of flow on test performance was examined, but may have been limited by sample size. Reliability and dimensionality was confirmed for several instruments, some for the first time with an adolescent population: FSS-2, the Dispositional Flow Scale 2, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Test Anxiety Inventory-Short Form, and the Computer Attitude Scale. Interviews with students were also conducted to confirm the validity of measuring flow in testing situations. Implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - Explored the possibilities for using computerized adaptive testing in situations in which examinees are to be classified into 1 of 3 categories. Testing algorithms with 2 different statistical computation procedures are described and evaluated. The 1st computation procedure is based on statistical testing and the other on statistical estimation. Item selection methods based on maximum information (MI) considering content and exposure control are considered. The measurement quality of the proposed testing algorithms is reported. The results of the study are that a reduction of at least 22% in the mean number of items can be expected in a computerized adaptive test compared to an existing paper-and-pencil placement test. Furthermore, the results suggest that statistical testing is a promising alternative to statistical estimation. Finally, it is concluded that imposing constraints on the MI selection strategy does not negatively affect the quality of the testing algorithms.

AB  - In a randomized experiment (n=515), a computerized and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) are compared. The item pool consists of 24 polytomous motivation items. Although items are carefully selected, calibration data show that Samejima's graded response model did not fit the data optimally. A simulation study is done to assess possible consequences of model misfit. CAT efficiency was studied by a systematic comparison of the CAT with two types of conventional fixed length short forms, which are created to be good CAT competitors. Results showed no essential administration mode effects. Efficiency analyses show that CAT outperformed the short forms in almost all aspects when results are aggregated along the latent trait scale. The real and the simulated data results are very similar, which indicate that the real data results are not affected by model misfit. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Item selection procedures designed for computerized adaptive testing need to accurately estimate every taker's trait level (<ce><b8>) and, at the same time, effectively use all items in a bank. Empirical studies showed that classical item selection procedures based on maximizing Fisher or other related information yielded highly varied item exposure rates; with these procedures, some items were frequently used whereas others were rarely selected. In the literature, methods have been proposed for controlling exposure rates; they tend to affect the accuracy in <ce><b8> estimates, however. A modified version of the maximum Fisher information (MFI) criterion, coined the nearest neighbors (NN) criterion, is proposed in this study. The NN procedure improves to a moderate extent the undesirable item exposure rates associated with the MFI criterion and keeps sufficient precision in estimates. The NN criterion will be compared with a few other existing methods in an empirical study using the mean squared errors in <ce><b8> estimates and plots of item exposure rates associated with different distributions.

AB  - Determined how computerized adaptive testing (CMAT) affected 628 college and university examinees (aged 17<e2><80><93>55 yrs) and whether examinees of different ethnic, gender, ability, age, and computer-experienced groups were differentially affected. Ss were 57.8% female, 42.2% male, 63.5% White, 9.7% Black, 20.7% Hispanic, and 3.5% Oriental. 30.5% of the Ss reported frequent use of a computer, 45.6% indicated occasional use, 20.2% reported using a computer once or twice, and 3.7% had never used a computer. Although some differences existed between the various groups, these differences did not affect Ss' performance on the test, with 2 exceptions: reading problems on the reading test and computer anxiety. A feeling of anxiety in the CMAT was related to (1) Ss' prior experience with computers, (2) ability, and (3) ethnic and gender group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tracked the effect of candidate response patterns on a computerized adaptive test. Data were from a certification examination in laboratory science administered in 1992 to 155 candidates, using a computerized adaptive algorithm. The 90-item certification examination was divided into 9 units of 10 items each to track the pattern of initial responses and response alterations on ability estimates and test precision across the 9 test units. The precision of the test was affected most by response alterations during early segments of the test. While candidates generally benefited from altering responses, individual candidates showed different patterns of response alterations across test segments. Test precision was minimally affected, suggesting that the tailoring of computerized adaptive testing is minimally affected by response alterations.

AB  - Objective: At least half of youths with mental disorders are unrecognized and untreated. Rapid, accurate assessment of child mental disorders could facilitate identification and referral and potentially reduce the occurrence of functional disability that stems from early-onset mental disorders. Method: Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) based on multidimensional item response theory were developed for depression, anxiety, mania/hypomania, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and suicidality, based on parent and child ratings of 1,060 items each. In phase 1, CATs were developed from 801 participants. In phase 2, predictive, discriminant, and convergent validity were tested against semi-structured research interviews for diagnoses and suicidality in 497 patients and 104 healthy controls. Overall strength of association was determined by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The child and parent independently completed the Kiddie<e2><88><92>Computerized Adaptive Tests (K-CATs) in a median time of 7.56 and 5.03 minutes, respectively, with an average of 7 items per domain. The K-CATs accurately captured the presence of diagnoses (AUCs from 0.83 for generalized anxiety disorder to 0.92 for major depressive disorder) and suicidal ideation (AUC = 0.996). Strong correlations with extant measures were found (r <e2><89><a5> 0.60). Test<e2><88><92>retest reliability averaged r = 0.80. Conclusion: These K-CATs provide a new approach to child psychopathology screening and measurement. Testing can be completed by child and parent in less than 8 minutes and yields results that are highly convergent with much more time-consuming structured clinical interviews and dimensional severity assessment and measurement. Testing of the implementation of the K-CAT is now indicated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Quality of life (QoL) assessments, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), are becoming increasingly important in health care and have been associated with improved decision making, higher satisfaction, and better outcomes of care. Some physicians and patients may find questionnaires too burdensome; however, this issue could be addressed by making use of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In addition, making the questionnaire more interesting, for example by providing graphical and contextualized feedback, may further improve the experience of the users. However, little is known about how shorter assessments and feedback impact user experience. Objective: We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the impact of tailored multimodal feedback and CAT on user experience in QoL assessment using validated PROMs. Methods: We recruited a representative sample from the general population in the United Kingdom using the Oxford Prolific academic Web panel. Participants completed either a CAT version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-CAT) or the fixed-length WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100. We randomly assigned participants to conditions in which they would receive no feedback, graphical feedback only, or graphical and adaptive text-based feedback. Participants rated the assessment in terms of perceived acceptability, engagement, clarity, and accuracy. Results: We included 1386 participants in our analysis. Assessment experience was improved when graphical and tailored text-based feedback was provided along with PROMs (<ce><94> = 0.22, P < .001). Providing graphical feedback alone was weakly associated with improvement in overall experience (<ce><94> = 0.10, P = .006). Graphical and text-based feedback made the questionnaire more interesting, and users were more likely to report they would share the results with a physician or family member (<ce><94> = 0.17, P < .001, and <ce><94> = 0.17, P < .001, respectively). No difference was found in perceived accuracy of the graphical feedback scores of the WHOQOL-CAT and WHOQOL-BREF (<ce><94> = 0.06, P = .05). CAT (stopping rule [SE < 0.45]) resulted in the administration of 25% fewer items than the fixed-length assessment, but it did not result in an improved user experience (P = .21). Conclusions: Using tailored text-based feedback to contextualize numeric scores maximized the acceptability of electronic QoL assessment. Improving user experience may increase response rates and reduce attrition in research and clinical use of PROMs. In this study, CAT administration was associated with a modest decrease in assessment length but did not improve user experience. Patient-perceived accuracy of feedback was equivalent when comparing CAT with fixed-length assessment. Fixed-length forms are already generally acceptable to respondents; however, CAT might have an advantage over longer questionnaires that would be considered burdensome. Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between assessment length, feedback, and response burden in diverse populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared the efficiency, reliability, validity, and motivational benefits of computerized adaptive tests and self-adapted music listening tests (CAT and SAT, respectively). 53 junior high school music students (mean age 13.04 yrs) completed a tonal memory CAT, a tonal memory SAT, standardized music aptitude and achievement tests; and questionnaires assessing test anxiety, demographics, and attitudes about the CAT and SAT. Standardized music test scores and music course grades served as criterion measures in the concurrent validity analysis. Results showed that the SAT elicited more favorable attitudes from examinees and yielded ability estimates that were higher and less correlated with test anxiety than did the CAT. The CAT, however, required fewer items and less administration time to match the reliability and concurrent validity of the SAT and yielded higher levels of reliability and concurrent validity than the SAT when test length was held constant. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) is quickly becoming the test mode of choice among many high-stakes testing agencies. Although some researchers suggest that CAT is comparable, if not better, than traditional paper-and-pencil testing, others have suggested that individual differences among examinees have not been fully explored. In particular, the additional cognitive demands imposed by CAT are not well understood. For example, in the CAT mode there is the added demand of moving back and forth from computer screen to scrap paper when one has to solve more complex problems. In traditional paper and-pencil (P&P) testing environments, there is but one mode with which to contend: paper-and-pencil. In addition, CAT may generate greater anxiety-which further increases cognitive load-among some test-takers than would be found with more traditional testing modes. For example, with CAT you cannot go back to review previous items or change previous answers. And CAT requires something that is anxiety provoking in and of itself for some individuals: use of a computer. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects, particularly the cognitive effects, of different testing environments on individual test-taker experience. Forty undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions: CAT mode or P&P testing mode. All subjects took the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination. Methodology for the study included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil instruments, videotaped recording of subject behavior, observation, and interview. Verbal protocol analysis of subsamples of subjects' work-toward-solution behavior on two analytical reasoning problems was also included. Results of multivariate and univariate analyses suggest significant differences across test mode, with respect to cognitive demands. Compared to subjects in the paper-and-pencil test mode, CAT subjects had significantly longer response times on analytical reasoning (AR) problems, relied more on scrap paper to model AR problems diagrammatically, and employed different problem-solving strategies. Differences in affective responses-including anxiety and frustration-further suggest test mode effects were present. CAT subjects expressed significantly more frustration with the test mode than did their P&P counterparts. Furthermore, CAT subjects with low computer confidence experienced significantly higher levels of test anxiety than did their more computer-confident peers. Implications for test developers and recommendations for further research are offered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Up to 65% of individuals demonstrate poststroke cognitive impairments, which may increase hospital stay and caregiver burden. Randomized stroke clinical trials have emphasized physical recovery over cognition. Neuropsychological assessments have had limited utility in randomized clinical trials. These issues accentuate the need for a measure of functional cognition (the ability to accomplish everyday activities that rely on cognitive abilities, such as locating keys, conveying information, or planning activities). Objective: The aim of the study was to present the process used to establish domains of functional cognition for development of computer adaptive measure of functional cognition for stroke. Methods: Functional cognitive domains involved in identifying relevant neuropsychological constructs from the literature were conceptualized and finalized after advisory panel feedback from experts in neurology, neuropsychology, aphasiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology. Results: The following 17 domains were proposed: receptive aphasia, expressive aphasia, agraphia, alexia, calculation, visuospatial, visuoperceptual, visuoconstruction, attention, language usage, executive functions, orientation, processing speed, memory, working memory, mood, awareness and abstract reasoning. The advisory panel recommended retaining the first 12 domains. Recommended changes included: to address only encoding and retrieval of recent information in the memory domain; to add domains for limb apraxia and poststroke depression; and to keep orientation as a separate domain or reclassify it under memory or attention. The final 10 domains included: language, reading and writing, numeric/calculation, limb praxis, visuospatial function, social use of language, emotional function, attention, executive function, and memory. Conclusion: Conceptualizing domains of functional cognition is the first step in developing a computer adaptive measure of functional cognition for stroke. Additional steps include developing, refining, and field-testing items, psychometric analysis, and computer adaptive test programming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Primary objective: To conceptualize functional cognitive constructs across the continuum of traumatic brain injury (TBI) recovery, to form the foundation for the Computer Adaptive Measure of Functional Cognition for TBI (CAMFC-TBI). Background: TBI often has a profound impact on a survivor<e2><80><99>s ability to return to previous level of functioning and significantly reduces the overall quality of life for survivors and caregivers. Few assessments are designed to evaluate TBI<e2><80><99>s impact on cognitive functioning in everyday life. Neuropsychological tests are time consuming and may have questionable ecological validity for predicting functional outcomes. Global functional assessments contain few cognitive items and may lack psychometric rigour. Presently there is a lack of efficient, precise, ecologically valid functional cognitive measures. Main outcome and results: Studies that used neuropsychological and global functional assessments were reviewed to direct conceptualization of functional cognitive constructs across TBI recovery stages. An advisory panel reviewed study methodology and functional cognitive constructs development. They validated the need for the CAMFC-TBI and the six functional cognitive constructs: attention, memory, processing speed, executive functioning, social communication and emotional management. Conclusion: Conceptualizing functional cognitive constructs is the first step in CAMFC-TBI development. Future project stages include item pool development, qualitative testing, field-testing, psychometric analysis and computerized adaptive test programming.

AB  - We investigated the effects of test anxiety on test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) versus conventional fixed item testing (FIT). We hypothesized that tests containing mainly items with medium probabilities of being solved would have negative effects on test performance for testtakers high in test anxiety. A total of 110 students (aged 16 to 20) from a German secondary modern school filled out a short form of the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI-G; Wacker, Jaunzeme, & Jaksztat, 2008) and then were presented with items from the Adaptive Matrices Test (AMT; Hornke, Etzel, & Rettig, 1999) on the computer, either in CAT form or in a fixed item test form with a selection of items arranged in order of increasing item difficulty. Additionally, half of the students were given a short summary of information about the mode of item selection in adaptive testing before working on the CAT. In a moderated regression approach, a significant interaction of test anxiety and test mode was revealed. The effect of test mode on the AMT score was stronger for students with higher scores on test anxiety than for students with lower test anxiety. Furthermore, getting information about CAT led to significantly better results than receiving standard test instructions. Results are discussed with reference to test fairness.

AB  - The Personality Inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD) was recently developed to assess the ICD-11 model of personality disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the construct validity of the PiCD using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) and the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorders Static Form (CAT-PD-SF). We administered these tests to 328 college students (150 males, 178 females). We found that the PiCD had adequate internal consistency reliability. Correlations between scores from the PiCD scales and the criterion measures generally indicated adequate discriminant validity. Along the same lines, convergent validity was adequate for the PiCD Negative Affective, Disinhibition, and Dissocial scales. However, the evidence was more mixed for the PiCD Detachment and Anankastic domains, which may be due to limitations with the content domains for these scales. Consistent with other research and theoretical expectations, a conjoint exploratory factor analysis utilizing the PiCD and MMPI-2-RF PSY-5 scales also indicated that anankastic and disinhibition may be more appropriately conceptualized as measuring opposite poles of one construct. Implications of these findings for the PiCD and the ICD-11 model are discussed.

AB  - We evaluated construct validity, responsiveness, and utility of change indicators of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS adult v1.0 item banks for Depression and Anxiety administered as computerized adaptive test (CAT). Specifically, the CATs were compared to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) using pre- and re-test data of adult patients treated for common mental disorders (N = 400; median pre-to-re-test interval = 215 days). Construct validity was evaluated with Pearson<e2><80><99>s correlations and Cohen<e2><80><99>s ds; responsiveness with Pearson<e2><80><99>s correlations and pre-post effect sizes (ES); utility of change indicators with kappa coefficients and percentages of (dis)agreement. The results showed that the PROMIS CATs measure similar constructs as matching BSI scales. Under the assumption of measuring similar constructs, the CAT and BSI Depression scales were similarly responsive. For the Anxiety scales, we found a higher responsiveness for CAT (ES = 0.64) compared to the BSI (ES = 0.50). Finally, both CATs categorized the change scores of more patients as changed compared to matching BSI scales, indicating that the PROMIS CATs may be more able to detect actual change than the BSI. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement over matching BSI scales as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients. We discuss several additional differences between the PROMIS CATs and the BSI to help test users choose instruments. These differences include the adopted measurement theory (Item Response Theory vs. Classical Test Theory), the mode of administration (CAT vs. fixed items), and the area of application (universal vs. predominantly clinical). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) This study suggests that PROMIS CATs for Depression and Anxiety measure the same constructs as matching BSI subscales in Dutch adult patients treated for common mental disorders, are at least as able to detect change over time, and categorize the change scores of more patients as actually changed. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

AB  - School districts across the country are meeting the accountability challenges set forth by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) federal legislation, as well as challenges put forth at their state and local levels. Districts' accountability efforts have often brought them to contract with outside organizations offering standardized assessments for progress monitoring of students in intervention programs, and for on-going local assessments for program evaluation and planning. One such organization, Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), has developed several computer-based testing products to assist districts in their accountability and teaching/learning efforts. Their flagship product, Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), is a computerized-adaptive test (CAT), and is typically delivered on-line to districts. Using Item Response Theory (IRT) selection algorithms, test questions are selected based on students' answers throughout the test experience. Students are presented with their first question (item) based on a predetermined value of their ability from previous testing and what is known about the item (Baker, 2001). Once they respond to the item, the software calibrates a temporary achievement level for that student, and selects their next question based on their estimated competency. Use of such powerful test assembly methods can enable a test to derive precise performance information about each student. Tests are assembled on demand, and results are immediately available to instructors and district personnel. While precise information at a broader range of abilities is possible using such test assembly methods, item selection processes typically present items in a randomized order to maximize item bank usage, test security, and measurement properties. Little research has been done on item order with young test takers in the elementary grades, and the literature on item order with regard to computerized adaptive testing is silent. Of particular interest was whether a content-clustered version of a computerized adaptive test would result in stronger performance with young test takers, and whether the efficient testing processes already available via on-line testing could be improved. Data was reviewed in light of demographic sub-groups, including gender, ethnicity, and grade level. The current study delivered both the standard version of a computerized adaptive test, MAP, along with a modified version, to a test population of 6589 students in a large southern U.S. school district of second, third, fourth and fifth graders. Using a double-blind selection process, half of the students received the standard MAP, and half received the modified version, which clustered items by goal strand across the five sub-tests of the assessment. The study indicated that overall scores on MAP are not increased by content clustering, nor are there significant time gains on the overall test, for all students as a whole. However, results do indicate areas of significance with regard to ethnic sub-group differences. Overall test performance was stronger for African Americans on the modified version, while overall test duration was reduced for the three major ethnic sub-groups, particularly Hispanics. Boys improved their scores overall on the modified version, and gender differences on goal strands were present, which may indicate that certain goal strands scores increase under clustered conditions.

AB  - The benefits of adaptive testing, reduced test length and increased measurement precision, are in part achieved through the application of a maximum-information item selection algorithm. While such an algorithm is an effective means for tailoring the difficulty of adaptive tests to examinee ability, its use with multidimensional content domains might result in examinations that lack content validity. Licensure and certification examinations typically assess knowledge of multidimensional content domains. As such, balancing test content is an important consideration for these types of tests. This study investigated the effects of content balancing on an adaptive licensure and certification examination. A computer simulation was used with data distributions attained from previous administrations of a conventional test. The performance of the adaptive test was examined under four content-balancing methods and fifteen stopping rules. The results showed that employing a rigorous content-balancing method had no significant adverse effect on the efficiency or accuracy of the adaptive test under study. Findings, also indicated that ability estimation bias contributed to slight inaccuracies in the determination of the passing status for examinees whose abilities were near the minimum passing ability. The findings of this study support the use of adaptive testing for licensure and certification examinations under the following conditions: rigorous content balancing is employed, the item bank contains a sufficient number of items to optimally measure a range of abilities, and if estimation bias is found to affect the pass/fail decision, it is corrected. Implications of these findings are discussed for school certification testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The 22-item PROMIS<c2><ae>-Rx Pain Medication Misuse item bank (Bank-22) imposes a high response burden. This study aimed to characterize the performance of the Bank-22 in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) setting based on varied stopping rules. Methods: The 22 items were administered to 288 patients. We performed a CAT simulation using default stopping rules (CATPROMIS). In 5 other simulations, a 'best health' response rule was added to decrease response burden. This rule stopped CAT administration when a participant selected 'never' to a specified number of initial Bank-22 items (2<e2><80><93>6 in this study, designated CATAlt2-Alt6). The Bank-22 and 7-item short form (SF-7) scores were compared to scores based on CATPROMIS, and the 5 CAT variations. Results: Bank-22 scores correlated highly with the SF-7 and CATPROMIS, Alt5, Alt6 scores (r=0.87<e2><80><93>0.95) and moderately with CATAlt2-Alt4 scores (r=0.63<e2><80><93>0.74). In all CAT conditions, the greatest differences with Bank-22 scores were at the lower end of misuse T-scores. The smallest differences with Bank-22 and CATPROMIS scores were observed with CATAlt5 and CATAlt6. Compared to the SF-7, CATAlt5 and CATAlt6 reduced overall response burden by about 42%. Finally, the correlations between PROMIS-Rx Misuse and Anxiety T-scores remained relatively unchanged across the conditions (r=0.31<e2><80><93>0.43, Ps < .001). Conclusions: Applying a stopping rule based on number of initial 'best health' responses reduced response burden for respondents with lower levels of misuse. The tradeoff was less measurement precision for those individuals, which could be an acceptable tradeoff when the chief concern is in discriminating higher levels of misuse.

AB  - Background: Measurement instruments that are used for monitoring patients in mental health care are developed according to the principles of classical test theory. Because the assumptions underlying this theory are outdated, this is a good time to work towards a new method of measurement known as computerised adaptive testing (CAT), the method being based on item response theory. Aim: To introduce the CAT-methodology into Dutch mental health care, and provide an overview of the current and desirable developments. Method: We explain what CAT is and why mental health care should warmly welcome this new development. We also outline the limitations of CAT, summarise the developments that have already been made nationally and internationally and consider some developments we think are desirable. Results: PROMIS item banks for anxiety and depression for adults show that CAT is more efficient than instruments currently in use and is able to produce very precise outcomes. Conclusion: The first CATS for anxiety and depression will be available late 2017 or early 2018 for adults receiving mental health care in the Netherlands. Recent results are very impressive and CAT-technology will increase the efficiency of symptom measurements, bringing these measurements to a higher level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Achtergrond: Meetinstrumenten die worden gebruikt voor het monitoren van de behandeluitkomst bij pati<c3><ab>nten in de ggz zijn ontwikkeld op basis van de principes uit de klassieke testtheorie. Omdat de aannames achter deze theorie achterhaald zijn, is het tijd om toe te werken naar een nieuwe meetmethode die is gebaseerd op de itemresponstheorie: computergestuurd adaptief testen (CAT). Doel: De CAT-methodiek introduceren bij de Nederlandse ggz, en een overzicht geven van de huidige en toekomstige ontwikkelingen. Methode: We lichten toe wat CAT is, wat de voordelen zijn voor de ggz, wat de beperkingen zijn, welke nationale en internationale ontwikkelingen er al zijn geweest, en welke ontwikkelingen nog wenselijk zijn. Resultaten: De patient-reported outcomes measurement information system(PROMIS)-itembanken voor angst en depressie voor volwassenen illustreren dat het mogelijk is om met CAT effici<c3><ab>nter te meten dan met het klassieke meetinstrumentarium, met zeer precieze uitkomsten. Conclusie: Eind 2017, begin 2018 komen de eerste gevalideerde CAT<e2><80><99>s voor angst en depressie beschikbaar voor volwassenen in de ggz. De huidige resultaten zijn veelbelovend en de CAT-technologie brengt meten in de ggz op een hoger plan. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

Categorical (yes/no) measures of positive anxiety and depression screens, as well as total symptom scores, were measured longitudinally across the perinatal period in 178 women (115 non-Hispanic Black, 63 Latina) using the CAT-MH, a computerized adaptive test. Time (up to 4 visits) and race/ethnicity effects were assessed in linear mixed effects models. Rates of positive anxiety screenings were 13.6%, 3.2%, 8.5%, and 0% in Latina women and 2.6%, 4.2%, 6.1%, and 5.8% in non-Hispanic Black women in the 1(st), 2(nd), and 3(rd) trimesters, and postpartum, respectively. Rates of positive anxiety screenings overall were highest in the first trimester (OR = 0.20; 95% CI 0.04-0.98), and there was a significant time-by-race/ethnicity interaction for positive anxiety screens (OR = 8.88; 95% CI 1.42-55.51), as positive screens were most frequent in the first trimester and sharply declined for Latina women, while rates were relatively consistent across the perinatal period in non-Hispanic Black women. Rates of positive depression screens did not change over time, but there was a trend (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 0.93-4.03) for a time-by-race/ethnicity interaction in a direction similar to that seen for anxiety. The odds of positive anxiety screens vary by race/ethnicity and trimester, suggesting that anxiety screening and anxiety interventions may be most resourcefully used in the first trimester for Latina women in particular.

AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context. The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24 p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature. Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

AB  - Concussion is an increasingly recognized public health concern. Proper assessment and management of concussion are critical factors in mitigating adverse effects associated with this injury. Neuropsychological assessment has demonstrated utility in identifying cognitive symptoms related to concussion and monitoring their resolution. Early methods involved administering paper and pencil tests to appraise cognitive domains thought to be most affected by concussion. As interest in concussion and methods of assessment evolved, baseline testing became an integral component of assessment in sport-related concussion (SRC). Baseline testing consists of administering a healthy, or non-injured, individual a battery of cognitive tests that subsequently serve as a reference point to evaluate the individual's performance on the same tests following a suspected injury or change in cognitive status. Recent advances, spurred by an interest in increasing access to baseline testing, contributed to the adoption of computerized neurocognitive tests (CNTs). CNTs allow for baseline testing of groups of individuals, in one setting, and in a short amount of time. Immediate Post Concussion and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) has emerged as the most commonly used CNT in the assessment and management of SRC. This body of research aimed to explore ImPACT's reliability and validity to appraise its efficacy in accurately detecting cognitive change associated with concussion and explore potential improvements. The first chapter is devoted to examining ImPACT's test-retest reliability, which refers to the expected consistency in results over time in healthy individuals. This study examines ImPACT score reports for 107 healthy individuals that included testing at two time points. Results reveal less than adequate test-retest reliability attributable to, at least in part, a restricted range of possible scores, or the presence of a ceiling effect, on numerous subscales. Additional discussion includes corrective measures, such as proactively identifying individuals producing maximum scores on baseline testing, extending the length of subscales, and incorporating adaptive testing. The second chapter evaluates ImPACT's validity, and specifically, its classification accuracy in differentiating between individuals with and without concussion. This study incorporates a novel approach through its use of standardized regression based (SRB) reliable change index (RCI) scores to measure post-injury testing deviations from baseline scores. The SRB methodology, coupled with discriminant function analyses (DFAs), is compared to current interpretive procedures. The study includes 129 individuals without concussion whose SRB RCI scores are compared to 81 individuals with concussion. Results of analyses suggest that the current interpretive procedure performs at a chance level in accurately identifying individuals with concussion; conversely, the SRB method and DFA approach yield positive predictive values exceeding 80%, however sensitivities below 50%. Additionally, the Post Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), a self-report measure of symptoms, is largely equivalent to ImPACT's cognitive measures in classification accuracy. Collectively, these results raise considerable concern regarding ImPACT's efficacy as a measure to aid in the assessment and management of concussion.

AB  - Time use studies uncover the organization of daily routine of families of children with disabilities. The objective of this study is to identify determinants of time spent caring for children/adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typical development (TD). Participants were caregivers of children/adolescents with/without disability. Structural equation modeling tested a proposed model of time spent in child care. The variables in the model were as follows: questionnaire (families<e2><80><99> socioeconomic status [SES]), children<e2><80><99>s functioning (The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory<e2><80><93>Computer Adaptive Test [PEDI-CAT]); hours of care (daily diaries), number of adaptations used, and help with child care (parents<e2><80><99> report). Distinct variable combinations explained 78% of the variation in the time to care (TD model), followed by 42% (ASD) and 29% (CP). Adaptations indirectly affected time to care through its effect on functioning (CP); family<e2><80><99>s SES affected functioning through its effect on adaptation use (ASD). In conclusion, knowledge of factors affecting caregivers<e2><80><99> time spent on children<e2><80><99>s care help occupational therapists implement family-centered strategies.

AB  - Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper and Pencil (P&P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate <ce><b8>. For the item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, <e2><80><a6>, 20, and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of the P&P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S (r > 0.5), (4) the value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the theoretically expected advantages, which enabled a rapid, accurate, and efficient dynamic and intelligent measurement of stress.

AB  - Highly efficient assessments that better account for comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders (internalizing) are required to identify individuals who are most at risk of psychopathology in the community. The current study examined the efficiency and validity associated with a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure broad and specific levels of internalizing psychopathology. The sample comprised 3,175 respondents to an online survey. Items from five banks (generalized anxiety, depression, obsessive<e2><80><93>compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder) were jointly calibrated using a bifactor item response theory model. Simulations indicated that an adaptive algorithm could accurately (rs <e2><89><a5> 0.90) estimate general internalizing and specific disorder scores using on average 44 items in comparison with the full 133-item bank (67% reduction in items). Scores on the CAT demonstrate convergent and divergent validity with previously validated short severity scales and could significantly differentiate cases of DSM-5 disorder. As such, the CAT validly measures both broad and specific constructs of internalizing disorders in a manner similar to the full item bank and a static brief form but with greater gains in efficiency and, therefore, a reduced degree of respondent burden.

AB  - Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has received increasing attention over the past few years in educational measurement. Like all other formats of CAT, item replenishment is an essential part of MCAT for its item bank maintenance and management, which governs retiring overexposed or obsolete items over time and replacing them with new ones. Moreover, calibration precision of the new items will directly affect the estimation accuracy of examinees<e2><80><99> ability vectors. In unidimensional CAT (UCAT) and cognitive diagnostic CAT, online calibration techniques have been developed to effectively calibrate new items. However, there has been very little discussion of online calibration in MCAT in the literature. Thus, this paper proposes new online calibration methods for MCAT based upon some popular methods used in UCAT. Three representative methods, Method A, the <e2><80><98>one EM cycle<e2><80><99> method and the <e2><80><98>multiple EM cycles<e2><80><99> method, are generalized to MCAT. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare the three new methods by manipulating three factors (test length, item bank design, and level of correlation between coordinate dimensions). The results showed that all the new methods were able to recover the item parameters accurately, and the adaptive online calibration designs showed some improvements compared to the random design under most conditions.

AB  - There is a lack of standardized and comprehensive outcome measures for pain trials that have adequate comparative information for relevant samples, that can be used across a variety of research applications, and that allow investigators to combine or compare groups with different demographic or disease characteristics. Measures based on classical test theory (CTT) have a number of limitations, including respondent burden, inability to compare measures putatively assessing the same construct, and assumptions about linearity that may be unwarranted. Item response theory (IRT) methods offer potential advantages, and there is a growing awareness of the potential of IRT to complement and even replace some traditional psychometric approaches. Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) will likely be used increasingly as the technology improves and familiarity with this approach grows. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommended that six core outcome domains should be considered when designing chronic pain clinical trials: (1) pain; (2) physical functioning; (3) emotional functioning; (4) participant ratings of improvement and satisfaction with treatment; (5) symptoms and adverse events; and (6) participant disposition.

AB  - Within the framework of item response theory (IRT), we developed a German version of an item bank, as well as a software application that can be employed to measure anxiety by means of a computer adaptive test (CAT). A sample of n = 2348 psychiatric and psychosomatic patients answered a set of up to 13 standardized questionnaires. 81 items drawn from these questionnaires were considered pertinent to the anxiety construct. Various tests were conducted to ensure the suitability of these items for an IRT-based assessment. After these tests, 50 items remained in the item bank and were calibrated using the Generalized Partial Credit Model. Simulation studies conducted on an independent sample of n = 1528 respondents indicate that 6-8 items suffice to measure the latent trait with high precision (standard error <e2><89><a4>0.32). CAT scores correlated highly with scores estimated from all available items (r = .97) and scale scores of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, state scale, r = .93). Within a routine clinical setting, 102 in-patients answered the Anxiety-CAT along with a number of established anxiety questionnaires. The correlation between the Anxiety-CAT and the STAI state scale was still high (r = .60), but lower than the correlations found in the simulation studies. The Anxiety-CAT was able to differentiate between mental health disorders in a similar manner as established questionnaires. These results suggest that the Anxiety-CAT does indeed exhibit the advantages expected from theory, but the results of further studies are needed in order to judge its full potential for research and clinical practice.

AB  - Objective: To develop and evaluate a computer adaptive test for the assessment of anxiety in cardiovascular rehabilitation patients (ACAT-cardio) that tailors an optimal test for each patient and enables precise and time-effective measurement. Design: Simulation study, validation study (against the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the physical component summary scale of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey), and longitudinal study (beginning and end of rehabilitation). Setting: Cardiac rehabilitation centers. Participants: Cardiovascular rehabilitation patients: simulation study sample (nZ106; mean age, 57.8y; 25.5% women) and validation and longitudinal study sample (nZ138; mean age, 58.6 and 57.9y, respectively; 16.7% and 12.1% women, respectively). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and ACAT-cardio. Results: The mean number of items was 9.2 with an average processing time of 1:13 minutes when an SE .50 was used as a stopping rule; with an SE .32, there were 28 items and a processing time of 3:47 minutes. Validity could be confirmed via correlations between .68 and .81 concerning convergent validity (ACAT-cardio vs Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale) and correlations between .47 and .30 concerning discriminant validity (ACAT-cardio vs 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical component summary scale). Sensitivity to change was moderate to high with standardized response means between .45 and .82. Conclusions: The ACAT-cardio shows good psychometric properties and provides the opportunity for an innovative and time-effective assessment of anxiety in cardiovascular rehabilitation. A more flexible stopping rule might further improve the ACAT-cardio. Additionally, testing in other cardiovascular populations would increase generalizability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes >.90). The P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may be a viable and efficient assessment method.

AB  - Simpler and more precise tools are needed to measure Taijin Kyofusho which is a culture-bound anxiety disorder in East Asian countries. This study aimed to develop and validate a short form and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) of Taijin Kyofusho Scale (TKS), as well as compare the measurement precision of the short form, the CAT version and its original version. Item Response Theory (IRT) method was used to develop static short form and to simulate CAT. The short form consisted of 12 items (a 61% reduction) and the CAT version consisted of average 11.72 items (a 62% reduction) from the original TKS, respectively. Both short form and CAT version have similar levels of accuracy and precision in comparison to the original scale at the group level. However, at the individual level, the CAT version can maintain a more consistent level of precision across the continuum of severity than the short form. The short form of the TKS is sufficient for an initial assessment or screening in the community population. And the CAT version of the TKS is more suitable for tailored treatments in the clinical practice, which could detect detailed changes in the severity of Taijin Kyofusho.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Musical Emotion Discrimination Task (MEDT) is a short, non-adaptive test of the ability to discriminate emotions in music. Test-takers hear two performances of the same melody, both played by the same performer but each trying to communicate a different basic emotion, and are asked to determine which one is 'happier', for example. The goal of the current study was to construct a new version of the MEDT using a larger set of shorter, more diverse music clips and an adaptive framework to expand the ability range for which the test can deliver measurements. The first study analysed responses from a large sample of participants (N = 624) to determine how musical features contributed to item difficulty, which resulted in a quantitative model of musical emotion discrimination ability rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT). This model informed the construction of the adaptive MEDT. A second study contributed preliminary evidence for the validity and reliability of the adaptive MEDT, and demonstrated that the new version of the test is suitable for a wider range of abilities. This paper therefore presents the first adaptive musical emotion discrimination test, a new resource for investigating emotion processing which is freely available for research use.

AB  - Background and aims: The focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multiâ€dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and riskâ€taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the itemâ€bank, (2) calibrate the itemâ€bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptomâ€specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CATâ€SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain. Design: Item bank construction, item calibration phase, CATâ€SUD validation phase. Setting: Primary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patientâ€toâ€patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles). Participants/cases: Calibration phase: the CATâ€SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CATâ€SUD. Measurements: A total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CATâ€SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis. Findings: Calibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multiâ€dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168â€item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100â€point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CATâ€SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20â€fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CATâ€SUD (AUC = 0.85). Conclusions: We have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multiâ€dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CATâ€SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

AB  - We used the Dutch<e2><80><93>Flemish version of the USA PROMIS adult V1.0 item bank for Anxiety as input for developing a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure the entire latent anxiety continuum. First, psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample (N = 2,010) showed that the 29-item bank has psychometric properties that are required for a CAT administration. Second, a post hoc CAT simulation showed efficient and highly precise measurement, with an average number of 8.64 items for the clinical sample, and 9.48 items for the general population sample. Furthermore, the accuracy of our CAT version was highly similar to that of the full item bank administration, both in final score estimates and in distinguishing clinical subjects from persons without a mental health disorder. We discuss the future directions and limitations of CAT development with the Dutch<e2><80><93>Flemish version of the PROMIS Anxiety item bank.

CY  - NA
AB  - Background: Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common mental disorders among children and adolescents, and it may seriously affect their growth, daily life, and learning. Self-report scales have been used for diagnosis, which require lengthy testing and personnel. Methods: A total of 1,241 adolescents were recruited from 16 junior- and senior-high schools in China. The initial item bank was selected from classical SAD scales according to the DSM-5. First, the optimal model was selected using item response theory (IRT) according to data fit. Then, per the IRT analysis, items that did not meet the psychometric requirements were deleted (e.g., discriminating values < 0.2). Consequently, a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for SAD was formed (CAT-SAD). Results: An average of 17 items per participant was required to achieve and maintain a 0.3 standard error of measurement in the SAD severity estimate. The estimated correlation of the CAT-SAD with the total 68-item test score was 0.955. CAT-SAD scores were strongly related to the probability of a SAD diagnosis with the Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale<e2><80><94>Child and Adolescent Version. Therefore, SAD could be accurately predicted by the CAT-SAD. Conclusions: Exploratory factor analyses revealed that SAD was unidimensional. The CAT-SAD, which has good reliability and validity and high sensitivity and specificity, provides an efficient test for adolescents with SAD as compared to standard paper-and-pencil tests. It can be used to diagnose varying degrees of SAD quickly and reliably and ease the burden on adolescents. Potential applications for inexpensive, efficient, and accurate screening of SAD are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

CY  - NA
AB  - Background/objective: Entrepreneurial behavior is of great importance nowadays owing to its significance in the generation of economic, social, personal, and cultural wellbeing. This behavior is influenced by cognitive and personality characteristics, as well as by socioeconomic and contextual factors. Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate entrepreneurial personality. Method: A bank of 120 items was created evaluating various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants (Mage = 42.34; SDage = 12.96). Results: The bank of items had an essentially unidimensional fit to the model. The CAT exhibited high accuracy for evaluating a wide range of <ce><b8> scores, using a mean of 16 items with a very low standard error (M = 0.157). Relative validity evidence for the CAT was obtained with two additional tests of entrepreneurial personality (the Battery for the Assessment of the Enterprising Personality and the Measure of Enterpreneurial Tendencies and Abilities), with correlations of .908 and .657, respectively. Conclusions: The CAT developed has appropriate psychometric properties for the evaluation of entrepreneurial people. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To develop a paper-and-pencil semi-adaptive test for 5 domains of health-related quality of life (PAT- 5D-QOL) based on item response theory (IRT). Methods: The questionnaire uses items from previously developed item banks for 5 domains: (1) walking, (2) handling objects, (3) daily activities, (4) pain or discomfort, and (5) feelings. For each domain, respondents are initially classified into 4 functional levels. Depending on the level, they are instructed to respond to a different set of 5 additional questions. IRT scores for each domain and overall health utility scores are obtained using a simple spreadsheet. The questions were selected using psychometric and conceptual criteria. The format of the questionnaire was developed through focus groups and cognitive interviews. Feasibility was tested in two population surveys. A simulation study was conducted to compare PAT-5D-QOL with a computerized adaptive test (CAT-5D-QOL) and a fixed questionnaire, developed from the same item banks, in terms of accuracy, bias, precision, and ceiling and floor effects. Results: Close to 90 % of the participants in feasibility studies followed the skip instructions properly. In a simulation study, scores on PAT-5D-QOL for all domains tended to be more accurate, more precise, less biased, and less affected by a ceiling effect than scores on a fixed IRT-based questionnaire of the same length. PAT-5D-QOL was slightly inferior to a fully adaptive instrument. Conclusions: PAT-5D-QOL is a novel, semi-adaptive, IRT-based measure of health-related quality of life with a broad range of potential applications.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a publicly available, psychometrically sound item bank and short forms for measuring resilience in any population, but especially resilience in individuals with chronic medical conditions or long-term disability. Research Methods: A panel of 9 experts including disability researchers, clinical psychologists, and health outcomes researchers developed a definition of resilience that guided item development. The rigorous methodology used focus groups, cognitive interviews, and modern psychometric theory quantitative methods, including item response theory (IRT). Items were administered to a sample of people with chronic medical conditions commonly associated with disability (N = 1,457) and to a general population sample (N = 300) representative of the Unites States general population with respect to age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Results: The final item bank includes 28 items calibrated to IRT with the scores on a T-metric. A mean of 50 represents the mean resilience in the general population sample. Four and eight item short forms are available, and their scores are highly correlated with the item bank score (r <e2><89><a5> .94). Reliability is excellent across most of the resilience continuum. Initial analyses provide strong support for validity of the score. Conclusions: The findings support reliability and validity of the University of Washington Resilience Scale (UWRS) for assessing resilience in any population, including individuals with chronic health conditions or disabilities. It can be administered using computerized adaptive testing or by short forms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact and Implications<e2><80><94>This study describes the development and psychometric properties of the first resilience measure using stakeholder engagement to define the construct as well as modern psychometric methods, including item response theory (IRT). The UWRS has significant potential to advance both practice and research through its range of uses. It offers flexibility to use computerized adaptive testing or short forms, reducing respondent burden. It is suitable for assessing resilience in the general population as well as people with chronic health conditions or disability. The UWRS is also freely available, which facilitates its use in both research and clinical practice. Use of this psychometrically sound, person-centered, brief, flexible, and free resilience instrument will facilitate observational and intervention research, as well as research comparing resilience across populations and studies.

AB  - Emotion regulation (ER) plays a vital role in individuals<e2><80><99> well-being and successful functioning. In this study, we attempted to develop a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to efficiently evaluate ER, namely the CAT-ER. The initial CAT-ER item bank comprised 154 items from six commonly used ER scales, which were completed by 887 participants recruited in China. We conducted unidimensionality testing, item response theory (IRT) model comparison and selection, and IRT item analysis including local independence, item fit, differential item functioning, and item discrimination. Sixty-three items with good psychometric properties were retained in the final CAT-ER. Then, two CAT simulation studies were implemented to assess the CAT-ER, which revealed that the CAT-ER developed in this study performed reasonably well, considering that it greatly lessened the test items and time without losing measurement accuracy.

AB  - AIM: The Pennsylvania first episode psychosis program evaluation (PA-FEP-PE) core assessment battery was developed as a standard and comprehensive clinical assessment and data collection tool in Pennsylvania coordinated specialty care programs (CSC). To reduce administrative time and maximize clinical utility by maintaining acceptable levels of precision, we aimed to generate a short form using item response theory (IRT)-based computer-adaptive test (CAT) simulation and analyse the implementation and acceptability of the short form among providers from PA-CSC. METHODS: FEP participants (n = 759; age 14-36) from nine coordinated specialty care programs completed 156 items drawn from the PA-FEP-PE battery. Multidimensional IRT-based CAT simulations were used to select the best PA-FEP-PE items for abbreviated forms. RESULTS: A 67-item PA-FEP-PE short form was developed to capture six factors: (1) positive affect and surgency (with negative loadings on Anxious-Misery items); (2) psychiatric services satisfaction; (3) antipsychotic side effect severity; (4) family turmoil and associated traumas; (5) trauma load; and (6) psychosis. The total number of items was reduced more than 50% in the PA-FEP-PE shortened forms. The short form demonstrated good psychometric properties, and it was well accepted by our providers in the implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical derivation and implementation of abbreviated measures of key domains and constructs in FEP care have streamlined and facilitated PA-FEP program evaluation. Our work supports potential application of IRT based methods to empirically reduce core assessment battery measures in large-scale data collection efforts such as in the Early Psychosis Intervention Network.

AB  - Objective: The authors developed a computerized adaptive test for anxiety that decreases patient and clinician burden and increases measurement precision. Method: A total of 1,614 individuals with and without generalized anxiety disorder from a psychiatric clinic and community mental health center were recruited. The focus of the present study was the development of the Computerized Adaptive Testing<e2><80><93>Anxiety Inventory (CAT-ANX). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was used to obtain diagnostic classifications of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Results: An average of 12 items per subject was required to achieve a 0.3 standard error in the anxiety severity estimate and maintain a correlation of 0.94 with the total 431-item test score. CAT-ANX scores were strongly related to the probability of a generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis. Using both the Computerized Adaptive Testing<e2><80><93>- Depression Inventory and the CAT-ANX, comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder can be accurately predicted. Conclusions: Traditional measurement fixes the number of items but allows measurement uncertainty to vary. Computerized adaptive testing fixes measurement uncertainty and allows the number and content of items to vary, leading to a dramatic decrease in the number of items required for a fixed level of measurement uncertainty. Potential applications for inexpensive, efficient, and accurate screening of anxiety in primary care settings, clinical trials, psychiatric epidemiology, molecular genetics, children, and other cultures are discussed.

AB  - Approximately one-fourth of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases are associated with a disruptive genetic variant. Many of these ASD genotypes have been described previously, and are characterized by unique constellations of medical, psychiatric, developmental, and behavioral features. Development of precision medicine care for affected individuals has been challenging due to the phenotypic heterogeneity that exists even within each genetic subtype. In the present study, we identify developmental milestones that predict cognitive and adaptive outcomes for five of the most common ASD genotypes. Sixty-five youth with a known pathogenic variant involving ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A genes participated in cognitive and adaptive testing. Exploratory linear regressions were used to identify developmental milestones that predicted cognitive and adaptive outcomes within each gene group. We hypothesized that the earliest and most predictive milestones would vary across gene groups, but would be consistent across outcomes within each genetic subtype. Within the ADNP group, age of walking predicted cognitive outcomes, while age of first words predicted adaptive behaviors. Age of phrases predicted adaptive functioning in the CHD8 group, but cognitive outcomes were not clearly associated with early developmental milestones. Verbal milestones were the strongest predictors of cognitive and adaptive outcomes for individuals with mutations to DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A. These trends inform decisions about treatment planning and long-term expectations for affected individuals, and they add to the growing body of research linking molecular genetic function to brain development and phenotypic outcomes. LAY SUMMARY: Researchers have found many genetic causes of autism including mutations to ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, and SCN2A genes. We found that each genetic cause had different early developmental milestones that explained the overall functioning of the children when they were older. Depending on the genetic cause, the age that a child first starts walking and/or talking may help to better understand and support a child's development who has a mutation to one of the above genes.

AB  - In recent years, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has been widely used in educational and clinical settings. The basic idea of CAT is relatively straightforward. A computer is used to administer items tailored for individuals to maximize the measurement precision of their proficiency estimates. However, the administration of CAT is not so simple. Those who administer CATs must, while trying to optimize an item selection criterion, consider a variety of practical issues such as test security, content balancing, the purpose of testing, and other test specifications. Such extraneous factors make it possible that a CAT might have so many constraints that in practice it is barely adaptive at all. This concern is at the forefront of the current study, which poses two key questions: How adaptive is a highly adaptive test really? How can the level of adaptation be improved? This study aims to develop three new statistical indicators to measure the amount of adaptation conditional on the examinees' proficiency levels in CAT. It also aims to evaluate the feasibility and utility of these adaptation measures in helping to diagnose and improve adaptivity that occurs during the CAT administration. Extending work done by Reckase, Ju, and Kim (2018), the proposed measures are based on three components<e2><80><94>the differences in the locations between the selected items and the examinee's current proficiency estimates, the variations in the item locations administered to each examinee, and the magnitude of information that the test presents to each examinee. Hence, they can be used to assess adaptivity during the CAT process, as well as to identify differences in the level of adaptation for individuals or subgroups of examinees. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptation indices, this study conducted analyses of real operational testing data from a healthcare licensure examination, as well as comprehensive simulation studies under various conditions that affect adaptivity in a CAT. The key findings of the study suggest that the proposed adaptation indices are likely to function as intended to sensitively detect the magnitude of adaptivity for a CAT over the proficiency continuum. These new measures shed light on how much adaptation of a given test occurs across individual proficiency levels or subpopulations. With some guidelines for the interpretation of these measures recommended in this study, the adaptation indices can also readily serve as diagnostic tools in practice for helping test practitioners design item pools and adaptive tests that support high adaptivity.

AB  - Self-adapted testing has been described as a variation of computerized adaptive testing that reduces test anxiety and thereby enhances test performance. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of these proposed effects of self-adapted tests (SATs); meta-analysis procedures were used to estimate differences between SATs and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in proficiency estimates and post-test anxiety levels across studies in which these two types of tests have been compared. After controlling for measurement error the results showed that SATs yielded proficiency estimates that were 0.12 standard deviation units higher and post-test anxiety levels that were 0.19 standard deviation units lower than those yielded by CATs. The authors speculate about possible reasons for these differences and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using SATs in operational settings.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the association between characteristics of persons with traumatic brain injury (PwTBI) and perceived sleep-related impairment of the caregivers. Method: Fifty-two dyads (n = 23 civilians, n = 29 service members/veterans [SMVs]) were enrolled. Caregivers completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep-Related Impairment computer adaptive test, and PwTBI completed Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders measures of depression, anxiety, anger, cognitive functioning, and upper and lower extremity functioning. Hierarchical linear regression models, stratified by civilian/SMV group, were employed to assess prediction of caregiver-perceived sleep-related impairment from emotional distress of the PwTBI (anxiety, depressed mood, and anger) and perceived functional status of the PwTBI (cognitive, upper extremity, lower extremity functioning). Results: Compared with caregivers of civilians, caregivers of SMVs reported higher perceived sleep-related impairment. Regression results showed that characteristics of the PwTBI accounted for moderate amounts of variance in the sleep-related impairment of caregivers of both civilians and SMVs. Within-group analyses showed that the strongest predictor of sleep-related impairment of caregivers of civilians was self-reported cognitive function of the PwTBI (<ce><b2> = <e2><88><92>0.82, p = .08); the strongest predictor of sleep-related impairment of caregivers of SMVs was self-reported anger of the PwTBI (<ce><b2> = 0.54, p = .07). Conclusions: In both caregivers of civilians and SMVs with TBI, characteristics of the PwTBI were related to perceived caregiver sleep-related impairment. These preliminary data can inform future research with larger samples that examine the impact of multiple characteristics of the caregiver and care recipient on caregiver sleep. Findings highlight the potential importance of considering the dynamics of the dyad in rehabilitation programming not only for the PwTBI but for caregivers as well. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact and Implications: Characteristics of care recipients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have a substantial impact on caregiver sleep. Successful interventions to improve sleep in caregivers may need to address factors that are specific to the caregiver (e.g., emotional distress, health behaviors) as well as specific to the care recipient with TBI (e.g., functional limitations, emotional distress).

AB  - To efficiently obtain information about both the general abilities and detailed cognitive profiles of examinees from a single model that uses a single-calibration process, higher-order cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) that employ higher-order cognitive diagnostic models have been developed. However, the current item selection methods used in higher-order CD-CAT adaptively select items according to only the attribute profiles, which might lead to low precision regarding general abilities; hence, an appropriate method was proposed for this CAT system in this study. Under the framework of the higher-order models, the responses were affected by attribute profiles, which were governed by general abilities. It is reasonable to hold that the item responses were affected by a combination of general abilities and attribute profiles. Based on the logic of Shannon entropy and the generalized deterministic, inputs, noisy 'and' gate (G-DINA) model discrimination index (GDI), two new item selection methods were proposed for higher-order CD-CAT by considering the above combination in this study. The simulation results demonstrated that the new methods achieved more accurate estimations of both general abilities and cognitive profiles than the existing methods and maintained distinct advantages in terms of item pool usage.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R))) is a new, state-of-the-art assessment system for measuring patient-reported health and well-being of adults and children. It has the potential to be more valid, reliable, and responsive than existing PROMs. The items banks are designed to be self-reported and completed by children aged 8-18 years. The PROMIS items can be administered in short forms or through computerized adaptive testing. This paper describes the translation and cultural adaption of nine PROMIS item banks (151 items) for children in Dutch-Flemish. METHODS: The translation was performed by FACITtrans using standardized PROMIS methodology and approved by the PROMIS Statistical Center. The translation included four forward translations, two back-translations, three independent reviews (at least two Dutch, one Flemish), and pretesting in 24 children from the Netherlands and Flanders. RESULTS: For some items, it was necessary to have separate translations for Dutch and Flemish: physical function-mobility (three items), anger (one item), pain interference (two items), and asthma impact (one item). Challenges faced in the translation process included scarcity or overabundance of possible translations, unclear item descriptions, constructs broader/smaller in the target language, difficulties in rank ordering items, differences in unit of measurement, irrelevant items, or differences in performance of activities. By addressing these challenges, acceptable translations were obtained for all items. CONCLUSION: The Dutch-Flemish PROMIS items are linguistically equivalent to the original USA version. Short forms are now available for use, and entire item banks are ready for cross-cultural validation in the Netherlands and Flanders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the ecological validity and clinical utility of NIH Patient Reported-Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) instruments for anger, depression, and fatigue in women with premenstrual symptoms. METHODS: One-hundred women completed daily diaries and weekly PROMIS assessments over 4weeks. Weekly assessments were administered through Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). Weekly CATs and corresponding daily scores were compared to evaluate ecological validity. To test clinical utility, we examined if CATs could detect changes in symptom levels, if these changes mirrored those obtained from daily scores, and if CATs could identify clinically meaningful premenstrual symptom change. RESULTS: PROMIS CAT scores were higher in the pre-menstrual than the baseline (ps<.0001) and post-menstrual (ps<.0001) weeks. The correlations between CATs and aggregated daily scores ranged from .73 to .88 supporting ecological validity. Mean CAT scores showed systematic changes in accordance with the menstrual cycle and the magnitudes of the changes were similar to those obtained from the daily scores. Finally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses demonstrated the ability of the CATs to discriminate between women with and without clinically meaningful premenstrual symptom change. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CAT instruments for anger, depression, and fatigue demonstrated validity and utility in premenstrual symptom assessment. The results provide encouraging initial evidence of the utility of PROMIS instruments for the measurement of affective premenstrual symptoms.

AB  - This study focused on how early misfit affected the recovery of <ce><b8> for a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Number of misfitting items, generating <ce><b8>, item selection method, and <ce><b8> estimation method were independent variables in this study. It was found that CAT could recover from misfit-as-correct-responses for low ability simulees given a sufficient number of items. CAT could not recover from misfit-as-incorrect-responses for high ability simulees. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research were provided.

AB  - Item banks are typically constructed from responses to items that are presented in one fixed order; therefore, order effects between subsequent items may violate the independence assumption. We investigated the effect of item order on item bank construction, item calibration, and ability estimation. 15 polytomous items similar to items used in a pilot version of a computer adaptive test for anxiety (Walter et al., 2005; Walter et al., 2007) were presented in one fixed order or in a order randomly generated for each respondent. A total of n = 520 out-patients participated in the study. Item calibration (Generalized Partial Credit Model) yielded only small differences of slope and location parameters. Simulated test runs using either the full item bank or an adaptive algorithm produced very similar ability estimates (expected a posteriori estimation). These results indicate that item order had little impact on item calibration and ability estimation for this item set. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 45 undergraduates who scored 18 or above on the Test Anxiety Scale took part in a program designed to reduce test-taking anxiety. Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 conditions: standard covert reinforcement; covert rehearsal, which was similar to covert reinforcement except that the reinforcing scene was eliminated; information control, which involved discussion of adaptive test-taking strategies; attention placebo, which included discussion of early childhood evaluative experiences; and delayed treatment, in which Ss were offered treatment following posttreatment assessment. Prior to the inception of treatment, all Ss were given the Wonderlic Personnel Test and the State Anxiety Questionnaire; this procedure was repeated following treatment termination. Ss who received covert rehearsal reported less anxiety than Ss in other conditions. Results are inconclusive on the remaining dependent measures. An alternative conception to the operant model of the effective components of covert reinforcement is presented. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Undergraduates participated in 3 experiments related to self-adapted testing. Experiment 1 demonstrated that, in comparison with computerized adaptive testing, self-adapted testing reduced the influence of anxiety on performance but took longer and was less efficient. Experiment 2 indicated that benefits of self-adapted testing cannot be attributed solely to item ordering. Instead, active choice of item difficulty seems to be necessary. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the provision of feedback increased the efficiency of the test but had no effect on estimates of ability derived. The potential of self-adapted testing to reduce the influence of extraneous sources of variation in test performance is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

Two samples totaling 175 8th graders were tested. The procedure worked well for most Ss but not for those who were exposed to a different conceptual framework of instruction prior to the PLATO instructional lesson. Differences in prior and subsequent instructional methods affected the learning of more advanced materials and produced lower achievement scores on the posttest given at the end of the program.

AB  - Since the early work on Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), a positive effect of CAT on participants<e2><80><99> test taking motivation has been widely accepted. However, in recent publications this assumption is frequently criticized and a negative effect is stated. To bring light to the controversy, the effect of adaptive testing with the Frankfurt Adaptive Concentration Test (FACT, Moosbrugger & Heyden, 1997) on test-taking motivation was examined experimentally (N = 79). Two independent samples received the FACT either in an adaptive or a non-adaptive version. Test-taking motivation was significantly lower in the adaptive condition than in the non-adaptive condition, p = .045, <ce><b7><c2><b2> = .051. Further analyses showed that the differences in test-taking motivation between the adaptive und the non-adaptive condition are mainly due to the perceived probability of success and not to other motivational components like the perceived probability of failure or the perceived challenge.

AB  - In recent years, the multistage adaptive test (MST) has gained increasing popularity in the field of educational measurement and operational testing. MST refers to a test in which pre-constructed sets of items are administered adaptively and are scored as a unit (Hendrickson, 2007). As a special case of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), a MST program needs the following components: an item response theory (IRT) model or non-IRT-based alternatives; an item pool design; module assembly; ability estimation; routing algorithm; and scoring (Yan et al., 2014). A significant amount of research has been conducted on components like module assembly, ability estimation, routing and scoring, but few studies have addressed the component of item pool design. An item pool is defined as consisting of a maximal number of combinations of items that meet all content specifications for a test and provide sufficient item information for estimation at a series of ability levels (van der Linden et al., 2006). An item pool design is very important because any successful MST assembly is inseparable from an optimal item pool that provides sufficient and high-quality items (Luecht & Nungester, 1998). Reckase (2003, 2010) developed the p-optimality method to design optimal item pools using the unidimensional Rasch model in CAT, and it has been proved to be efficient for different item types and IRT models. The present study extended this method to MST context in supporting and developing different MST panel designs under different test configurations. The study compared the performance of the MST assembled under the most popularly studied panel designs in the literature, such as 1-2, 1-3, 1-2-2, and 1-2-3. A combination of short, medium and long tests with different routing test proportions were used to build up different tests. Using one of the most popularly investigated IRT models, the Rasch model, simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 optimal items pools were generated and the measurement accuracy was evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. The p-optimality method was also applied in an operational MST licensure test to see if it is feasible in supporting test assembly and achieving sufficient measurement accuracy in practice. Results showed that the different MST panel designs achieved sufficient measurement accuracy by using the items from the optimal item pools built with the p-optimality method. The same was true with the operational item pool. Measurement accuracy was related to test length, but not so much to the routing test proportions. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but the distributions of the item parameters and item pool characteristics for all the MST panel designs were similar under the two conditions. The item pool sizes under the exposure control conditions were several times larger than those under no exposure control, depending on the types of MST panel designs and routing test proportions. The results from this study provide information for how to enhance item pool utilization when designing multistage computerized adaptive tests, facilitating the MST assembly process, and improving the scoring accuracy.

AB  - Psychological constructs are usually assessed by instruments based on classical test theory (CTT). Since the sixties, item response theory (IRT) offers a promising alternative to these traditional ways of test construction. On the basis of IRT computerized adaptive tests (CATs) can be developed that select items from an item bank according to previous responses of the patients. These individually tailored tests promise to maximize the measurement precision and require fewer items than conventional questionnaires. We constructed a CAT for anxiety to examine whether the theoretical advantages materialize in a practical application. Data of N=2,348 patients were collected at the Department of Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, Charit<c3><a9> University Medicine Berlin. As part of the diagnostic routines a broad set of established questionnaires was answered. Out of these questionnaires, 81 items with relevance to anxiety were selected in a Delphi process. The properties of these items were examined by confirmatory factor analysis with analysis of residual correlations (MplusTM, evaluation of item response curves (TestgrafTM), and computation of discrimination parameters (ParscaleTM). Fifty items remained in the item pool after the selection process. Item parameters were estimated according to the Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM). Simulation studies show that anxiety can be estimated with approx. 7 items (standard error of <e2><89><a4>.32, corresponding to a reliability level of p <e2><89><a5>.90). Furthermore, our simulation studies indicate that the CAT algorithm has higher discriminative power for patients at high and low levels of anxiety compared to a conventional CCT based sum score (STAI state scale).

AB  - Anchorâ€ and distributionâ€based methods were combined to evaluate and establish minimally important differences (MIDs) for two Patientâ€Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures in an outpatient chronic pain population. These included the computerâ€adaptive test (CAT) versions of two PROMIS measures: Depressive Symptoms and Anxietyâ€Related Symptoms (PROMIS; Cella, Gershon, Lai & Choi). Participants (n = 170) undergoing a behavioral medicine evaluation in an interdisciplinary pain management clinic completed two PROMIS CATs and multiple clinical anchor measures/questions. Modeled after similar analyses (Yost, Eton, Garcia, & Cella), three a priori criteria were used to select usable crossâ€sectional anchorâ€based MID estimates; these included a minimum Spearman correlation of .3 between the PROMIS measure and anchor item/categories, a minimum comparison group sample size of 10 within each anchor, and an effect size between .2 and .8 for each anchorâ€based estimate. For each PROMIS measure, the mean standard error of measurement was calculated and incorporated into MID analyses. Using a large sample (n = 170), a number of the crossâ€sectional Tâ€score anchorâ€based MID estimates (57%) were not included due to failure to meet a priori criteria. Based on the analyses, the following Tâ€score MID ranges are recommended: Depression CAT (3.5â€“5.5) and Anxiety CAT (3.0â€“5.5). The average effect sizes for MID estimates ranged from .32 to .57. This study is among the first to address MIDs for PROMIS measures; it is the first study to establish usable MIDs for psychological symptoms on outpatients with chronic/persistent pain. The results may be used to gauge minimally important clinical difference and/or treatment response for individuals within this patient population. MIDs for PROs are particularly useful when treatment responses are significant to the patient but are difficult to evaluate during the clinical visit.

AB  - In recent decades, computerized multistage testing (MST) has been utilized as an alternative testing mode for large-scale testing programs. Although the usage of MST has been discussed extensively, there is little literature that addresses its psychometric properties. The motivation of this dissertation arises from the need to properly estimate psychometric properties under the MST framework. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrated set of formulas for estimating psychometric properties for MST, including error variance, reliability, and classification indices. To achieve this goal, existing methods that are used for the traditional P\\&P tests are extended to the MST context, if possible; and new methods are proposed based on the characteristics of MST (i.e., routing probability) for the ML and EAP estimators. For the ML estimator, a conventional approach to computing MST test information analytically is also included for estimating the psychometric properties. The proposed approach and the conventional approach are then applied to a single set of MST data, with varied conditions. Further, a simulation approach is employed for the purpose of understanding and comparing the performance of the proposed approach and conventional approach. In the simulation approach, replications of test data are used to obtain results.The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) for the ML estimator, the proposed analytic approach performed better than the conventional approach, indicated by comparing their results with those from the simulation approach; (2) for the EAP estimator, results from using the Bayesian approach approach led to smaller values of marginal error variances and higher values of reliability, compared with the quadrature approach; (3) longer test resulted in decreased error variances and improved reliability; (4) for the EAP Bayesian approach, increasing sample size had a limited impact on the estimation results; (5) for all the approaches, conditional classification consistency and accuracy gradually decreased when the ability parameter was moving further away from the cut scores. All of the estimation formulas provided in this dissertation can be applied directly to MST data in practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A comprehensive psychological evaluation is distinguished by a process that takes in consideration the history and clinical observations in a meaningful and contextual way in order to identify the most appropriate instruments and thus carry out a comprehensive analysis of the scores, facilitating an accurate diagnostic impression. We present a case study comparing and analyzing data from two psychological evaluations carried out at the age of 7 years and 3 months and, at 9 years and 3 months, in a child with a subarachnoid cyst affecting the frontal, temporal, and right parietal lobes. As a result of the brain injury, the child exhibited changes in emotional modulation, executive functioning, and learning. As part of the comprehensive evaluation, the following assessment protocol was used: developmental history, previous psychological evaluations, results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, tests of verbal and non-verbal intelligence, achievement tests, neuropsychological and adaptive tests. The results obtained highlight positive changes in the child when comparing the two times under consideration. The comprehensive approach allowed analyzing the child's functioning in different areas and offering a differential diagnosis, considering the brain injury, and adjusting the therapeutic and academic recommendations.

AB  - In recent years, many computerized test systems have been developed for diagnosing students<e2><80><99> learning profiles. Nevertheless, it remains a challenging issue to find an adaptive testing algorithm to both shorten testing time and precisely diagnose the knowledge status of students. In order to find a suitable algorithm, four adaptive testing algorithms, based on ordering theory, item relational structure theory, Diagnosys, and domain experts, were evaluated based on the training sample size, prediction accuracy, and the use of test items by the simulation study with paper-based test data. Based on the results of simulation study, ordering theory has the best performance. An ordering-theory-based knowledge-structure-adaptive testing system was developed and evaluated. The results of this system showed that the two different interfaces, paper-based and computer-based, did not affect the examinees<e2><80><99> performance. In addition, the effect of correct guessing was discussed, and two methods with adaptive testing algorithms were proposed to mitigate this effect. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods improve the effect of correct guessing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computer-based testing is becoming popular with credentialing agencies because new test designs are possible and the evidence is clear that these new designs can increase the reliability and validity of candidate scores and pass/fail decisions. Research on MST to date suggests that the measurement quality of MST results is comparable to full-fledged computer-adaptive tests and improved over computerized fixed-form tests. MST's promise dwells in this potential for improved measurement with greater control than other adaptive approaches for constructing test forms. Recommending use of the MST design and advising how best to set up the design, however, are two different things. The purpose of the current simulation study was to advance an established line of research on MST methodology by enhancing understanding of how several important design variables affect outcomes for high-stakes credentialing. Modeling of the item bank, the candidate population, and the statistical characteristics of test items reflect an operational credentialing exam's conditions. Studied variables were module arrangement (4 designs), amount of overall test information (4 levels), distribution of information over stages (2 variations), strategies for between-stage routing (4 levels), and pass rates (3 levels), for 384 conditions total. Results showed that high levels of decision accuracy (DA) and decision consistency (DC) were consistently observed, even when test information was reduced by as much as 25%. No differences due to the choice of module arrangement were found. With high overall test information, results were optimal when test information was divided equally among stages; with reduced test information gathering more test information at Stage 1 provided the best results. Generalizing simulation study findings is always problematic. In practice, psychometric models never completely explain candidate performance, and with MST, there is always the potential psychological impact on candidates if test difficulty shifts are noticed. At the same time, two findings seem to stand out in this research: (1) with limited amounts of overall test information, it may be best to capitalize on available information with accurate branching decisions early, and (2) there may be little statistical advantage in exceeding test information much above 10 as gains in reliability and validity appear minimal.

AB  - In the past, a German Computerized Adaptive Test, based on Item Response Theory (IRT), was developed for purposes of assessing the construct depression [Computer-adaptive test for depression (D-CAT)]. This study aims at testing the feasibility and validity of the real computer-adaptive application. The D-CAT, supplied by a bank of 64 items, was administered on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a predetermined reliability (r <e2><89><a5> 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)]. The D-CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds), well accepted by the patients and reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95% of the cases, 10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between the D-CAT and the HADS, CES-D, and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The D-CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established questionnaires do. The D-CAT proved an efficient, well accepted and reliable tool. Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures, whereby the CAT is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item selection for content in the future.

AB  - Background: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) based on Item Response Theory, (IRT) offers an efficient way for accurate measurement of patient reported outcomes. The efficiency lies within a minimal response burden and a high measurement precision over a broad measurement range. The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the responsiveness of CATs measuring anxiety, depression, and stress reaction to standard static self-assessment tools. Methods: Longitudinal data of n = 595 psychosomatic inpatients were analyzed for evaluating retest-reliability and sensitivity to change of the CATs compared to static measures (GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PSQ) using correlational and ANOVA statistics. The study hypothesized that CATs are at least as retest-reliable and as sensitive to change as static tools. Results: The three CATs show a low burden for patients, administering on average 5<e2><80><93>7 (<c2><b1>2<e2><80><93>6SD) items with similar retest-reliability compared to the static tools applied (A-CAT: r = .78 vs. GAD-7: r = .75, D-CAT: r = .71 vs. PHQ-9: r = .75, S-CAT: r = .80 vs. PSQ worries scale: r = .80). The CATs were overall as sensitive to change as the static tools (Cohen's d ranged between .19 and .69). Limitations: This is a monocenter, observational, longitudinal study without external clinical criteria; thus generalization to other settings may be limited. Conclusions: The tested CATs belong to the first generation of CATs being used in daily routine for more than a decade. They are as retest reliable and sensitive to change as static tools. Newer CATs may provide further practical advantages. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used measure of perceived stress; however, minimal psychometric evaluation has been performed among Hispanic respondents, and even less among Hispanic caregivers to persons with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRDs). DESIGN: Secondary data analysis. SETTING: New York City, NY, USA. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 453 community dwelling Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. MEASUREMENTS: Latent variable models were used to evaluate the PSS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine unidimensionality. Differential item functioning (DIF) was examined for age, education, and language using the graded item response model. RESULTS: The factor and bifactor analyses results supported essential unidimensionality of the item set; however, positively worded items were observed using response item theory to be less informative than the negatively worded items. Reliability estimates were high. Salient DIF was not observed for age, education, or language of interview using the primary DIF detection method. Sensitivity analyses using a second DIF detection method identified uniform language-DIF for the item, "In the last month, how often have you felt that you were on top of things?" However, the non-compensatory DIF value was below the threshold considered salient. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the 10-item PSS performed well in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. Very little DIF, and none of high magnitude and impact, was observed. However, the negatively worded items, perhaps because they are more directly reflective of stress, were more informative. In the context of a short-form measure or computerized adaptive test, more informative items are those that would be selected for inclusion.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory<e2><80><93>2 Restructured Form (MMPI<e2><80><93>2<e2><80><93>RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder<e2><80><93>Static Form (CAT<e2><80><93>PD<e2><80><93>SF; Simms et al., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI<e2><80><93>2<e2><80><93>RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT<e2><80><93>PD<e2><80><93>SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial (<e2><89><a5> |.30|) correlations. The MMPI<e2><80><93>2<e2><80><93>RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT<e2><80><93>PD<e2><80><93>SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - COVID-19 prompted distress and increased reliance on digital mental health interventions, which previously demonstrated low rates of retention and adherence. This single-arm trial evaluated whether self-guided, web-based, positive affect regulation skills (PARK) were engaging and associated with changes in well-being during the pandemic. Over 6 weeks, PARK delivers brief lessons and practices in skills designed to increase positive emotions: noticing positive events, savoring, gratitude, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, and self-compassion. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests of anxiety, depression, social isolation, positive affect, and meaning and purpose were administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months after baseline. Retention and usage of PARK were measured by the web-based assessment and intervention platforms. The sample (n = 616) was predominantly female, non-Hispanic, white, and well-educated. Of those who completed baseline, only 42% completed a follow-up assessment; 30% never logged into PARK. Among those who did, 86% used at least one skill, but only 14% completed PARK. Across retention and usage metrics, older age predicted more engagement. In multivariable models, people of color and people with greater baseline anxiety were more likely to complete PARK. All well-being indicators improved over time, with greater improvements in anxiety and social isolation among participants who accessed at least one PARK skill compared to those who did not. Retention and usage rates mirrored pre-pandemic trends, but within this select sample, predictors of engagement differed from prior research. Findings underscore the need for additional efforts to ensure equitable access to digital mental health interventions and research. Trials registration: NCT04367922.

AB  - Comparing to the nonadaptive testing, the major advantage of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is that the examinees achieve the same degree of measurement precision (i.e., fixed precision). But few studies are devoted to the termination rules in variable-length cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT). Inspired by the termination rule research in traditional CAT, this paper proposed four termination rules for variable-length CD-CAT. The new termination rules were standard error of attribute method (SEA), difference of the adjacent posterior probability method (DAPP), halving algorithm (HA) and hybrid method (HM), respectively. Then, the four new termination rules were compared with the HSU and KL method under two scenarios: with and without item exposure control. Three exposure control methods were considered, i.e., simple, modified restrictive progressive (MRP) and modified restrictive threshold (MRT) method. The MRP and MRT methods were extension of the Wang et al.'s (2011) work to the variable-length CD-CAT scenario. The results indicated that: (1) When the criterion of variable-length termination rule was conservative, the mean of the test length and the percentage of examinees reaching the maximum test length were large, and the classification accuracy rate for examinees who finished the CAT using fixed precision was high. (2) Without the item exposure control, the four new variable-length termination rules had a similar performance compared to the HSU method. With the increase of maximum posterior probability and the decrease of <c2><a3>, the classification accuracy rate and the mean test length presented a increasing trend. But the item pool usage was unsatisfactory. (3) With the item exposure control, item pool usage was greatly improved in the six variable-length termination rules while the classification accuracy rates were maintained. Different exposure control methods had a different effect on the different variable-length termination rules. The relative criterion termination rules such as DAPP and KL methods were easily affected by the item exposure control. (4) Taken all together, the SEA, HM, and HA methods were comparable to the HSU method, and followed by the KL and DAPP method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: We describe a three-phase implementation of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Depression and Anxiety Standard Set in a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry practice. Methods: During the preintervention phase, we reviewed patient-reported outcome tools and engaged stakeholders and leadership. During phase 1, the standard set was converted into an electronic previsit intake assessment that was implemented in a physician champion's practice. Patients completed the intake on a tablet, and computer adaptive testing was used to reduce response burden. Physician-facing data display facilitated use during subsequent in-person visits. An electronic version of the follow-up standard set was used during follow-up visits. During phase 2, a second physician tested scalability and the intervention was disseminated department wide in phase 3. Results: During phase 1, 186 intakes and 67 follow-up electronic patient-reported outcome sets were completed. Average patient age was 54 years, and 44% were male. On average, patients ranked the tool 4.4 out of 5 and spent 22 minutes completing the intake. Time-driven activity-based costing found the new process to be cost-effective. During phase 2, 386 patients completed electronic patient-reported outcome sets, with 315 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the tool as 4.0 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes completing the questions. During phase 3, 2166 patients completed intake electronic patient-reported outcome sets and 1249 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the tool 4.3 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes on it. Scores and completion time did not differ greatly between phases. Conclusions: Integration of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Depression and Anxiety Standard Set is feasible. Future research comparing International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement set with other approaches and in different settings is needed.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to shed new light on the inconsistent relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining feedback type as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by feedback type. Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and feedback type also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used in a wide range of human resource and performance management instruments (e.g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/360<c2><b0> feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees<e2><80><99> reactions and rate of performance improvement.

AB  - This article discusses 3 modern forced-choice personality tests developed for the U.S Armed Services to provide resistance to faking and other forms of response distortion: the Assessment of Individual Motivation, the Navy Computerized Adaptive Personality Scales, and the Tailored Adaptive Personality Assessment System. These tests represent the transition from Likert to forced-choice formats and from static to computerized adaptive item selection to meet the challenges of large-scale, high-stakes testing environments. For each test, we briefly describe the personality constructs that are assessed, the response format and scoring methods, and selected ongoing research and development efforts. We also highlight the potential of these tests for personnel selection, classification, and diagnostic screening purposes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Decline in cognitive ability is a core diagnostic criterion for dementia. Knowing the extent of decline requires a baseline score from which change can be reckoned. In the absence of prior cognitive ability scores, vocabulary-based cognitive tests are used to estimate premorbid cognitive ability. It is important that such tests are short yet informative, to maximize information and practicability. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) is commonly used to estimate premorbid intelligence. People are asked to pronounce 50 words ranging from easy to difficult but whether its words conform to a hierarchy is unknown. Five hundred eighty-seven healthy community-dwelling older people with known age 11 IQ scores completed the NART as part of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study. Mokken analysis was used to explore item responses for unidimensional, ordinal, and hierarchical scales. A strong hierarchical scale ('mini-NART') of 23 of the 50 items was identified. These items are invariantly ordered across all ability levels. The validity of the interpretation of this briefer scale<e2><80><99>s score as an estimate of premorbid ability was examined using the actual age 11 IQ score. The mini-NART accounted for a similar amount of the variance in age 11 IQ as the full NART (NART = 46.5%, mini-NART = 44.8%). The mini-NART is proposed as a useful short clinical tool to estimate prior cognitive ability. The mini-NART has clinical relevance, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items allowing for sensitive measurement, and adaptive testing, reducing test administration time, and patient stress.

AB  - Purpose: To be patient-centered, assessment must extract what patients prefer to be able to do along with what they can do now so health care can specifically address the gap between current and preferred abilities. In this project, we compared patient-perceived current<e2><80><93>preferred gaps with the assessments and interventions reported by clinicians in a rehabilitation clinic. Methods: Sixty-two patients in outpatient physical therapy completed a computer-adaptive test version of the patient-reported Movement Ability Measure (MAM-CAT) at initial visit and discharge. The MAM-CAT calculated the gaps between the movement patients perceived that they could do 'Now' and what movement ability they 'Would Like' to have across six dimensions of movement: flexibility, strength, accuracy, speed, adaptability, and endurance. Physical therapists<e2><80><99> notes regarding assessments and interventions were categorized based on these same six dimensions of movement. Frequency of agreement between the largest patient-perceived gaps and clinician-documented emphases was recorded (kappa analyses), along with MAM-CAT changes at discharge (paired t tests).Results: Although patient progress was noted in both the MAM-CAT and the clinician notes (p < .05), comparison showed poor or slight agreement (kappa < .05) between the specific movement dimensions patients regarded as having the largest gaps and the dimensions on which clinicians focused.Conclusion: The MAM-CAT facilitated direct comparison of patients<e2><80><99> current<e2><80><93>preferred gaps at initiation and discharge with clinicians<e2><80><99> emphases during episodes of care. While interventions were perceived as effective, collaboration between patients and clinicians using gap data could increase alignment between patient priorities and clinician emphases, potentially resulting in improved patient engagement and rehabilitative outcomes.

AB  - Existing sets of social and emotional stimuli suitable for social cognition research are limited in many ways, including size, unimodal stimulus delivery, and restriction to major universal emotions. Existing measures of social cognition could be improved by taking advantage of item response theory and adaptive testing technology to develop instruments that obtain more efficient measures of multimodal social cognition. However, for this to be possible, large pools of emotional stimuli must be obtained and validated. We present the development of a large, high-quality multimedia stimulus set produced by professional adult and child actors (ages 5 to 74) containing both visual and vocal emotional expressions. We obtained over 74,000 audiovisual recordings of a wide array of emotional and social behaviors, including the main universal emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise), as well as more complex social expressions (pride, affection, sarcasm, jealousy, and shame). The actors generated a high quantity of technically superior, ecologically valid stimuli that were digitized, archived, and rated for accuracy and intensity of expressions. A subset of these facial and vocal expressions of emotion and social behavior were submitted for quantitative ratings to generate parameters for validity and discriminability. These stimuli are suitable for affective neuroscience-based psychometric tests, functional neuroimaging, and social cognitive rehabilitation programs. The purposes of this report are to describe the method of obtaining and validating this database and to make it accessible to the scientific community. We invite all those interested in participating in the use and validation of these stimuli to access them at www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/actors/index.shtml .

AB  - We investigated the effects of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) versus computerized fixed item testing (FIT) of reasoning ability on current motivation in terms of situational fear of failure and subjective probability of success, as well as flow. A group of 174 students (aged 15<e2><80><93>21) from two German secondary schools was presented either a CAT or a FIT version of a matrices test; motivational variables were assessed during a short break in testing. More situational fear of failure and less subjective probability of success were reported using CAT compared to FIT. Self-reported flow did not differ between test mode conditions. When we addressed the hypothesis that adaptive testing is equally motivating for both high and lower performers, test performance appeared to moderate the relationship of test mode and subjective probability of success: Only during FIT was subjective probability of success higher with lower test performance. This moderation effect was also revealed for the relationship of test mode and flow. However, as average reported motivation was lower during CAT, results contradict assumptions of enhanced motivation during CAT. Results are discussed in relation to self-concept relevance of testing domains and with reference to test fairness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of CATSIB (Computer Adaptive Testing-Simultaneous Item Bias Test) for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) when items in the matching and studied subtest are administered adaptively in the context of a realistic multi-stage adaptive test (MST). MST was simulated using a 4-item module in a 7-panel administration. Three independent variables, expected to affect DIF detection rates, were manipulated: item difficulty, sample size, and balanced/unbalanced design. CATSIB met the acceptable criteria, meaning that the Type I error and power rates met 5% and 80%, respectively, for the large reference/moderate focal sample and the large reference/large focal sample conditions. These results indicate that CATSIB can be used to consistently and accurately detect DIF on an MST, but only with moderate to large samples.

AB  - PURPOSE: We are developing an age-related macular degeneration (AMD) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) item bank, applicable to Western and Asian populations. We report primarily on content generation and refinement, but also compare the HRQoL issues reported in our study with Western studies and current AMD-HRQoL questionnaires. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, qualitative study of AMD patients attending the Singapore National Eye Centre (May-December 2019), items/domains were generated from: (1) AMD-specific questionnaires; (2) published articles; (3) focus groups/semi-structured interviews with AMD patients (n = 27); and (4) written feedback from retinal experts. Following thematic analysis, items were systematically refined to a minimally representative set and pre-tested using cognitive interviews with 16 AMD patients. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients (mean +/- standard deviation age 67.9 +/- 7.0; 59.2% male), 18 (66.7%), two (7.4%), and seven (25.9%) had no, early-intermediate, and late/advanced AMD (better eye), respectively. Whilst some HRQoL issues, e.g. activity limitation, mobility, lighting, and concerns were similarly reported by Western patients and covered by other questionnaires, others like anxiety about intravitreal injections, work tasks, and financial dependency were novel. Overall, 462 items within seven independent HRQoL domains were identified: Activity limitation, Lighting, Mobility, Emotional, Concerns, AMD management, and Work. Following item refinement, items were reduced to 219, with 31 items undergoing amendment. CONCLUSION: Our 7-domain, 219-item AMD-specific HRQoL instrument will undergo psychometric testing and calibration for computerized adaptive testing. The future instrument will enable users to precisely, rapidly, and comprehensively quantify the HRQoL impact of AMD and associated treatments, with item coverage relevant across several populations.

AB  - This dissertation investigated the impact of item parameter drift (IPD) on examinee ability measures, in the analysis of data generated from a computerized adaptive test (CAT) collected in year 2003 by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in a Medical Technologist (MT) examination. For the 2003 ASCP MT exam, the item bank included 1,270 items. Items were selected from seven subscales: (a) blood banking, (b) chemistry, (c) hematology, (d) immunology, (e) laboratory operations, (f) microbiology, and (g) urinalysis. ASCP administered this CAT to 2,555 examinees. The data were analyzed using a new hierarchical linear model (HLM), called the Rasch longitudinal model (RLM), which models interaction between the item and time, in addition to parameters of examinee ability and item difficulty (easiness). The analysis demonstrated how IPD within the item bank for the ASCP MT exam affected examinee ability measures, and the extent to which IPD altered certification or pass-fail decisions. The RLM identified items that exhibited significant IPD for each subscale and provided the magnitude (and direction) of IPD within the 2003 ASCP MT exam data. No one subscale was more sensitive to IPD than any other. Further, by including significant time effects (IPD), the RLM provided a better fit to the data than the Rasch model as an HLM. The RLM not only determined items exhibiting IPD but also compensated for the existence of IPD within the calculation of examinee abilities by using the drifted item difficulty value versus the anchored one. Consequently, the RLM provided more accurate measures of examinee ability and item difficulty than the Rasch model as analyzed using the WINSTEPS program As a result, using the RLM yielded a more efficient IPD detection method, one that identified items with IPD but also corrected the estimation of examinee abilities for the existence of IPD.

AB  - Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security Administration's (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood & emotions, resilience, social interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition & communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental health subdomains: Cognition & Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 items), Resilience & Sociability (29 items) and Mood & Emotions (34 items). All scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational rehabilitation settings.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is a critical gap in the literature regarding the efficacy of occupational therapy interventions for pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that occupational therapy 4-5x/wk during inpatient hospitalization positively affects strength, coordination, and independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) of pediatric patients during HCT. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient bone marrow transplant unit at a children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two pediatric patients admitted for HCT. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were seen by an occupational therapist as part of an interdisciplinary program. Interventions included play and leisure engagement, upper extremity therapeutic exercises, fine motor activities, and ADL training. Strength, coordination, and daily living skills data were documented prospectively and analyzed retrospectively to compare differences between patients seen by occupational therapy at high versus low frequency. RESULTS: For grip strength (dynamometer), fine motor dexterity (the 9-Hole Peg Test), and independence in ADLs (an ADL functional measure and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test Daily Activities), the high-frequency group had a significantly smaller decrease in performance from time of admission at pretransplant (baseline) to peak decline after transplant. Grip strength and ADL scores for the high-frequency group returned to baseline at time of discharge more readily than for the low-frequency group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Participation in occupational therapy 4-5x/wk had positive effects on strength, coordination, and independence in ADLs for patients undergoing HCT. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: This article provides evidence that occupational therapists are an important part of the interdisciplinary team treating pediatric bone marrow transplant patients. It also demonstrates that occupational therapy interventions delivered at a high frequency can have a positive impact on upper extremity strength and independence in ADLs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to develop and validate a suite of dimensional measures of psychiatric syndromes for use in a criminal justice population. METHODS: The previously validated Computerized Adaptive Test-Mental Health (CAT-MH) was administered to a sample of 475 defendants in the Cook County Bond Court. Item-level data were used to determine which test items exhibited differential item functioning in this population compared with the population used for the original calibration. RESULTS: After removal of nine items that exhibited differential item functioning from the CAT-MH, correlations between scores based on the original calibration from a nonjustice-involved population and the newly computed scores based on a sample of bond court defendants showed a correlation coefficient of r=0.96 to r=0.99. CONCLUSIONS: With a slight modification of the original CAT-MH, the tool was successfully used to measure severity of depression, anxiety, mania and/or hypomania, suicidality, and substance use disorder in an English- and Spanish-speaking criminal justice population.

AB  - Objective: This study outlined the implementation and feasibility of delivering PROMIS<c2><ae> computer adaptive tests (CATs) using a web-based method to evaluate the impact of a technological adaptation of Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) on the psychosocial functioning of men with advanced prostate cancer (APC) undergoing hormone therapy. Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS<c2><ae> computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS<c2><ae> CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS<c2><ae> domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS<c2><ae> anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS<c2><ae> CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

TI  - Investigating hybrid test designs in passage-based adaptive tests

CY  - NA
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) selects each item to match with an examinee's ability level during the test. In contrast, multistage adaptive testing (MST) administers a group of items instead of each individual item adaptively. A hybrid design combines CAT and MST borrowing strengths from both testing modes. However, existing research studies indicate that there is lack of knowledge on hybrid designs in passage-based adaptive testing, including situations where misrouting occurs. Misrouting refers to when examinees get routed to paths that don't match with their true ability levels. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the proposed hybrid designs (HMCAT designs) with respect to ability estimation accuracy under different MST configurations and their performance when misrouting occurs.The HMCAT designs under passage-based adaptive testing control test adaptability at both passage/stimulus level and item level. Four proposed HMCAT designs differ by implementing the item level CAT at different stages of the MST. Specifically, among all four designs, the two most extreme designs are the one implementing CAT across all stages (CC) and the one not implementing CAT across any stage (PP). The two hybrid designs include implementing CAT only in the routing stage (CP) and implementing CAT only in the last stage (PC). The hybrid designs' performance compared to that of the CC design and the PP design when interacting with different MST configurations and when misrouting occurs are the two main research questions of the study. The three-phase simulation analysis indicates that (1) the PC design achieves more accurate final ability estimation results under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (2) although the CP design fails to perform effectively when misrouting occurs under the three-stage MST configuration, it is still able to achieve accurate final ability estimation results under both two-stage MST configurations; (3) the CC design and the PP design achieve similar and the most accurate final ability estimation results under all four MST configurations; (4) the PC design reaches similar accuracy as the CC design and the PP design under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (5) the CP design reaches a similar accuracy level as the CC design and the PP design under both two-stage MST configurations; (6) the CP design is affected the most when misrouting occurs in the three-stage MST configuration, whereas the other three HMCAT designs are not affected. In general, findings from simulation analyses suggest that the HMCAT designs are effective enough to use in passage/stimulus-based adaptive tests with appropriate MST configurations. They also contain advantages such as greater flexibility with respect to content balancing, test security and control on item administration. However, it is important to understand that the performance of HMCAT designs can heavily depend on the MST configuration, the item pool characteristics, the test design and components in the test administration algorithm, such as content balancing strategies. Results from the current study provide implications for practitioners on how to decide on an appropriate HMCAT design under real testing contexts and how to evaluate and maintain the selected HMCAT design to effectively implement the design in practice.

AB  - Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous studies.

AB  - Purpose: Current patient-reported outcomes for female urinary incontinence (UI) are limited by their inability to be tailored. Our objective is to describe the development and field testing of seven item banks designed to measure domains identified as important UI in females (UIf). We also describe the calibration and validation properties of the UIf-item banks, which allow for more efficient computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in the future. Methods: The UIf-measures included 168 items covering seven domains: Stress UI (SUI), overactive bladder (OAB), urinary frequency, physical, social and emotional health impact and adaptation. Items underwent rigorous qualitative development and psychometric testing across two sites. Items were calibrated using item response theory and evaluated for internal consistency, construct validity and responsiveness. Results: A total of 750 women (249 SUI, 249 OAB and 252 mixed UI) participated. Mean age was 55 <c2><b1> 14 years, and 23 % were Hispanic and 80 % white. In addition to face and content validity, the measures demonstrated good internal consistency (coefficient alpha 0.92<e2><80><93>0.98) and unidimensionality. There was evidence for construct validity with moderate-to-strong correlations with the UDI (r<e2><80><99>s <e2><89><a5> 0.6) and IIQ (r<e2><80><99>s = <e2><89><a5>0.6) scales. The measures were responsive to change for SUI treatment (paired t test p < .001, ES range 1.3<e2><80><93>2.9; SRM range 1.3<e2><80><93>2.5) and OAB treatment (paired t test p < .05 for all domains except social health impact and adaptation, ES range 0.3<e2><80><93>1.5, SRM range 0.4<e2><80><93>1.0). The measures were responsive based on concurrent changes with the UDI and IIQ (p < 0.05). CAT versions were developed and pilot-tested. Conclusions: The UIf-item banks demonstrate good psychometric characteristics and are a sufficiently valid set of customizable tools for measuring UI symptoms and life impact.

AB  - The first 60 or so years of psychological, educational, and personnel testing were dominated by the paper-and-pencil (P&P) test. Item banking, test assembly, and test scoring were entirely manual procedures that were labor intensive, tedious, and prone to errors. Tests were highly standardized, as were conditions of administration. Changes began to occur with the introduction of electronic optical mark readers that reduced test scoring to a relatively accurate partially automated procedure that dominated standardized testing for many decades. The introduction of the PC in the mid-1980s, however, began a major evolution of testing away from the traditional way of building tests and delivering them. The years since 1985 have seen computers automate the processes of item banking, test assembly, test analysis, and test delivery. The PC allowed the development of new modes of test delivery<e2><80><94>random, sequential, and adaptive<e2><80><94>and new kinds of test items. The advent of the Internet extended test delivery to any computer that could connect to it, albeit not without some problems. The result of this evolution of testing is a set of processes that are considerably less labor intensive, more accurate, and more efficient. In the process of this ongoing conversion, numerous questions have arisen, some of which have not yet been satisfactorily studied or even addressed. Few research questions surround computerized item banking and test assembly. The major questions have risen in the context of computer-based testing (CBT). In the early days of CBT, it was natural to address the question of whether CBTs functioned the same as P&P tests. Generally, it was found that they did (Mead & Drasgow, 1993), although early research indicated some differences on reading comprehension tests (e.g., Kiely, Zara, & Weiss, 1986; Mazzeo & Harvey, 1988). As CBTs begin to be used to measure constructs that cannot be measured by P&P, however, comparability is no longer an issue, and CBTs will have to be validated on their own merits. Obviously, a host of questions exist about how to best implement computerized adaptive tests (CATs) and sequential tests that have resulted in substantial research over the past 20 or 30 years and will continue to do so. CBTs also raise a number of questions about the psychological environment of testing that have generally not been addressed. In the process of creating a test of appropriate difficulty for each examinee, CATs create a different psychological environment than do P&P tests. Does that difference affect examinee performance? PC-delivered tests have virtually no delays between items in comparison to Internet-delivered tests. Do the unpredictable delays in Internet-based testing affect examinees<e2><80><99> test anxiety and thereby influence test performance? Do the random variations in the testing environment that occur for unsupervised Internet-based testing affect test scores? Finally, as the Internet continues to pervade people<e2><80><99>s activities through various electronic devices, some have suggested that certain kinds of psychological measurements (e.g., attitudes, personality variables) can be delivered by portable electronic devices such as PDAs and cellular phones. If these modes of test delivery are implemented, the usefulness of the resulting measurements will have to be carefully scrutinized because of the extremely variable testing conditions under which such measurements will be obtained.

AB  - Four-parameter models have received increasing psychometric attention in recent years, as a reduced upper asymptote for item characteristic curves can be appealing for measurement applications such as adaptive testing and person-fit assessment. However, applications can be challenging due to the large number of parameters in the model. In this article, we demonstrate in the context of mathematics assessments how the slip and guess parameters of a four-parameter model may often be empirically related. This observation also has a psychological explanation to the extent that both asymptote parameters may be manifestations of a single item complexity characteristic. The relationship between lower and upper asymptotes motivates the consideration of an asymmetric item response theory model as a three-parameter alternative to the four-parameter model. Using actual response data from mathematics multiple-choice tests, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of a three-parameter asymmetric model in several standardized tests of mathematics. To the extent that a model of asymmetry ultimately portrays slips and guesses not as purely random but rather as proficiency-related phenomena, we argue that the asymmetric approach may also have greater psychological plausibility.

AB  - Investigated the susceptibility to item location effects of 10 item types from the Graduate Record Examination General Test, which was administered to approximately 4,000 examinees in 1 of 2 operational forms, by comparing the item difficulty parameters of sets of items across intended usages to identify location effects as a form of multidimensionality. Results show that 2 of the 10 item types, analysis of explanations and logical diagrams, were clearly affected by item location in the population tested. A common item type, reading comprehension, was affected somewhat by item context. Examples of testing situations where location effects are important are described. It is recommended that these item types not be used in an adaptive testing program without assessing their susceptibility to location effects within the population (and subpopulations) of interest.

AB  - Four item selection methods are compared and investigated under three test formats in the context of Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing (MCAT) delivering polytomous items partially or completely in tests. Item selection methods examined include Fisher information based D-optimality (D-optimality), Kullback-Leibler information index (KI), mutual information (MI), and continuous entropy method (CEM). The three test formats considered are the POLYTYPE format that contains polytomous items with three response categories, the DPMIX format that delivers dichotomous items at the beginning and polytomous items at the final stage, and the PDMIX format that has the reverse order as DPMIX. In general, D-optimality shows the best estimation accuracy and conditional estimation accuracy. D-optimality, MI, and CEM are similar in terms of ability estimation accuracy and tendency in selecting items when the item bank size is large. For both dichotomous and polytomous items, KI is mostly outperformed by the other three methods in terms of ability estimation precision. When sub-thetas in both dimensions are equal, however, KI shows the best performance for polytomous items. In this study, which item type, dichotomous or polytomous, being administered first does not affect the estimation accuracy. However, if the test length is much longer or shorter than the test length of the current study, it is possible that the estimation accuracy could be affected by the order of delivering different item types. Both DPMIX and PDMIX formats yield similar conditional estimation accuracy pattern and precision. In addition, the item bank size does affect the estimation precision. These conclusions, however, might not be applied to MCAT testing with different test designs or item pool structures. More studies are needed in MCAT combining with polytomous items to further facilitate the development and improvement of the next-generation assessments such as formative assessment or testing for diagnosis.

AB  - Given the rapid advancement of computer technology, the importance of administering adaptive tests with polytomous items is in great need. With regard to the applicability of adaptive testing using polytomous IRT models, adaptive testing can use polytomous items of either rating scales, or in some testing situations of multiple choice. Additionally, the availability of computerized polytomous scoring of open-ended items enhances such applicability. This need promotes the research in polytomous adaptive testing (PAT). This dissertation is an effort to focus on item selection methods, as a major component, in polytomous computerized adaptive testing. So, it consists of five chapters that cover the following: Chapter 1 focuses on a thorough introduction to the item response theory (IRT) models and adaptive testing related to polytomous items. Such an important overview and introduction to basic concepts in test theory and mathematical models for polytomous items is needed for the flow of consequent chapters. Chapter 2 is devoted to the development of a central location index (LI) to uniquely represent the polytomous item with a scale value parameter using most commonly used polytomous models. The motivation and rationale to search for a central or an overall location parameter is twofold: (a) the confusion of multiple and different parameterizations for a polytomous item even for the same model, and (b) the unavailability of such single location parameter block the usage of certain item selection methods in adaptive testing. Two approaches are used to derive the proposed LIs, one is based on the item category response functions (ICRFs) and the other is based on the polytomous item response function (IRF). As a result, four LIs are proposed. Chapter 3 is particularly assigned to development of an item selection method based on the developed location index and primarily assess its performance in the PAT context relative to existing methods. This method belongs to the non-information based item selection methods and we referred it as Matching-LI method. The results support that this proposed method is promising and is capable to produce accurate ability estimates and successfully manage the item pool usage. Chapter 4 introduces new item selection methods taking in consideration the previous chapter's results. The new methods are the hybrid, stage-based information, polytomous a-stratification methods. The first two methods try to merge more than one criterion for selecting items of each PAT (e.g., the hybrid method merges both the Matching-LI and maximum information (MI) methods). The last method uses Matching-LI method within each stratum. Chapter 5 provides discussion, conclusions, and limitations and future research directions with respect to important components of an adaptive testing program (i.e., item selection methods, item response models, item banks, and trait versus attribute estimation).

AB  - Item selection strategy (ISS) is an important component of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). Its performance directly affects the security, efficiency and precision of the test. Thus, ISS becomes one of the central issues in CATs based on the Graded Response Model (GRM). It is well known that the goal of IIS is to administer the next unused item remaining in the item bank that best fits the examinees current ability estimate. In dichotomous IRT models, every item has only one difficulty parameter and the item whose difficulty matches the examinee's current ability estimate is considered to be the best fitting item. However, in GRM, each item has more than two ordered categories and has no single value to represent the item difficulty. Consequently, some researchers have used to employ the average or the median difficulty value across categories as the difficulty estimate for the item. Using the average value and the median value in effect introduced two corresponding ISSs. In this study, we used computer simulation compare four ISSs based on GRM. We also discussed the effect of 'shadow pool' on the uniformity of pool usage as well as the influence of different item parameter distributions and different ability estimation methods on the evaluation criteria of CAT. In the simulation process, Monte Carlo method was adopted to simulate the entire CAT process; 1,000 examinees drawn from standard normal distribution and four 1,000-sized item pools of different item parameter distributions were also simulated. The assumption of the simulation is that a polytomous item is comprised of six ordered categories. In addition, ability estimates were derived using two methods. They were expected a posteriori Bayesian (EAP) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In MLE, the Newton-Raphson iteration method and the Fisher Score iteration method were employed, respectively, to solve the likelihood equation. Moreover, the CAT process was simulated with each examinee 30 times to eliminate random error. The IISs were evaluated by four indices usually used in CAT from four aspects--the accuracy of ability estimation, the stability of IIS, the usage of item pool, and the test efficiency. Simulation results showed adequate evaluation of the ISS that matched the estimate of an examinee's current trait level with the difficulty values across categories. Setting 'shadow pool' in ISS was able to improve the uniformity of pool utilization. Finally, different distributions of the item parameter and different ability estimation methods affected the evaluation indices of CAT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by Robert D. Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2020-75129-001[/rid]). Gibbons et al. demonstrated the utility of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) based on multidimensional item response theory for the assessment of depression, anxiety, mania/hypomania, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and suicidality in children and adolescents. The web-based versions of the KSADS-COMP has many advantages over its predecessor, including streamlined assessment time, automated scoring, branching and tracking of supplements, and availability of symptom-level and diagnostic reports in real time. Both the self- and the clinician-administered versions of the KSADS-COMP are particularly useful when conducting telehealth assessments. The K-CAT and KSADS-COMP both leverage technology to make the diagnostic process more efficient. In addition to dimensional measures of psychopathology, the KSADS-COMP provides categorical diagnoses, the necessary information to facilitate differential diagnosis, and information about the context of the child<e2><80><99>s life.

The Computerized Adaptive Testing<e2><80><93>Anxiety Inventory (CAT-ANX) was introduced as a new 'test for anxiety,' with suggested large-scale screening uses and planned commercial availability. The pool of over 400 items has not been demonstrated to have construct validity or predictive validity. The resultant CAT-ANX was not validated against existing anxiety scales. Test-retest reliability was not demonstrated. The 'anxiety' of CAT-ANX was not defined. It is not coterminous with generalized anxiety disorder, although the article focused on this disorder. Operationally, CAT-ANX draws from many. The data in the article thus provide no sound basis to say that screening with CAT-ANX will allow confident, rapid, and accurate positive identification of key clinical anxiety diagnoses.

AB  - Measurement informed care is a cornerstone of evidence-based practice and shared decision-making. A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient<e2><80><99>s perspective of the presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of executive function, emotional regulation, mindwandering, and sluggish cognitive tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients. Psychometrically validated tools are available to complement every aspect of ADHD care and provide global standards for research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Diabetes is an increasing global health and economic burden that is frequently associated with and worsened by clinically significant depression or anxiety. This chapter focuses on the history and evolution of the concept of depression and will also describe some of the uncertainties and controversy surrounding psychiatric nosology. Depression as a syndrome of pathological emotions should be diagnosed using operationalized criteria; however, at the same time, depression should not be reified as a discrete construct with absolute boundaries. Depression is often comorbid with anxiety and other mental disorders, which could be clinically important for diabetes. As with other medical syndromes, there is substantial heterogeneity between patients within psychiatric diagnostic groups. Clinically significant depression is defined using cutoff scores for self-rated symptoms using various psychometrics, which correlate reasonably well with operationalized diagnoses. Both methods classify persons into clinically significant dichotomies of depression for diabetes. This chapter considers the implications of these diagnoses for clinical practice and makes suggestions as to the way forward both in terms of the identification of people with comorbid depression and diabetes and for treatment and care. Computerized assessment, for example, with computerized adaptive testing (CAT), can facilitate time-efficient depression screening in busy clinic settings.

AB  - Objective: Caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often feel pressure to maintain the appearance that they are emotionally well adjusted, despite feelings to the contrary. Because there are currently no measures examining this construct, this article focuses on the development of a new measure that is specific to caregivers of people with TBI. Design: A total of 533 caregivers of civilians with TBI (n = 218) or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n = 315) completed 43 emotional suppression items, as well as other patient-reported outcomes and an estimate of the functional ability of the person with TBI. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the retention of 25 items. Graded response model (GRM) analyses and differential item functioning (DIF) studies supported the retention of 21 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM calibration data were used to develop a 6-item static short form (SF) and program a computer adaptive test (CAT). Internal consistency was excellent for both the CAT and SF (reliabilities <e2><89><a5> 0.91); 3-week test<e2><80><93>retest stability was good (all intraclass correlations <e2><89><a5> 0.89). Convergent validity was supported by moderate associations between TBI-CareQOL Emotional Suppression and related measures (rs from 0.47 to 0.59); discriminant validity was supported by small correlations between Emotional Suppression and positive aspects of caregiving and physical health (rs from 0.14 to 0.28). Known-groups validity was also supported. Conclusions: The new TBI-CareQOL Emotional Suppression CAT and 6-item short form is the first self-report measure of this construct in this population. Our findings suggest this new measure has strong psychometric properties. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Physical activity (PA) and sleep are leading health indicators for individuals of all ages. Monitoring young children<e2><80><99>s PA and sleep using psychometrically sound instruments could help facilitate timely interventions to promote healthy development. This article describes the development of the PROMIS<c2><ae> Early Childhood (EC) Parent Report Physical Activity (PA) and Sleep Problems (SP) measures for children aged 1<e2><80><93>5 years. Methods: Item pools were generated by interviewing parents, input from content experts, and literature review. Data from a U.S. general population sample were used to determine factor structures of item pools via factor analytic approaches, estimate item parameters via item response theory (IRT) models, and establish norms. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate across-domain associations. Analysis of variance was used and known-groups<e2><80><99> validity of PA and SP by comparing their scores to PROMIS EC Parent Report Global Health: child<e2><80><99>s physical, emotional, and mental conditions. Results: Initial item pools consisted of 19 and 26 items for PA and SP, respectively. Factor analyses<e2><80><99> results supported unidimensionality of 5 and 16 items measuring PA and SP, respectively, which were then calibrated using IRT. Norms were established by centering to a probability-based U.S. general population. Computerized adaptive testing algorithms were established. Some analyses supported initial measure validity. Conclusions: The PROMIS EC PA calibrated scale and SP item banks are user-friendly and brief, yet produce precise scores. Both measures enable psychometrically sound assessment of PA behavior and sleep problems. Future studies to comprehensively evaluate the validity of these two measures are warranted.

TI  - Measuring quality of life in patients with schizophrenia: An update

AB  - In 1997, we published a review in PharmacoEconomics about quality of life (QOL) measurement in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this article is to provide an update, as well as to revisit the development of the construct of QOL and its measurement as applied to schizophrenia. Since our previous article, there has been significant growth in the number of publications about QOL in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, alongside this significant increase in research interest, a number of concerns have also risen about the limitations and lack of impact the concept of QOL has on clinical care and health-policy decision making. A number of concerns previously outlined (such as lack of consensus on a uniform definition of QOL) continue to be an issue. However, we believe that a uniform definition may not be possible, and instead, it may be preferable to have several definitions, which may enrich the concept and broaden its usefulness. Some of the scales we reviewed in 1997 continue to be in use, while others are now rarely or never used. New scales with better psychometrics have been introduced, but most are without theoretical or conceptual foundation. On the other hand, the field of scaling in general has been changing over the past few years and is moving towards a new approach for scale development, based on item response theory, item banks and computer adaptive testing. Unfortunately, this has not extended to QOL in schizophrenia. There continues to be a dearth of theoretical and conceptual models for QOL in schizophrenia, which seems to create the perception that the construct lacks a good theoretical and scientific foundation. One of the major gaps identified in this review is the recognized lack of impact of QOL measurements on clinical management or policy decision making. The majority of publications continue to focus on measurement rather than what to do with the data. The lack of strategies to integrate QOL data in clinical care, as well as the failure to contribute to policy decisions, particularly in cost analysis or resource allocations, has created the perception that the construct of QOL in schizophrenia is not that useful. It is evident that, for QOL in schizophrenia to regain its promise, researchers must take the ultimate next step beyond measurement: to develop credible strategies for integrating QOL data in clinical practice. Additionally, more focused research is needed to demonstrate the role of QOL, not only as an outcome in itself but also as a contributor to other outcomes, such as adherence to medications, more satisfaction, less resource utilization and so on. Since self-appraisal of QOL does not happen in a vacuum but relates to the total human experience in all its biological, psychosocial and environmental aspects, particular attention must also be focused on important neurobiological dimensions such as affect and cognition. Both are significantly affected by the illness itself and its treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We introduce the Berlin Numeracy Test, a new psychometrically sound instrument that quickly assesses statistical numeracy and risk literacy. We present 21 studies (n = 5336) showing robust psychometric discriminability across 15 countries (e.g., Germany, Pakistan, Japan, USA) and diverse samples (e.g., medical professionals, general populations, Mechanical Turk web panels). Analyses demonstrate desirable patterns of convergent validity (e.g., numeracy, general cognitive abilities), discriminant validity (e.g., personality, motivation), and criterion validity (e.g., numerical and non-numerical questions about risk). The Berlin Numeracy Test was found to be the strongest predictor of comprehension of everyday risks (e.g., evaluating claims about products and treatments; interpreting forecasts), doubling the predictive power of other numeracy instruments and accounting for unique variance beyond other cognitive tests (e.g., cognitive reflection, working memory, intelligence). The Berlin Numeracy Test typically takes about three minutes to complete and is available in multiple languages and formats, including a computer adaptive test that automatically scores and reports data to researchers (www.riskliteracy.org). The online forum also provides interactive content for public outreach and education, and offers a recommendation system for test format selection. Discussion centers on construct validity of numeracy for risk literacy, underlying cognitive mechanisms, and applications in adaptive decision support.

AB  - Although social well-being (SWB) is recognized as an integral component of health, it is rarely included in health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments. Two SWB dimensions were identified by literature review: social support (SWB-SS) and social function (SWB-SF). As part of a larger project to develop item response theory-derived item banks and computerized adaptive testing, we developed and tested items for the SWB banks. Item ratings of three large (n > 600) datasets were conducted by 15 reviewers. Rasch measurement analyses were conducted to initially define item hierarchies. Out of 83 total items, 8 were removed due to model misfit and 8 were removed because of overlapping item content. We then wrote 11 new SWB-SS and 16 new SWB-SF items to fill content gaps, and edited items to improve comprehension and consistency. A total of 94 items (65 SWB-SS, 29 SWB-SF) was administered by computer to 202 cancer patients. Confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch analyses, and evaluations of construct validity were performed. Patients commented favorably on the content of the items and expressed appreciation for attention to this aspect of their HRQL. Using current psychometric standards for unidimensionality, reliability, and content and construct validity, we derived six preliminary item banks for social support (instrumental support, informational support, positive and negative emotional support, positive and negative social companionship) and two for social function (limitations and satisfaction). The empirical construct hierarchy was consistent with clinical observations; e.g., hobbies and leisure activities tended to reflect more limitations, while meeting the needs of family and friends tended to reflect fewer limitations. Optimal care for patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses includes obtaining a complete picture of patients<e2><80><99> physical and psychosocial health status. SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment can affect quality of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment.

AB  - Background: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have social and communication deficits that impair their involvement in family life. No measures of child involvement in the family have been validated for the ASD population. Aim: To evaluate the validity of a measure of Family Involvement (FI) of children ages 5<e2><80><93>12 with ASD. Method: Parents of children ages 5<e2><80><93>12 with ASD (n = 114) completed FI items from the PROMIS<c2><ae> pediatric Family Relationships item bank in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format, as well as measures of ASD symptom burden, parenting stress, and parental depression. Medical record review provided child intelligence or developmental quotient. A reference sample (n = 236) closely matching the ASD sample in age and gender was created from the national standardization sample, and underwent a simulated CAT. Results: The CAT precisely and efficiently measured parent-reported FI of children with ASD. Average FI scores were lower among children with ASD (M = 46.3, SD = 7.1) than children in the reference sample (M = 52.5, SD = 9.1). A 'dose response' decrease in FI was observed as ASD severity increased. Increased parenting stress was associated with lower FI. No relationship between FI and child IQ was found. Conclusion: The FI items captured FI among children ages 5<e2><80><93>12 with ASD with acceptable precision. Reduced FI among children with ASD, particularly those with higher symptom severity, suggests validity of the items in this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Working memory tasks designed for children usually present trials in order of ascending difficulty, with testing discontinued when the child fails a particular level. Unfortunately, this procedure comes with a number of issues, such as decreased engagement from high-ability children, vulnerability of the scores to temporary mind-wandering, and large between-subjects variations in number of trials, testing time, and proactive interference. To circumvent these problems, the goal of the present study was to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing working memory using an adaptive testing procedure. The principle of adaptive testing is to dynamically adjust the level of difficulty as the task progresses to match the participant's ability. We used this method to develop an adaptive complex span task (the ACCES) comprising verbal and visuo-spatial subtests. The task presents a fixed number of trials to all participants, allows for partial credit scoring, and can be used with children regardless of ability level. The ACCES demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in a sample of 268 children aged 8<e2><80><93>13 years, confirming the feasibility of using adaptive tasks to measure working memory capacity in children. A free-to-use implementation of the ACCES is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study focused on the effect of examinees<e2><80><99> ability levels on the relationship between Reflective-Impulsive (RI) cognitive style and item response time in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The total of 56 students majoring in Educational Technology from Shandong Normal University participated in this study, and their RI cognitive styles were diagnosed using the Matching Familiar Figures Test-20 (MFFT-20). Examinees<e2><80><99> ability values and average item response time were recorded by the computerized adaptive testing system. Then mediation analysis was implemented and the findings revealed that there was direct and indirect effect between RI cognitive style and item response time in CAT. What<e2><80><99>s more, RI cognitive style also directly affected the ability levels, and then the ability levels impacted on item response time. So, examinee<e2><80><99>s ability level was a partly mediator between RI cognitive style and item response time. Furthermore, RI cognitive style of the examinees might also be diagnosed according to ability values and average item response time. The relevant research and implications were further discussed.

AB  - Depression and anxiety disorders are common conditions with significant morbidity. Many screening tools of varying length have been well validated for these conditions in the office-based setting. Novel instruments, including Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, may be promising tools in the future. The best evidence for cost-effectiveness currently is for screening of major depression linked with the collaborative care model for treatment. Data are not conclusive regarding comparative cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple conditions at once or for other conditions. This article reviews screening tools for depression and anxiety disorders in the ambulatory setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study explored calibrating a large item bank for use in multidimensional health measurement with computerized adaptive testing, using both item responses and response time (RT) information. The Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care is a patient-reported outcomes measure comprised of three correlated scales (Applied Cognition, Daily Activities, and Mobility). All items from each scale are Likert type, so that a respondent chooses a response from an ordered set of four response options. The most appropriate item response theory model for analyzing and scoring these items is the multidimensional graded response model (MGRM). During the field testing of the items, an interviewer read each item to a patient and recorded, on a tablet computer, the patient's responses and the software recorded RTs. Due to the large item bank with over 300 items, data collection was conducted in four batches with a common set of anchor items to link the scale. van der Linden's (2007) hierarchical modeling framework was adopted. Several models, with or without interviewer as a covariate and with or without interaction between interviewer and items, were compared for each batch of data. It was found that the model with the interaction between interviewer and item, when the interaction effect was constrained to be proportional, fit the data best. Therefore, the final hierarchical model with a lognormal model for RT and the MGRM for response data was fitted to all batches of data via a concurrent calibration. Evaluation of parameter estimates revealed that (1) adding response time information did not affect the item parameter estimates and their standard errors significantly; (2) adding response time information helped reduce the standard error of patients' multidimensional latent trait estimates, but adding interviewer as a covariate did not result in further improvement. Implications of the findings for follow up adaptive test delivery design are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study extended Warm's (1989) weighted likelihood estimation (WLE) to a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT) setting. WLE was compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), expected a posteriori (EAP), and maximum a posteriori (MAP) using a three-dimensional 3PL IRT model under a variety of computerized adaptive testing conditions. The dependent variables included bias, standard error of ability estimates (SE), square root of mean square error (RMSE), and test information. The independent variables were ability estimation methods, intercorrelation levels between dimensions, multidimensional structures, and ability combinations. Simulation results were presented in terms of descriptive statistics, such as figures and tables. In addition, inferential procedures were used to analyze bias by conceptualizing this Monte Carlo study as a statistical sampling experiment. The results of this study indicate that WLE and the other three estimation methods yield significantly more accurate ability estimates under an approximate simple test structure with one dominant dimension and several secondary dimensions. All four estimation methods, especially WLE, yield very large SEs when a three equally dominant multidimensional structure was employed. Consistent with previous findings based on unidimensional IRT model, MLE and WLE are less biased in the extreme of the ability scale; MLE and WLE yield larger SEs than the Bayesian methods; test information-based SEs underestimate actual SEs for both MLE and WLE in MCAT situations, especially at shorter test lengths; WLE reduced the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure; test information-based SEs underestimates the actual SEs of MLE and WLE estimators in the MCAT conditions, similar to the findings of Warm (1989) in the unidimensional case. The results from the MCAT simulations did show some advantages of WLE in reducing the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure with a fixed test length of 50 items, which was consistent with the previous research findings based on different unidimensional models. It is clear from the current results that all four methods perform very poorly when the multidimensional structures with multiple dominant factors were employed. More research efforts are urged to investigate systematically how different multidimensional structures affect the accuracy and reliability of ability estimation. Based on the simulated results in this study, there is no significant effect found on the ability estimation from the intercorrelation between dimensions.

AB  - Objective: Self-report questionnaires are widely used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Ideally, such questionnaires should be adapted to the individual patient and at the same time scores should be directly comparable across patients. This may be achieved using computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Usually, CAT is carried out for a single domain at a time. However, many HRQOL domains are highly correlated. Multidimensional CAT may utilize these correlations to improve measurement efficiency. We investigated the possible advantages and difficulties of multidimensional CAT. Study Design and Setting: We evaluated multidimensional CAT of three scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30: the physical functioning, emotional functioning, and fatigue scales. Analyses utilised a database with 2958 European cancer patients. Results: It was possible to obtain scores for the three domains with five to seven items administered using multidimensional CAT that were very close to the scores obtained using all 12 items and with no or little loss of measurement precision. Conclusion: The findings suggest that multidimensional CAT may significantly improve measurement precision and efficiency and encourage further research into multidimensional CAT. Particularly, the estimation of the model underlying the multidimensional CAT and the conceptual aspects need further investigations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) purports to combine the strengths of both CAT and cognitive diagnosis. Cognitive diagnosis models aim at classifying examinees into the correct mastery profile group so as to pinpoint the strengths and weakness of each examinee whereas CAT algorithms choose items to determine those strengths and weakness as efficiently as possible. Most of the existing CD-CAT item selection algorithms are evaluated when test length is relatively long whereas several applications of CD-CAT, such as in interim assessment, require an item selection algorithm that is able to accurately recover examinees<e2><80><99> mastery profile with short test length. In this article, we introduce the mutual information item selection method in the context of CD-CAT and then provide a computationally easier formula to make the method more amenable in real time. Mutual information is then evaluated against common item selection methods, such as Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler information, posterior weighted Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler information, and Shannon entropy. Based on our simulations, mutual information consistently results in nearly the highest attribute and pattern recovery rate in more than half of the conditions.We conclude by discussing how the number of attributes, Q-matrix structure, correlations among the attributes, and item quality affect estimation accuracy.

AB  - Comments on an article by A. C. de Campos et al. (see record [rid]2020-09950-001[/rid]). Campos et al. investigated the sensorimotor cortical activation during symmetric and asymmetric bimanual tasks in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The main finding of the study suggests greater activation in bilateral sensorimotor cortices in children with unilateral CP compared to age-matched typically developing children. Moreover, the sensorimotor cortical activation was higher during asymmetric versus symmetric tasks. The finding of the study reveals correlation between greater activation within the sensorimotor cortices and synchronized electromyography (EMG) activity of flexor carpi radialis muscle. More synchronized EMG activity during asymmetric tasks potentially indicates reduced selective control of the arm; however, further investigation should consider the severity of hemiplegia and presence or absence of mirror movements, since these factors might significantly affect the correlation. Third, the study results indicate strong correlation between laterality index shifted to non-lesioned hemisphere and better function on the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory computer adaptive test (PEDI-CAT). These results contradict the evidence that collectively shows contra-lesional shift of laterality index as a marker of poor hand function. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To develop psychometrically sound, culturally relevant, and linguistically equivalent English and Spanish self-report measures of social health guided by a comprehensive conceptual model and applicable across chronic illnesses. Methods: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Social Health Workgroup implemented a mixed methods approach to evaluate earlier results (v1.0); expand and refine domain definitions and items; translate items into Spanish; and obtain qualitative feedback. Computer-based and paper/pencil questionnaire administration was conducted with a variety of U.S. respondent samples during 2009<e2><80><93>2012. Analyses included exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), two-parameter logistic item response theory (IRT) modeling, evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF), and evaluation of criterion and construct validity. Results: Qualitative feedback supported the conceptualization of the Social Health domain framework (Social Function and Social Relationships subcomponents). Validation testing participants (n = 2,208 English; n = 644 Spanish) were diverse in terms of gender, age, education, and ethnicity/race. EFA, CFA, and IRT identified 7 unidimensional factors with good model fit. There was no DIF by language, and good evidence of criterion and construct validity. Conclusions: PROMIS English and Spanish language instruments (v2.0), including computer-adaptive tests and fixed-length short forms, are publicly available for assessment of Social Function (Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, and Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities) and Social Relationships (Companionship; Emotional, Informational and Instrumental Support; and Social Isolation). Measures of social health will play a key role in applications that use ecologic (or determinants of health) models that emphasize how patients<e2><80><99> social environments influence their health.

AB  - Interest in developing computerized adaptive testing (CAT) under cognitive diagnostic models has increased recently. Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) attempt to classify examinees into the correct latent class profile so as to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of each examinee whereas CAT algorithms choose items from the item bank to achieve that goal as efficiently as possible. Most of the research in CD-CAT uses the posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler (PWKL) index due to its high efficiency. The PWKL index integrated the posterior probabilities of examinees' latent class profiles into the KL information, and thus improved item selection efficiency considerably. However, the PWKL index only used examinee-based information to assess the relative importance of each latent class profile. The current study attempted to take advantage of not only the examinee-base information but also the item-based information that could be readily obtained from items. In a sense, the PWKL index should be regarded as single-source index. This paper introduced four new multiple-source item selection methods, GIDPWKL, AIDPWKL, CIDPWKL, and KLEDPWKL respectively, which can be modified from the PWKL index by combining the item discrimination information. Two simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the new methods' efficiency against the PWKL index and mutual information (MI) index in the DINA model with the exposure control. The effects of different factors were investigated: the Q matrix structure (simple vs. complex), item quality (high vs. low) and test length (moderate vs. short). Simulation results indicated that: (1) In most cases, the shorter the test length was. the higher AACCR and PCCR values the four new methods would have in the fix-length test. The GIDPWKL index had the highest average attribute correct classification rate and pattern correct classification rate among the six methods, and followed by AIDPWKL index. The performance among the CIDPWKL. KLEDPWKL. and MI depends on the experimental conditions. (2) In most cases, the higher the item quality was. the more advantage the four new methods would have in the fix-length test. (3) The structure of the Q matrix affected the performance of different item selection methods. (4) In the variable-length test, the mean of test length across all examinees for the four new methods and MI method were all smaller than those in the PWKL method. As a whole, the performance of the GIDPWKL index was the best, and should be recommended in practice where had the similar testing scenarios.

AB  - This article presents a literature review of office-based screening of common psychiatric conditions. Depression and anxiety disorders remain significant conditions in the primary care setting and in the general population. Screening tools for depression and anxiety disorders are freely available with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Novel screening methods, including Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, are in development and may be promising tools in the future. Despite the availability of these tools and a need to improve the mental health of patients, the utility of widespread use of screening for depression and anxiety disorders in the primary care, office-based setting is uncertain, and guidelines have reached different conclusions. The best evidence for cost effectiveness currently is for screening of major depression as part of the collaborative care model for treatment. Targeted screening is another reasonable approach in patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions or certain medical conditions. Despite unanswered questions, with further research, a growing literature, and increased awareness of mental health, there is every reason for optimism for the future of mental health screening.

CY  - NA
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is an efficient testing mode, which allows each examinee to answer appropriate items according his or her latent trait level. The implementation of CAT requires a large-scale item pool, and item pool needs to be frequently replenished with new items to ensure test validity and security. Online calibration is a technique to calibrate the parameters of new items in CAT, which seeds new items in the process of answering operational items, and estimates the parameters of new items through the response data of examinees on new items. The most popular estimation methods include one EM cycle method (OEM) and multiple EM cycle method (MEM) under dichotomous item response theory models. This paper extends OEM and MEM to the graded response model (GRM), a popular model for polytomous data with ordered categories. Two simulation studies were carried out to explore online calibration under a variety of conditions, including calibration design, initial item parameter calculation methods, calibration methods, calibration sample size and the number of categories. Results show that the calibration accuracy of new items were acceptable, and which were affected by the interaction of some factors, therefore some conclusions were given.

AB  - In this guide, the authors outline the advantages of online eAssessment and examine the intellectual, technical, legal and cost issues that arise from its use. This guide outlines the major assessment types that are suitable for online assessment and makes a key distinction between formative and summative assessment. The focus is primarily on the latter since that is where the difficulties are most acute and robust systems most critical. A range of practical issues relating to the key stages in running a summative e-exam are explored and advice given on system requirements and on how to ensure that the exam runs smoothly when you 'go live'. This section includes consideration of the way that using eAssessment might affect the standard setting and results analysis process. The section on future trends in online assessment explores possibilities such as computer adaptive testing and the automated assessment of free text answers. Finally, there is a consideration of the implications of these trends for management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice (EBBP) is a transdisciplinary systematic approach that emphasizes the use of best evidence in combination with clinical expertise, as well as patient preferences and values, to make clinically-informed decisions about care and treatment (Spring, 2007). Despite numerous benefits and strong policy support of EBBP, findings indicate that clinicians generally fail to implement EBBP in standard clinical practice due to a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and low self-efficacy associated with an absence of resources. To address the need for EBBP resources and tools, Bonnie Spring, PhD and colleagues developed a theory-driven website for graduate students and clinicians. The website is primarily comprised of two components: nine interactive training modules and a novel assessment portal that utilizes patient-reported computer adaptive tests (CATs). To date, the training modules and assessment portal have not been evaluated, and there is currently a critical need to incorporate mixed methods evaluations into EBBP implementation science. The goal of this dissertation is to contribute to the ongoing evaluation and optimization of the EBBP Project by conducting summative and implementation-focused formative evaluations of its training modules and assessment portal. Aim 1 evaluated changes in user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy for each EBBP module and determined whether these outcomes varied by user characteristics, including degree, professional discipline, and number of completed modules. Together, findings suggested heightened interest and use of asynchronous, web-based training modules about EBBP in social work and psychology, and that these modules can produce short-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about EBBP. Overall, however, attrition continues to be a challenge. To better understand the attrition rates of the EBBP training modules and web-based modules, in general, Aim 2 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics related to module engagement. Overall, findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses (i.e., mixed method analyses) revealed that specific instructional guidance and interactive features, coupled with user technical knowledge, are particularly important characteristics that may improve engagement in asynchronous web-based training modules. Given the novelty of the EBBP assessment portal, Aim 3 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics associated with its engagement and implementation. Results from mixed method analyses suggested that user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy, coupled with programmatic functions to ensure privacy and confidentiality of patient information, may be important characteristics to improving engagement with a CATs-based assessment portal. In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information on the short-term effectiveness of asynchronous web-based modules, and factors that may contribute to engagement and implementation of online training and clinical tools for EBBP.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the results from a simulated computerized adaptive test (CAT) for the 28-item Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire and the original paper-pencil version in terms of efficiency (main outcome), defined as percentage item reduction. METHODS: Using paper-pencil IVI data from 832 participants across the spectrum of vision impairment, item calibrations of the 28-item IVI instrument and its associated 20-item vision-specific functioning (VSF) and 8-item emotional well-being (EWB) subscales were generated with Rasch analysis. Based on these calibrations, CAT simulations were conducted on 1000 cases, with 'high' and 'moderate' precision stopping rules (standard error of measurement [SEM] 0.387 and 0.521, respectively). We examined the average number of items needed to satisfy the stopping rules and the corresponding percentage item reduction, level of agreement between person measures estimated from the full IVI item bank and from the CAT simulations, and item exposure rates (IER). RESULTS: For the overall IVI-CAT, 5 or 9.7 items were required, on average, to obtain moderate or high precision estimates of vision-related quality of life, corresponding to 82.1 and 65.4% item reductions compared to the paper-pencil IVI. Agreement was high between the person measures generated from the full IVI item bank and the IVI-CAT for both the high precision simulation (mean bias, - 0.004 logits; 95% LOA - 0.594 to 0.587) and moderate precision simulation (mean bias, 0.014 logits; 95% LOA - 0.828 to 0.855). The IER for the IVI-CAT in the moderate precision simulation was skewed, with six EWB items used > 40% of the time. CONCLUSION: Compared to the paper-pencil IVI instrument, the IVI-CATs required fewer items without loss of measurement precision, making them potentially attractive outcome instruments for implementation into clinical trials, healthcare, and research. Final versions of the IVI-CATs are available.

AB  - Along with the development of computer technology and increasing needs of individual learning, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has received more and more attention. However, the problem of the test security is becoming a new challenge to the CAT, for example, excessive exposure of the test items might weaken the efficiency and equity of the CAT. Therefore, constructing a large-scale and high-quality CAT item bank is highly demanded The traditional method of constructing a CAT item bank involves four steps: first, the items are developed by the experts according to the test specification and blueprint; second, a representative sample of examinees is recruited to take the test; Then, the calibration of item parameters and testing of the model-data fit will be conducted afterward. Finally, items of high-quality and its item parameters will be added into the item bank based on the pre-analysis. However, several problems exist in the above traditional method. First, a large number of test takers are needed, which is time-consuming and expensive. Second, the security of the items cannot be guaranteed in the pilot test. Third, complicated techniques of equating may have to be used to construct a good item bank, which may also affect the security of the items, especially when the anchor items are repeatedly used in the test equating process. Thus, if the raw items can be seeded in the CAT process and the item parameters combined with the examinee abilities estimated at the same time, it will be significant for the construction of CAT item bank. The research in this area has not been widely conducted and reported in the domestic journals, although this issue has been a big topic for foreign researchers. Thus, This study aims to explore how to insert raw items and estimate the item parameters in CAT and investigate the efficient strategies with high security for enlarging the item bank. A new online calibration method is proposed based on the principle of adaption in CAT, provided there is a small-scale item pool. And the formula of initial value during the stage of the iteration is determined. When the ability parameter has been estimated, the conditional maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) will be implemented to estimate item parameters in the raw items. First, the difficulty parameter could be obtained through CMLE. Second, the discrimination parameter could be estimated with the abilities and difficulty parameter and the initial value of the discrimination parameter could be gained through CMLE. Third, the difficulty parameter could be estimated when the discrimination parameter and abilities are known. Repeat the second and the third steps until the stop condition is satisfied. Simulation of Monte Carlo has been employed to estimate the parameters of raw items with the one-parameter Logistic and two-parameter Logistic models in the study and good result has been gained.

AB  - Objective: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk assessments need to be validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of a highly efficient computerized adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among SGMY. Methods: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n = 1,073) and at their follow-up visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity were performed. Results: Younger, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual (e.g., bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender nonconforming or nongender binary (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior wave. Conclusions: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for the identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual, and gender nonconforming or nongender binary. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Public Health Statement<e2><80><94>Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) are at disproportionate risk for suicidal ideation, attempts, and death by suicide. This study demonstrated that among SGMY a very brief CAT was more predictive of future suicidality than self-report of prior suicidality. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using this tool could allow for efficient identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (nâ€¯=â€¯248; aged 7-17â€¯years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. RESULTS: Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the convergent validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression measures relative to legacy measures and criterion validity against a structured diagnostic interview for depression in an oncology sample. Methods: 132 oncology/haematology outpatients completed the PROMIS Depression Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-D-CAT) and PROMIS Depression Short Form (PROMIS-D-SF) along with seven legacy measures: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D); Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire; Distress Thermometer and PSYCH-6. Correlations, area under the curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with Structured Clinical Interview as the gold standard. Results: Both PROMIS measures correlated with all legacy measures at p < .001 (Ï = 0.589â€“0.810) and all AUCs (> 0.800) were comparable. At the cut-off points for mild depression of 53, the PROMIS measures had sensitivity (0.83 for PROMIS-D-CAT and 0.80 for PROMIS-D-SF) similar to or better than 6/7 legacy measures with high negative predictive value (> 90%). At cut-off points of 60 for moderate depression, PROMIS measures had specificity > 90%, similar to or better than all legacy measures and positive predictive value â‰¥ 0.50 (similar to 5/7 legacy measures). Conclusions: The convergent and criterion validity of the PROMIS depression measures in cancer populations was confirmed, although the optimal cut-off points are not established. PROMIS measures were briefer than BDI-II and CES-D but do not offer any advance in terms of diagnostic accuracy, reduced response burden or cost over other legacy measures of depression in oncology patients.

AB  - In the present work the psychometric properties of an emotional adjustment computerized adaptive test are described. An examination of Item Response Theory (IRT) research literature indicates that IRT mainly has been used for assessing achievements and ability rather than personality factors. Nevertheless several studies in recent years have shown successful use of IRT with personality assessment instruments. Even so, a few works have inquired about the computerized adaptative test (CAT) features, based on IRT, for the measurement of a personality traits as emotional adjustment. Our results show CAT's efficiency for the assessment of emotional adjustment, so this provides a valid and accurate measurement and uses a smaller number of items in comparison with the emotional adjustment scales from the most strongly established questionnaires.

AB  - Two computerized versions of an English vocabulary test for Spanish speakers (an adaptive and a fixed one) were applied in a Spanish sample of first-year psychology undergraduate students. The effects of test type (computer-adaptive vs computerized-fixed) and review condition (allowed vs not allowed) on several psychological variables were examined. Within subject variables were measured both before and after review to study the effects of review on the psychological and psychometric variables for the review condition in both tests. Two major results were obtained after review: a) a significant increase of correct responses and estimated ability, and b) a decrease of the state-anxiety level. The differences were not significant for measurement error. Interaction effects (test type by moment) were not significant. These and other results concerning the assessment conditions established in this and previous papers are discussed. Finally, the implications that the results may have to establish review conditions in computerized adaptive tests are commented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study focused on the effects of administration mode (computer-adaptive test [CAT] versus self-adaptive test [SAT]), item-by-item answer feedback (present versus absent), and test anxiety on results obtained from computerized vocabulary tests. Examinees were assigned at random to 4 testing conditions (CAT with feedback, CAT without feedback, SAT with feedback, SAT without feedback). Examinees completed the Test Anxiety Inventory before taking their assigned computerized tests. Results show that the CATs were more reliable and took less time to complete than the SATs. Administration time for both the CATs and SATs was shorter when feedback was provided than when it was not, and this difference was most pronounced for examinees at medium to high levels of test anxiety. These results replicate prior findings regarding the precision and administrative efficiency of CATs and SATs but point to new possible benefits of including answer feedback on such tests.

AB  - Background: The construction and evaluation of item banks to measure unidimensional constructs of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a fundamental objective of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) project. Objectives: Item banks will be used as the foundation for developing short-form instruments and enabling computerized adaptive testing. The PROMIS Steering Committee selected 5 HRQOL domains for initial focus: physical functioning, fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and social role participation. This report provides an overview of the methods used in the PROMIS item analyses and proposed calibration of item banks. Analyses: Analyses include evaluation of data quality (eg, logic and range checking, spread of response distribution within an item), descriptive statistics (eg, frequencies, means), item response theory model assumptions (unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity), model fit, differential item functioning, and item calibration for banking. Recommendations: Summarized are key analytic issues; recommendations are provided for future evaluations of item banks in HRQOL assessment.

Two dichotomous scoring methods reflecting exaggerated endorsement and exaggerated denial of socially desirable behaviors were examined. The 1- and 2-parameter logistic models (1PLM, 2PLM, respectively) were applied to dichotomous responses, and the partial credit model (PCM) and graded response model (GRM) were applied to polytomous responses. For both subscales, the 2PLM fit dichotomous responses better than did the 1PLM, and the GRM fit polytomous responses better than did the PCM. Polytomous GRM and raw scores for both subscales yielded higher test<e2><80><93>retest and convergent validity coefficients than did PCM, 1PLM, 2PLM, and dichotomous raw scores. Information plots showed that the GRM provided consistently high measurement precision that was superior to that of all other IRT models over the full range of both construct continuums. Dichotomous scores reflecting exaggerated endorsement of socially desirable behaviors provided noticeably weak precision at low levels of the construct continuums, calling into question the use of such scores for detecting instances of 'faking bad.' Dichotomous models reflecting exaggerated denial of the same behaviors yielded much better precision at low levels of the constructs, but it was still less precision than that of the GRM. These results support polytomous over dichotomous scoring in general, alternative dichotomous scoring for detecting faking bad, and extension of GRM scoring to situations in which IRT offers additional practical advantages over classical test theory (adaptive testing, equating, linking, scaling, detecting differential item functioning, and so forth).

AB  - Item response theory (IRT) provides valuable methods for the analysis of the psychometric properties of a psychological measure. However, IRT has been mainly used for assessing achievements and ability rather than personality factors. This paper presents an application of the IRT to a personality measure. Thus, the psychometric properties of a new emotional adjustment measure that consists of a 28-six graded response items is shown. Classical test theory (CTT) analyses as well as IRT analyses are carried out. Samejima's (1969) graded-response model has been used for estimating item parameters. Results show that the bank of items fulfills model assumptions and fits the data reasonably well, demonstrating the suitability of the IRT models for the description and use of data originating from personality measures. In this sense, the model fulfills the expectations that IRT has undoubted advantages: (1) The invariance of the estimated parameters, (2) the treatment given to the standard error of measurement, and (3) the possibilities offered for the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CAT). The bank of items shows good reliability. It also shows convergent validity compared to the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPQ-A; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) and the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ; Caprara, Barbaranelli, & Borgogni, 1993).

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to validate the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric item banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a, and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in a general Dutch population and to provide reference data. METHODS: Participants (N = 2,893, aged 8-18), recruited by two internet survey providers, completed both item banks. These item banks were assessed on unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity, Graded Response Model (GRM) item fit, and differential item functioning (DIF) for gender, age group, region, ethnicity, and language. The short forms and CATs were assessed on reliability and construct validity compared to the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale short version (RCADS-22) subscales. Reference scores were calculated. RESULTS: Both item banks showed sufficient unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity, and GRM item fit, except for three Depressive Symptoms items that showed insufficient GRM item fit. No DIF was found when using ordinal regression analyses, except for two Depressive Symptoms items that showed DIF for language; all items showed DIF for language when using IRT PRO, except for one Anxiety item. Both short forms and CATs revealed sufficient reliability for moderate and severe levels of anxiety and depression, as well as high positive correlations with corresponding RCADS-22 subscales and slightly lower correlations with non-corresponding RCADS-22 subscales. CONCLUSION: The Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric item banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a and CATs are useful to assess and monitor anxiety and depression in a general population. Reference data are presented.

AB  - Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) Scientific Standards and refined through factor analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI<e2><80><99>s psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI<e2><80><99>s structure and psychometric properties. Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences. Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

AB  - This study aimed to validate the PROMIS<c2><ae> pediatric v2.0 Anger scale in the Dutch general population, provide reference data, and compare reliability and relative efficiency between the full-length scale, its short-form, computerized adaptive test (CAT), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQLTM) emotional functioning (EF) subscale scores. Children (N = 1,328), representative of the Dutch population, were asked to complete the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale (8<e2><80><93>18 years) and PedsQLTM (8<e2><80><93>17 years). A graded response model (GRM) was fit to the data. Structural validity was assessed by checking item-fit statistics (S<e2><88><92>X2, p < .001 = misfit). For construct validity, a moderate correlation (Pearson<e2><80><99>s r > 0.50) was expected between the Anger scale and PedsQLTM EF subscale score. Dutch mean T score based on the U.S. model was calculated to provide reference data and cut-offs. Standard error of measurement (SE(<ce><b8>)) was used to assess reliability (SE(<ce><b8>) < .32 = .90 reliability). Relative efficiency was calculated (1 <e2><88><92> SE(<ce><b8>)2/N items) to compare how good the measures performed relative to the amount of items administered. In total, 527 children completed the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale, of which 482 completed the PedsQLTM. Structural validity was sufficient as no items displayed misfit (S<e2><88><92>X2 = 22.9<e2><80><93>40.3, p > .001). The Anger scale score correlated moderately (Pearson<e2><80><99>s r = .64) with the PedsQLTM EF subscale score. Dutch mean T score was 44.20 (SD = 11.39), with cut-offs of >52.2 for moderate and <e2><89><a5>62.3 for severe symptoms. Reliable measurements were obtained at the population mean and >2SD in the clinically relevant direction. CAT outperformed all other measures in efficiency. The PROMIS pediatric Anger scale displayed sufficient psychometric properties within the Dutch population and reference data are available. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement<e2><80><94>This study provides evidence that the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale has good psychometric properties in the Dutch general population. This scale can thus be implemented in clinical practice and for pediatric research in the Netherlands to solve the problem that validated Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) assessing anger in a pediatric population are missing, improve interpretability and comparison of scores and reduce the burden of completing PROMs for pediatric patients.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of the present study are to investigate the precision of static (fixed-length) short forms versus computerized adaptive testing (CAT) administration, response pattern scoring versus summed score conversion, and test<e2><80><93>retest reliability (stability) of the Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) pediatric self-report scales measuring the latent constructs of depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, pain interference, peer relationships, fatigue, mobility, upper extremity functioning, and asthma impact with polytomous items. Methods: Participants (N = 331) between the ages of 8 and 17 were recruited from outpatient general pediatrics and subspecialty clinics. Of the 331 participants, 137 were diagnosed with asthma. Three scores based on item response theory (IRT) were computed for each respondent: CAT response pattern expected a posteriori estimates, short-form response pattern expected a posteriori estimates, and short-form summed score expected a posteriori estimates. Scores were also compared between participants with and without asthma. To examine test<e2><80><93>retest reliability, 54 children were selected for retesting approximately 2 weeks after the first assessment. Results: A short CAT (maximum 12 items with a standard error of 0.4) was found, on average, to be less precise than the static short forms. The CAT appears to have limited usefulness over and above what can be accomplished with the existing static short forms (8<e2><80><93>10 items). Stability of the scale scores over a 2-week period was generally supported. Conclusion: The study provides further information on the psychometric properties of the PROMIS pediatric scales and extends the previous IRT analyses to include precision estimates of dynamic versus static administration, test<e2><80><93> retest reliability, and validity of administration across groups. Both the positive and negative aspects of using CAT versus short forms are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the psychometric properties (e.g., data distribution characteristics, convergent/discriminant validity, internal consistency reliability, and test administration characteristics) of the spinal cord injury quality of life measurement system (SCI-QOL) Resilience item bank delivered as a computer adaptive test (CAT) in a sample of individuals with chronic pain and spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Descriptive statistics were calculated to investigate variable data distribution characteristics. Correlation analyses were conducted for convergent and discriminant validity. Item response theory-derived reliability was calculated for the SCI-QOL Resilience CAT. RESULT: One hundred thirty-three adults with SCI (N = 133; 73.5% male, 26.5% female) were enrolled. Sample mean T score on the SCI-QOL Resilience measure was 48.40, SD = 8.60 (min = 29.4; max = 70.0). The CAT administered between 4 (most common, 41.4% of cases) and 12 (9% of cases) items with the Mean(#items) = 5.73, SD = 2.45. The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT scores were normally distributed, with very low ceiling (0%) and floor (3%) effects. The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT had a reliability of 0.89, and the mean length of time for respondents to complete the SCI-QOL Resilience CAT was 44.34 s. SCI-QOL Resilience CAT validity was supported by significant moderate correlations with pain acceptance, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, positive affect and well-being, and pain interference (convergent validity) and small non-significant correlations with age, sex, injury level, pain intensity, mobility level, and years since injury (discriminant validity). CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity. The CAT administration characteristics were impressive: With few items (low response burden), the scale achieved good reliability.

AB  - Background: A comprehensive, reliable, and valid measurement system is needed to monitor changes in children with neurological conditions who experience lifelong functional limitations. Objective. This article describes the development and psychometric properties of the pediatric version of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) measurement system. Methods: The pediatric Neuro-QOL consists of generic and targeted measures. Literature review, focus groups, individual interviews, cognitive interviews of children and consensus meetings were used to identify and finalize relevant domains and item content. Testing was conducted on 1018 children aged 10 to 17 years drawn from the US general population for generic measures and 171 similarly aged children with muscular dystrophy or epilepsy for targeted measures. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor analytic methods. For unidimensional domains, item parameters were estimated using item response theory models. Measures with acceptable fit indices were calibrated as item banks; those without acceptable fit indices were treated as summary scales. Results: Ten measures were developed: 8 generic or targeted banks (anxiety, depression, anger, interaction with peers, fatigue, pain, applied cognition, and stigma) and 2 generic scales (upper and lower extremity function). The banks reliably (r > 0.90) measured 63.2% to 100% of the children tested. Conclusions: The pediatric Neuro-QOL is a comprehensive measurement system with acceptable psychometric properties that could be used in computerized adaptive testing. The next step is to validate these measures in various clinical populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Organizations are increasingly using computerized tests (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in selection systems. A 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil--computerized) <c3><97> 2 (technical level of the job: high technical job--low technical job) <c3><97> 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design was used to assess proposed relationships between reactions to tests, their antecedents, and their consequences. While test-takers' post-test perceptions did not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, computer anxiety and experience with computing were important factors in performing successfully. Significant relationships were found between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing computerized selection tools.

AB  - In spite of the diversity of practices in personnel recruiting and selection (PRS), a tendency to use current technologies is becoming more and more a practice both for automation of psychological assessment actions and for off-site and on-request assessment (24<c3><97>7). New tests embodying enriched items or virtual reality simulations together with classical methods such as adaptive tests, change practice scenarios and pose academic challenges. Videoconference interviews are of particular interest because of the ubiquity of interviews in personnel recruitment and selection. All these changes in techniques and methods need research and reflection. This paper presents a synopsis of current knowledge coming both from literature and from professional practice. It is a radical situation that affects by and large both strategies and relations with candidates. The kernel is to achieve the effectiveness of PRS processes within established ethical and deontological limits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To describe crossâ€sectional and longitudinal variation in neurorehabilitation content provided to young people after severe paediatric acquired brain injury (pABI) and to relate this to observed functional recovery. Method: This was an observational study in a cohort of admissions to a residential neurorehabilitation centre. Recovery was described using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disabilityâ€”Computer Adaptive Testing instrument. Rehabilitation content was measured using the recently described Paediatric Rehabilitation Ingredients Measure (PRISM) and examined using multidimensional scaling. Results: The PRISM reveals wide variation in rehabilitation content between and during admissions primarily reflecting proportions of child active practice, child emotional support, and other management of body structure and function. Rehabilitation content is predicted by preâ€admission recovery, suggesting therapist decisions in designing rehabilitation programmes are shaped by their initial expectations of recovery. However, significant correlations persist between plausiblyâ€related aspects of delivered therapy and observed postâ€admission recovery after adjusting for such effects. Interpretation: The PRISM approach to the analysis of rehabilitation content shows promise in that it demonstrates significant correlations between plausiblyâ€related aspects of delivered therapy and observed recovery that have been hard to identify with other approaches. However, rigorous, causal analysis will be required to truly understand the contributions of rehabilitation to recovery after pABI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the current environment of federally mandated high-stakes testing, teachers and schools are under great pressure to ensure that students demonstrate proficiency on state assessments. Without formative feedback that connects what a teacher did in the classroom with positive outcomes on the state assessment, a teacher may not feel that he or she can make a difference in how students fare on the state assessment. Teachers who experience low self-efficacy use less effective teaching techniques, and this affects student learning. Many schools are now using computer adaptive testing, such as the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA-MAP), to provide teachers with formative information to use for instructional improvement. When adjustments to instruction result in higher student achievement, it can provide the teacher with mastery experiences that increase the teacher's efficacy perceptions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teachers' efficacy beliefs for making a difference in their students' performances on the state assessment and teachers' uses of NWEA-MAP test results. Teachers were surveyed using four measures of teacher efficacy and collective teacher efficacy. Two measures that were created for this study demonstrated high reliability with the study sample and correlated well with the two existing scales. Data were also collected on the ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information and the number of different ways they used score information. The results indicated that the number of ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information made a significant difference in teachers' scores on the efficacy measures: Using score information in three or four different ways was associated with the highest scores on the efficacy scales. Also, using test score information to set goals with students and to individualize instruction predicted teachers' efficacy scores to a greater degree than did using scores to adjust curriculum and instruction. The current study, with its two new measures and its suggestions of relationships between variables, provides a starting point for new lines of research in sources of teacher efficacy beliefs.

AB  - Objective: The Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) is a patient-reported outcome measurement system that is specific to caregivers of civilians and service members/veterans (SMVs) with traumatic brain injury (TBI). This measurement system includes 26 item banks that represent both generic (i.e., borrowed from existing measurement systems) and caregiver-specific components of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This report provides reliability and validity data for measures within the TBI-CareQOL that have not previously been reported (i.e., 4 caregiver-specific and 7 generic measures of HRQOL). Design: Three hundred eighty-five caregivers of persons with TBI completed caregiver-specific computer adaptive tests (CATs) for Feelings of Loss-Self, Caregiver Strain, Caregiver-Specific Anxiety, and Feeling Trapped, as well as generic measures of HRQOL from complementary measurement systems (i.e., Neuro-QoL Positive Affect and Well-Being; PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment; NIH Toolbox Perceived Stress, General Life Satisfaction, and Self Efficacy; TBI-QOL Resilience and Grief/Loss). Caregivers also completed several additional measures to establish convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the Mayo Portland Adaptability Index, 4th ed. Results: Findings support the internal consistency reliability (all alphas > .85) and test-retest stability (all alphas >.73) of the TBI-CareQOL measures. Convergent validity was supported by moderate to high correlations between the TBI-CareQOL measures and related measures, whereas discriminant validity was supported by low correlations between the TBI-CareQOL measures and unrelated constructs. Known-groups validity was also supported. Conclusions: Findings support the reliability and validity of the item banks that comprise the TBI-CareQOL Measurement System. These measures should be considered for any standardized assessment of HRQOL in caregivers of civilians and SMVs with TBI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the past decade, some paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests have been replaced by computerized adaptive testing (CAT) within many large-scale standardized testing programs. However, many researches and applications on CAT had limitations because most of the CAT did not allow examinees to review and change their answers. Among the operative CAT applications, there was only one that incorporated item review. Not allowing examinees to review and change their answers would result in test pressure and affect their performances. Moreover, a majority of examinees manifested a clear preference for item review because they believed that the inclusion of item review made the test fairer and considered it to be a disadvantage if review was disallowed. The CAT test organizers did not allow examinees to review and change answers mainly because they were apprehensive that examinees would use the deceptive Wainer strategy in the review stage to obtain positively biased ability estimates, consequently affecting the fairness and precision of the test. If we could provide a solution that not only allowed examinees to review and change answers but that was also able to deal with the Wainer strategy, the meaning would be great for the development of CAT. Until now, there have been few relevant studies on this topic worldwide. Moreover, the previous studies had a nonnegligible disadvantage, in that the researchers only recorded the answers of the review stage and used them as a basis for scoring, without considering the answers of the adaptive stage. We assumed that comprehensively considering the answers before and after review could produce a more accurate ability estimation. Therefore, this paper employed a new scoring method and attempted to deal with the Wainer strategy: V<ce><b1>j = Beta <c3><97> U<ce><b1>j + (1 <e2><88><92> Beta) <c3><97> U<ce><b1>, j + m This study involved two experiments. Experiment 1 used the Monte Carlo method to simulate the entire process of CAT that allows the reviewing and changing of answers, with the aim of investigating the influence of different beta values on ability estimation. Experiment 2 used simulation data generated by the Monte Carlo method to evaluate the effectiveness of the Wainer strategy and attempted to deal with the strategy by using a new scoring method. The simulation results of Experiment 1 indicated the following. First, comprehensively considering the answers before and after review did produce a more accurate ability estimation, and the most accurate estimates occurred when beta = 0.50. Second, the share of examinees who changed their answers was 66.80%; further, 6.40% of the answers were changed, and 75% of the modified answers represented changes from incorrect to correct answers. Experiment 2 indicated the following: When using the new scoring method, the ability estimates generated by the CAT involving the use of the Wainer strategy obviously diverged from the true ability values. Moreover, the bias increased as the true ability value increased. The new scoring method employed in this study was not able to effectively deal with the Wainer strategy because of the abnormal ability estimates and abnormal estimated standard error. However, through a simulation experiment, we found the following: When beta = 0, comprehensively considering the expected a posteriori (EAP) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) ability estimates of CAT involving the use of the Wainer strategy succeeded in roughly dealing with the Wainer strategy. Our future task involves developing a more accurate method to deal with the Wainer Strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The majority of persons with Huntington disease (HD) experience mental health symptoms. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are capable of capturing unobservable behaviors and feelings relating to mental health. The current study aimed to test the reliability and responsiveness to self-reported and clinician-rated change over time of Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs over the course of a 24-month period. Methods: At baseline, 12-months, and 24-months, 362 participants with premanifest or manifest HD completed the Neuro-QoL Depression computer adaptive test (CAT), PROMIS Depression short form (SF), Neuro-QoL Anxiety CAT, PROMIS Anxiety SF, PROMIS Anger CAT and SF, Neuro-QoL Emotional/Behavioral Dyscontrol CAT and SF, Neuro-QoL Positive Affect and Well-Being CAT and SF, and Neuro-QoL Stigma CAT and SF. Participants completed several clinician-administered measures at each time point, as well as several global ratings of change at 12- and 24-months. Reliability (test-retest reliability and measurement error) and responsiveness (using standardized response means and general linear models) were assessed. Results: Test-retest reliability and measurement error were excellent for all PROs (all ICC <e2><89><a5> .90 for test-retest reliability and all SEM percentages <e2><89><a4> 6.82%). In addition, 12- and 24-month responsiveness were generally supported for the Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs; findings relative to clinician-rated anchors of change (e.g., SRMs for the group with declines ranged from .38 to .91 for 24-month change and .09 to .45, with the majority above .25 for 12-month change) were generally more robust than those relative to self-reported anchors of change (e.g., SRMs for the group with declines ranged from .02 to .75, with the majority above .39 for 24-month change and .09 to .45, with the majority above .16 for 12-month change). Conclusions: The Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs demonstrated strong psychometric reliability, as well as responsiveness to self-reported and clinician-rated change over time in people with HD.

AB  - Reviews the book, Computerized Multistage Testing: Theory and Applications by D. Yan, A. A. von Davier, and C. Lewis (2014). This book presents multistage testing (MST), a useful methodology for the design and administration of adaptive tests that exhibits several practical advantages over traditional computerized adaptive testing. The book mirrors the process of developing and implementing an MST from beginning to end. It takes into consideration the decisions that need to be made at each step including the questions that need to be considered in the decision-making process, as well as the various methodologies that exist to implement the MST design chosen. The authors succeed in merging theoretical concepts with the operational and implementation aspects of MST, making the reading fruitful and motivating. The strength of the book is that it addresses the needs of practitioners in the testing industry, while still remaining theoretical enough to be of interest to graduate students and scientific researchers.

AB  - Compared results obtained from computer-adaptive (CAT) and self-adaptive tests (SAT) under conditions in which item review was permitted and not permitted. 379 college students completed a test anxiety inventory, one form of a computerized vocabulary test (CAT or SAT), and questionnaires assessing demographic information and attitudes about computerized tests. Comparisons of answers before and after review within the 'review' condition showed that a small percentage of answers was changed, that more answers were changed from wrong to right than from right to wrong, that most Ss changed answers to at least some questions, and that most Ss who changed answers improved their ability estimates by doing so.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether school readiness differs between children born <30 weeks' gestation who are classified as at risk for developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and those who are not. METHODS: This study was a prospective cohort study of children born <30 weeks' gestation. Children were classified as at risk for DCD at a corrected age of 4 to 5 years if they scored <16th centile on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition (MABC-2), had a full scale IQ score of >/=80 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV), and had no cerebral palsy. Children were assessed on 4 school readiness domains: (1) health/physical development [Physical Health domain of Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, and Little Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire], (2) social-emotional development (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and PedsQL psychosocial domains), (3) cognitive skills/general knowledge (WPPSI-IV), and (4) language skills (WPPSI-IV). RESULTS: Of 123 children assessed, 16 were ineligible (IQ < 80 or cerebral palsy: n = 15; incomplete MABC-2: n = 1); 28 of 107 (26%) eligible children were at risk for DCD. Children at risk for DCD had poorer performance on all school readiness domains, with group differences of more than 0.4 SD in health/physical development, social-emotional development, and language skills and up to 0.8 SD for cognitive skills/general knowledge compared with those not at risk of DCD. CONCLUSION: Being at risk for DCD in children born <30 weeks' gestation is associated with challenges in multiple school readiness domains, not only the health/physical domain.

AB  - Purpose: Item response theory is increasingly used in the development of psychometric tests. This paper evaluates whether these modern psychometric methods can improve self-reported screening for depression and anxiety in patients with heart failure. Methods: Themental health status of 194 patients with heart failure was assessed using six screening tools for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (9 items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (7 items), PROMIS-Depression Short Form 8a (8 items)) and Anxiety (GAD-7 (7 items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (7 items), PROMIS-Anxiety Short Form 8a (8 items)). An in-person structured clinical interview was used as the current gold standard to identify the presence of a mental disorder. The diagnostic accuracy of all static tools was compared when item response theory (IRT)-based person parameter were estimated instead of sum scores. Furthermore, we compared performance of static instruments with post hoc simulated individual-tailored computer-adaptive test (CATs) for both disorders and a common negative affect CAT. Results: In general, screening for depression was highly efficient and showed a better performance than screening for anxiety with only minimal differences among the assessed instruments. IRT-based person parameters yielded the same diagnostic accuracy as sum scores. CATs showed similar screening performance compared to legacy instruments but required significantly fewer items to identify patients without mental conditions. Ideal cutoffs varied between male and female samples. Conclusions: Overall, the diagnostic performance of all investigated instruments was similar, regardless of the methods being used.However,CATs can individually tailor the test to each patient, thus significantly decreasing the respondent burden for patients with and without mental conditions. Such approach could efficiently increase the acceptability ofmental health screening in clinical practice settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In self-adapted testing (SAT), examinees choose the difficulty of each item they attempt immediately before it is presented. In this article, the author reviews the rationale for investigating SAT and research exploring the effects of SAT on ability estimates, precision and efficiency, mechanisms underlying the effects associated with SAT, and examinee reactions to SAT. Some of the research demonstrates that SAT leads to higher ability estimates than computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whereas other research demonstrated no main effect of test administration mode but that SAT leads to ability estimates that are less influenced by extraneous attributes of the examinee (e.g., test anxiety). SAT is less efficient than CAT, but more efficient than fixed-item testing. Examinees strongly endorse the main elements of SAT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We conducted an experiment that contrasted a variant of computerized adaptive testing, self-adapted testing, with two traditional tests, a relatively difficult one and a relatively easy one, that were constructed from the same bank of verbal ability items. In a self-adapted test, the examinee, rather than a computerized algorithm, chooses the difficulty of the next item to be presented. Participants completed a self-report of text anxiety and were randomly assigned to take one of the three tests of verbal ability. Analyses of variance using Rasch estimates of ability and the standard error of those estimates as dependent measures demonstrated that the self-adapted test led to higher ability estimates and minimized the effect of test anxiety without any overall loss of measurement precision. Analysis of the item choices in the self-adapted test suggested that, in general, participants chose more difficult items as the test progressed. Anxiety was negatively associated with the difficulty of the initial choice but not associated with the rate of progress to higher difficulty items.

AB  - Self-report scales that measure the severity of common mental disorders (e.g., unipolar depression and anxiety disorders) based on subjective signs and symptoms have formed the cornerstone of assessment in clinical psychology and psychiatry for many years. This chapter aims to provide a broad overview of existing, widely used, self-report scales for assessing the presence and frequency of symptoms of depression and anxiety. It focuses on some of the more widely used scales in research and clinical settings with specific reference to their psychometric properties and cross-cultural applicability. The chapter discusses emerging methods that apply modem psychometric techniques to develop the next generation of self-report scales, with the aim of improving the reliability, validity, and comparability of self-report data, while minimizing respondent burden and increasing efficiency via electronic administration. It focuses on three applications of modern test theory to the self-report assessment of mental disorders: item banking, adaptive testing and data-driven short scales, and scale equating. The chapter outlines the strengths and some current criticisms of these techniques and highlights future directions for research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate advanced psychometric properties of the 15-item Economic Strain and Resilience in Cancer (ENRICh) measure of financial toxicity for cancer patients. METHODS: We surveyed 515 cancer patients in the greater Houston metropolitan area using ENRICh from March 2019 to March 2020. We conducted a series of factor analyses alongside parametric and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) assessments using Mokken analysis and the graded response model (GRM). We utilized parameters derived from the GRM to run a simulated computerized adaptive test (CAT) assessment. RESULTS: Among participants, mean age was 58.49 years and 278 (54%) were female. The initial round factor analysis results suggested a one-factor scale structure. Negligible levels of differential item functioning (DIF) were evident between eight items. Three items were removed due to local interdependence (Q3>+0.4). The original 11-point numerical rating scale did not function well, and a new 3-point scoring system was implemented. The final 12-item ENRICh had acceptable fit to the GRM (p<0.001; TLI = 0.94; CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.09; RMSR = 0.06) as well as good scalability and dimensionality. We observed high correlation between CAT version scores and the 12-item measure (r = 0.98). During CAT, items 2 (money you owe) and 4 (stress level about finances) were most frequently administered, followed by items 1 (money in savings) and 5 (ability to pay bills). Scores from these four items alone were strongly correlated with that of the 12-item ENRICh (r = 0.96). CONCLUSION: These CAT and 4-item versions provide options for quick screening in clinical practice and low-burden assessment in research.

AB  - In a post hoc simulation study (N = 3,597 psychiatric outpatients), we investigated whether the efficiency of the 90-item Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) could be improved for assessing clinical subjects with computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A CAT simulation was performed on each of the 3 MASQ subscales (Positive Affect, Negative Affect, and Somatic Anxiety). With the CAT simulation<e2><80><99>s stopping rule set at a high level of measurement precision, the results showed that patients<e2><80><99> test administration can be shortened substantially; the mean decrease in items used for the subscales ranged from 56% up to 74%. Furthermore, the predictive utility of the CAT simulations was sufficient for all MASQ scales. The findings reveal that developing a MASQ CAT for clinical subjects is useful as it leads to more efficient measurement without compromising the reliability of the test outcomes.

AB  - Advances in statistical methods and in computer and Internet technology have provided the opportunity to develop new instruments or adapt existing instruments measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs). This article reviews the National Institutes of Health (NIH) interest in supporting the development and application of these methods, the process for developing an item bank, the special issues and challenges faced in the creation of item banks and computerized-adaptive tests (CATs) measuring key symptom and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains affected by a disease or its treatment, and the importance of NIH's role in encouraging this research field. This commentary raised only a few of the many complicated and challenging issues that will need to be addressed as we move into the electronic age of healthcare delivery systems. While we may find some possible solutions from the field of educational testing where most of these methods were developed and used, an open and continued dialogue will need to take place about the unique issues we face in health outcomes measurement. With public and private sector interaction and close cooperation, we can meet these challenges and explore the benefits of item banks and CATs for improving healthcare delivery in a multi-ethnic society.

AB  - Item response theory is a modern test theory. It focuses on the performance of each item. Under this framework, the performance of test takers on a test item can be predicted by a set of abilities. The relationship between the test takers' item performances and the set of abilities underlying item performances can be described by a monotonically increasing function called an item characteristic curve. Due to various personal reasons, the performances of the test takers may depart from the response patterns predicted by the underlying test model. In order to calculate the extent of departure of these aberrant response patterns, a number of methods have been developed under the theme 'person-fit statistics'. The degree of aberration is calculated as an index called person-fit index. Inside the computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test takers with different abilities will answer different numbers of questions and the difficulties of the items administered to them are usually clustered at the abilities of the test takers. Due to this reason, the application of person-fit indices in the computerized adaptive testing environment to measure misfit is difficult. When the frequent accesses to the item bank has become feasible, test takers may memorize blocks of test items and share these items with future test takers. Individuals with prior knowledge of some items may use that information to get high scores, in the sense that their test scores have been artificially inflated. FLOR is an index of posterior log-odds ratio used for detecting the use of item pre-knowledge. It can be applied both in the fixed item, fixed length test and the CAT environment. It is a model-based index in which aberrant models are defined in the situation of item pre-knowledge. FLOR describes the likelihood that a response pattern arises from the aberrant models. The present study used the hf plot to access the sensitivity of the person-fit indices. hf plot is a plot of hit rate against false alarm rate. For a higher hit rate, usually a higher false alarm rate is followed. hf plot provides a good tools for comparison between indices by inspection of the speed of rise of the curves. A sensitive index should give a faster rise of the curve. In this study, sensitivity of an index was defined as the speed of rise of the hf plot, which is represented by a parameter hf<cf><84> estimated from the data obtained from hf plot. The present study assessed the stability of FLOR over other variables, which were unrelated to item pre-knowledge. It found that FLOR was stable over the discrimination and difficulty parameters of test items. It was also stable over positions of the exposed items in the test and the initial assignment of prior probability of item pre-knowledge. However, the asymptotes (guessing factor) and the probabilities of item exposure did affect the final values of FLOR seriously. The present study also found that FLOR has a much superior sensitivity over other indices in detecting item pre-knowledge. Concerning about the sensitivity over different abilities of test takers, it was found that the sensitivity of FLOR was the highest among low ability test takers and the weakest among strong ability test takers in the fixed length and fixed items tests. However, the sensitivities of FLOR became the same among different abilities of test takers if items with difficulties matching their abilities were used in the tests. The number of beneficiaries among the test takers did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR. Moreover, in a simulation to test the differentiating power of FLOR, it was found that FLOR could differentiate item pre-knowledge from other reasons of personal misfits (test anxiety, player, random response and challenger) effectively. After the stability and sensitivity of FLOR were investigated, the application of it in the CAT environment had become the main concern. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While estimation bias is a primary concern in psychological and educational measurement, the standard error is of equal importance in linking key aspects of the assessment structure, especially when the assessment goal concerns the classification of individuals into categories (e.g., master/non-mastery). In this paper, we show analytically how standard error of ability estimates affects expected classification accuracy and consistency when the decision is binary. When standard error decreases, the conditional classification accuracy and consistency increase. Given an examinee population and a cut score, smaller standard error over the entire latent trait continuum guarantees higher overall expected classification accuracy and consistency. We were also able to show the interrelationship between standard error, the expected classification consistency, and reliability. Utilizing the relationship between standard error and expected classification accuracy and consistency, we derive the upper bounds of the overall expected classification accuracy and consistency of a fixed-length computerized adaptive test. The lower bound of the expected classification accuracy and consistency is also derived given a number of stopping rules of variable-length computerized adaptive testing. Implications of these analytical results on operational tests are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Differential item functioning (DIF) is an important issue in large scale standardized testing. DIF refers to the unexpected difference in item performances among groups of equally proficient examinees, usually classified by ethnicity or gender. Its presence could seriously affect the validity of inferences drawn from a test. Various statistical methods have been proposed to detect and estimate DIF. This dissertation addresses DIF analysis in the context of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whose item selection algorithm adapts to the ability level of each individual examinee. In a CAT, a DIF item may be more consequential and more detrimental be cause fewer items are administered in a CAT than in a traditional paper-and-pencil test and because the remaining sequence of items presented to examinees depends in part on their responses to the DIF item. Consequently, an efficient, stable and flexible method to detect and estimate CAT DIF becomes necessary and increasingly important. We propose simultaneous implementations of online calibration and DIF testing. The idea is to perform online calibration of an item of interest separately in the focal and reference groups. Under any specific parametric IRT model, we can use the (online) estimated latent traits as covariates and fit a nonlinear regression model to each of the two groups. Because of the use of the estimated, not the true , the regression fit has to adjust for the covariate 'measurement errors'. It turns out that this situation fits nicely into the framework of nonlinear error-in-variable modelling, which has been extensively studied in statistical literature. We develop two bias-correction methods using asymptotic expansion and conditional score theory. After correcting the bias caused by measurement error, one can perform a significance test to detect DIF with the parameter estimates for different groups. This dissertation also discusses some general techniques to handle measurement error modelling with different IRT models, including the three-parameter normal ogive model and polytomous response models. Several methods of estimating DIF are studied as well. Large sample properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies show that the resulting methods perform well in terms of Type-I error rate control, accuracy in estimating DIF and power against both unidirectional and crossing DIF.

AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

CY  - NA
AB  - Nursing programs increasingly use exit exams to increase graduating nursing students' readiness for the nurse licensing examination. These exams prepare students for computer adaptive testing and identify areas where remediation is needed. This study examines an Associate Degree in Nursing program that has shown consistently low exit exam scores causing delays in student graduation, eligibility to sit for the licensing exam, and entry into the workforce. The study was crafted to investigate student perspectives of the barriers to student success on the Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) exit exam. It employed a quantitative one-shot survey design to evaluate factors related to performance on the HESI exit exam, including lack of study time, lack of knowledge despite passing nursing courses, lack of motivation to prepare for the exam, overwhelming stress, poor test-taking skills, and lack of confidence. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that students' self-perceptions of poor test-taking skills had a significant negative effect on HESI exit exam scores. These findings were used to design a project focused on teaching test-taking skills throughout the nursing program. The study and project collectively promote positive social change by providing a means to improve nursing program graduation rates, a tool of great importance in addressing the current shortage of nurses in the United States' workforce.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) study were to (1) conceptualize children's subjective well-being (SWB) and (2) produce item pools with excellent content validity for calibration and use in computerized adaptive testings (CATs). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Children's SWB was defined through semistructured interviews with experts, children (aged 8-17 years), parents, and a systematic literature review to identify item concepts comprehensively covering the full spectrum of SWB. Item concepts were transformed into item expressions and evaluated for comprehensibility using cognitive interviews, reading level analysis, and translatability review. RESULTS: Children's SWB comprises affective (positive affect) and global evaluation components (life satisfaction). Input from experts, children, parents, and the literature indicated that the eudaimonic dimension of SWB-that is, a sense of meaning and purpose-could be evaluated. Item pools for life satisfaction (56 items), positive affect (53 items), and meaning and purpose (55 items) were produced. Small differences in comprehensibility of some items were observed between children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: The SWB measures for children are the first to assess both the hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of SWB. Both children and youth seem to understand the concepts of a meaningful life, optimism, and goal orientation.

AB  - We examined cultural differences in the item characteristic functions of self-reported of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mania<e2><88><92>hypomania in a Latino population taking Computerized Adaptive Tests for Mental Health (CAT-MH) in Spanish versus a non-Latino sample taking the tests in English. We studied differential item functioning (DIF) of the most common adaptively administered symptom items out of a bank of 1,008 items between Latino (n = 1276) and non-Latino (n = 798) subjects. For depression, we identified 4 items with DIF that were good discriminators for non-Latinos but poor discriminators for Latinos. These items were related to cheerfulness, life satisfaction, concentration, and fatigue. The correlation between the original calibration and a Latino-only new calibration after eliminating these items was r = .990. For anxiety, no items with DIF were identified. The correlation between the original and new calibrations was r = .993. For mania<e2><88><92>hypomania, we identified 4 items with differential item functioning that were good discriminators for non-Latinos but poor discriminators for Latinos. These items were related to risk-taking, self-assurance, and sexual activity. The correlation between the original and new calibration was r = .962. Once the identified items were removed, the correlation between the original calibration and a Latino-only calibration was r = .96 or greater. These findings reveal that the CAT-MH can be reliably used to measure depression, anxiety, and mania in Latinos taking these tests in Spanish.

AB  - Purpose: Caregivers of service members/veterans (SMVs) encounter a number of barriers when navigating the military health care system. The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to assess potential caregiver frustration with the systems of care and benefits in the United States Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Method: The TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration measure was developed using data from 317 caregivers of SMVs with TBI who completed an item pool comprised of 64 questions pertaining to anger or frustration with accessing military health care services. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the retention of 58 items. Constrained graded response model (GRM) overall fit and item fit analyses and differential item functioning investigations of age and education factors supported the retention of 43 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM item calibration products were used to inform the selection of two 6-item static short forms (TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration-Self; TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration-Person with TBI) and to program the TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration computer adaptive test (CAT). Preliminary data supported the reliability (i.e., internal consistency and test<e2><80><93>retest reliability) as well as the validity (i.e., convergent, discriminant, and known-groups) of the new measure. Conclusions: The new TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration measure can be used to examine caregiver perceptions of and experience with the military health care system, to target improvements. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact and Implications: There is a need for a measure of caregiver-reported concerns with navigating the military health care system. Given that caregivers are an important part of the recovery process for persons with TBI, it is important to evaluate their perception of services that their loved ones may or may not receive. A new measure, the TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration item bank, was developed for this purpose. It includes a long form (43 items), two six-item short forms (a version focused on services for the caregiver and a version focused on services for the person with TBI in the military), and a computer-adaptive test. This measure can assist the military health care system to focus on targeting unmet needs of the caregivers of those with TBI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) provides improved precision and decreased test burden compared with traditional, fixed-length tests. Concerns have been raised regarding reliability of CAT-based measurements because the items administered vary both between and within individuals over time. The study measured test-retest reliability of the CAT Depression Inventory (CAT-DI) for assessment of depression in a screening setting where most scores fall in the normal range. Methods: A random sample of adults (N = 101) at an academic emergency department (ED) was screened twice with the CAT-DI during their visit. Test-retest scores, bias, and reliability were assessed. Results: Fourteen percent of patients scored in the mild range for depression, 4% in the moderate range, and 3% in the severe range. Test-retest scores were without significant bias and had excellent reliability (r = .92). Conclusions: The CAT-DI provided reliable screening results among ED patients. Concerns about whether changes in item presentation during repeat testing would affect test-retest reliability were not supported. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Entrepreneurship is fundamental in modern society because it represents an important source of innovation, employment, productivity, and growth. While the first theoretical models arose from economic and sociological approaches, psychology provides models that integrate different aspects such as cognitions, attitudes and personality, which allow a more detailed study. The purpose of this paper is to show the main contributions of psychology to the assessment of the enterprising personality. For this purpose, the main models and instruments developed to date were reviewed. The results confirm that the enterprising personality has a multidimensional structure and eight personality traits can be highlighted: achievement motivation, risk-taking, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, innovativeness, internal locus of control, and optimism. From a methodological point of view, Item Response Theory and Computerised Adaptive Tests represent the most advanced and modern methods for assessing enterprising personality. There are currently several measurement instruments available. Future areas of research should be directed at the construction of multidimensional models as well as providing alternatives that facilitate a reduction in social desirability and other biases inherent in self-reports.

AB  - Most computerized adaptive testing (CAT) do not allow examinees to review items because it will drastically decrease measurement precision and bring about extra cheating strategies (Wainer, 1993; Wise, 1996). Allowing item review is essential to make CAT comparable with traditional tests. It also matters in application. Item review enables examinees to correct mistakes due to carelessness, which can further improve the precision of ability estimation. No such option may cause some negative consequences for their overall performance especially in high-stake examinations, such as tension or anxiety (Vispoel, Henderickson, & Bleiler, 2000). Therefore, it is worth trying if allowing item review could alleviate problems mentioned at the beginning (Wise, 1996; Vispoel, 2000, 2005). Several methods have been proposed, including the successive block method (Stocking, 1997) and the item pocket (IP) method (Han, 2013). However, both methods are limited in some ways. Stocking's method does not allow examinees to skip items and requires a large number of blocks which may bring about some extra adverse effects because of frequent decision to go to next block. Han's method can avoid limitations of Stocking's. But it requires an appropriate IP size and may result in high bias in large IP size situation. The present study proposed the block item pocket (BIP) method which sets fewer but larger blocks with a proper total IP size. This method keeps advantages of Stocking's and Han's and overcomes their disadvantages. Two simulation studies of two response strategies were conducted to evaluate validity of the BIP method. Item parameters were randomly drawn from uniform distribution (b ~ U (-3, 3)) and (a ~ U (0, 2)). Each examinee was administered a fixed-length CAT with 30 items. The initial item for each examinee was randomly drawn from 0 ~ U (-0.5, 0.5). For the CAT administration, the Maximum Fisher Information method was adopted to select items. The interim and final scores were estimated using MLE method in most conditions. When responses were less than 5 or when all answers were correct or wrong, EAP method was adopted. Each study contained five conditions: non-review, 1 blocks IP method, 2 blocks, 3 blocks and 6 blocks BIP method. Statistics like BIAS, MAEj and RMSE were used as evaluation criteria. Results indicated that: (1) BIP method had better estimate precision than IP method at low ability level under normal strategy; (2) When dealing with Wainer-like strategy, BIP method was far more precise than item pocket method at all ability levels; (3) As the number of blocks increased, estimate precision got closer to non-review condition. Advantages of this new method and future directions were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A State-of-the-Science conference on measurement with disability populations recommended '...the development of cognitive and psychosocial outcome measures, using computer-adaptive testing...that are low in respondent burden and valid across patient populations,' (Clohan et al., 2007, p. 1537). Following this recommendation, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) prioritized the development of measures of cognitive functioning for individuals with disabilities, noting that measures of cognitive functioning 'have not been developed for systemic application in the field of medical rehabilitation. Cognition is both a rehabilitation outcome and a factor related to broader functional and community outcomes for individuals with a wide variety of disabling conditions' (Office of Special Education & Rehabilitation Services, 2009, p. 37193). From this came the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function project (NIH Toolbox) which provides a comprehensive set of cognitive, motor, sensory, and emotional health and function measures for use in clinical, longitudinal, and epidemiological research. The nine papers comprising this special section of Rehabilitation Psychology reflect the sustained collaborative efforts of more than two dozen investigators working at six sites over the past 8 years. They are an initial attempt to validate the NIHTB-CB in disability samples, and they provide initial evidence that the NIHTB-CB can be used with individuals who have TBI, SCI, or stroke. The articles published here reflect the fulfillment of recommendations made during a state-of-the-science conference in 2007. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors describe the first application of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to personnel assessment in the Department of Defense: The U.S. Army's Computerized Adaptive Screening Test, known as CAST. CAST was introduced in 1984 as a more efficient alternative to a paper-and-pencil test, the Enlistment Screening Test. The purpose of both tests was to give military recruiters a means to forecast a candidate's aptitude qualification for military service by predicting his or her score on the Armed Forces Qualification Test composite of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. Knowing who is likely to qualify for enlistment results in more efficient use of recruiters' time and other resources. The chapter summarizes the motivation for developing CAST, as well as its design, development, functional features and validation. Finally, the authors cite CAST as an example of cooperation among the Services, and provide a glimpse of related future developments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is widely used as an outcome measure in the evaluation of treatment interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In order to address challenges associated with existing fixed-length measures (e.g., too long to be used routinely, too short to ensure both content validity and reliability), a COPD-specific item bank (COPD-SIB) was developed. Methods: Items were selected based on literature review and interviews with Dutch COPD patients, with a strong focus on both content validity and item comprehension. The psychometric quality of the item bank was evaluated using Mokken Scale Analysis and parametric Item Response Theory, using data of 666 COPD patients. Results: The final item bank contains 46 items that form a strong scale, tapping into eight important themes that were identified based on literature review and patient interviews: Coping with disease/symptoms, adaptability; Autonomy; Anxiety about the course/end-state of the disease, hopelessness; Positive psychological functioning; Situations triggering or enhancing breathing problems; Symptoms; Activity; Impact. Conclusions: The 46-item COPD-SIB has good psychometric properties and content validity. Items are available in Dutch and English. The COPD-SIB can be used as a stand-alone instrument, or to inform computerised adaptive testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A series of static and adaptive screeners for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were developed and compared using dataâ€driven methods to facilitate the measurement of each disorder in community samples. Data comprised 3175 respondents for the development sample and 3755 respondents for the validation sample, recruited independently using Facebook advertising. Item Response Theory (IRT) was utilized to develop static continuous screeners and to simulate computerized adaptive algorithms. The screeners consisted of a small subset of items from each bank (79% reduction in items for panic disorder, 85% reduction in items for SAD, and 84% reduction in items for OCD) that provided similar scores (r = 0.88â€“0.96). Both static and adaptive screeners were valid with respect to existing scales that purportedly measure similar constructs (r > 0.70 for panic disorder, r > 0.76 for SAD, and r > 0.68 for OCD). The adaptive scales were able to maintain a higher level of precision in comparison to the static scales and evidenced slightly higher concordance with scores generated by the full item banks. The screeners for panic disorder, SAD, and OCD could be used as a flexible approach to measure and monitor the severity of psychopathology in tailored treatment protocols.

AB  - This chapter describes the development and validation of a system for selecting entry-level computer programmers at a large financial services corporation. An important component of the selection system is a computer adaptive test (CAT). The practical and psychometric reasons for choosing an adaptive testing format are described, the reasoning behind the choices is emphasized, and the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved is discussed. In the selection system, the adaptive test was combined with a biodata form and with a semistructured, behavior-oriented interview to maximize the criterion variance predicted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) A newly commissioned math reasoning ability test was used as the basis for the adaptive test. The chapter includes a discussion of how incumbent computer programmers were used to calibrate the item pool and to conduct a concurrent validity study. Given its intended use, the authors paid particular attention to issues relating to how the content of the test could be kept secure, how an adaptive test might affect applicants' reactions to the organization, and keeping the time needed to complete the test to an acceptable amount while providing examinees with enough time to answer.

AB  - This dissertation focused on the generation and evaluation of web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Memory and spatial visualization theory were explored in relation to the addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component. Analysis of the data determined that there was a significant difference between scores on the MRT Computer and MRT Memory test. The addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component did significantly affect results at the .05 alpha level. Reliability and discrimination estimates were higher on the MRT Memory version. The computerization of the paper and pencil version on the MRT did not significantly effect scores but did effect the time required to complete the test. The population utilized in the quasi-experiment consisted of 107 university students from eight institutions in engineering graphics related courses. The subjects completed two researcher developed, Web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the original paper and pencil version of the Mental Rotation Test. One version of the test included a visuo-spatial working memory loading. Significant contributions of this study included developing and evaluating computerized versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Previous versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test did not take advantage of the ability of the computer to incorporate an interaction factor, such as a visuo-spatial working memory loading, into the test. The addition of an interaction factor results in a more discriminate test which will lend itself well to computerized adaptive testing practices. Educators in engineering graphics related disciplines should strongly consider the use of spatial visualization tests to aid in establishing the effects of modern computer systems on fundamental design/drafting skills. Regular testing of spatial visualization skills will result assist in the creation of a more relevant curriculum. Computerized tests which are valid and reliable will assist in making this task feasible. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) continues to gain momentum as the accepted testing modality for a growing number of certification, licensure, education, government and human resource applications. However, the developers of these tests have for the most part failed to adequately explore the impact of individual differences such as test anxiety on the adaptive testing process. It is widely accepted that non-cognitive individual differences variables interact with the assessment of ability when using written examinations. Logic would dictate that individual differences variables would equally affect CAT. Two studies were used to explore this premise. In the first study, 507 examinees were given a test anxiety survey prior to taking a high stakes certification exam using CAT or using a written format. All examinees had already completed their course of study, and the examination would be their last hurdle prior to being awarded certification. High test anxious examinees performed worse than their low anxious counterparts on both testing formats. The second study replicated the finding that anxiety depresses performance in CAT. It also addressed the differential effect of anxiety on within test performance. Examinees were candidates taking their final certification examination following a four year college program. Ability measures were calculated for each successive part of the test for 923 subjects. Within subject performance varied depending upon test position. High anxious examinees performed poorly at all points in the test, while low and medium anxious examinee performance peaked in the middle of the test. If test anxiety and performance measures were actually the same trait, then low anxious individuals should have performed equally well throughout the test. The observed interaction of test anxiety and time on task serves as strong evidence that test anxiety has motivationally mediated as well as cognitively mediated effects. The results of the studies are di (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Explored the effect of reviewing items and altering responses on examinee ability estimates, test precision, test information, decision confidence, and pass/fail status for computerized adaptive tests. Two different populations of examinees took different computerized certification examinations. For purposes of analysis, each population was divided into 3 ability groups (high, medium, and low). Ability measures before and after review were highly correlated, but slightly lower decision confidence was found after review. Pass/fail status was most affected for examinees with estimates close to the pass point. Decisions remained the same for 94% of the examinees. Test precision is only slightly affected by review, and the average information loss can be recovered by the addition of one item. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent research on the psychological effects of different design decisions in computerized adaptive tests indicates that the maximum-information item selection rule fails to optimize respondents' test-taking motivation. While several recent studies have investigated psychological reactions to computerized adaptive tests using a consistently higher base success rate, little research has so far been conducted on the psychometric (primarily test reliability and bias) and psychological effects (e.g. test-taking motivation, self-confidence) of using mixtures of highly informative (p = .50) and easier items (p = .80) in the item selection process. The present paper thus compares these modifications to item selection with a classical maximum-information algorithm. In a simulation study the effect of the different item selection algorithms on measurement precision and bias in the person parameter estimates is evaluated. To do so, the item pool of the Lexical Knowledge Test, measuring crystallized intelligence and self-confidence, is used. The study indicated that modifications using base success probabilities over p = .70 lead to reduced measurement accuracy and--more seriously--a bias in the person parameter estimates for higher ability respondents. However, this was not the case for the motivator item algorithm, occasionally administering easier items as well. The second study (n = 191) thus compared the unmodified maximum-information algorithm with two motivator item algorithms, which differed with regard to the percentage of motivator items presented. The results indicate that respondents yield higher self-confidence estimates under the motivator item conditions. Furthermore, the three conditions did not differ from each other with regard to the total test duration. It can be concluded that a small number of easier motivator items is sufficient to preserve test-taking motivation throughout the test without a loss of test economy.

AB  - The advantages that computer adaptive testing offers over linear tests have been well documented. The Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) design is more efficient than the Linear test design as fewer items are needed to estimate an examinee's proficiency to a desired level of precision. In the ideal situation, a CAT will result in examinees answering different number of items according to the stopping rule employed. Unfortunately, the realities of testing conditions have necessitated the imposition of time and minimum test length limits on CATs. Such constraints might place a burden on the CAT test taker resulting in aberrant response behaviors by some examinees. Occurrence of such response patterns results in inaccurate estimation of examinee proficiency levels. This study examined the effects of test lengths, time limits and the interaction of these factors with the examinee proficiency levels on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns. The focus of the study was on the aberrant behaviors caused by rushed guessing due to restrictive time limits. Four different testing scenarios were examined; fixed length performance tests with and without content constraints, fixed length mastery tests and variable length mastery tests without content constraints. For each of these testing scenarios, the effect of two test lengths, five different timing conditions and the interaction between these factors with three ability levels on ability estimation were examined. For fixed and variable length mastery tests, decision accuracy was also looked at in addition to the estimation accuracy. Several indices were used to evaluate the estimation and decision accuracy for different testing conditions. The results showed that changing time limits had a significant impact on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns conditional on ability. Increasing test length had negligible if not negative effect on ability estimation when rushed guessing occured. In case of performance testing high ability examinees while in classification testing middle ability examinees suffered the most. The decision accuracy was considerably affected in case of variable length classification tests. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Decisions involved in designing high-stakes tests include whether to give examinees feedback and, if it is given, how to display the feedback to them. Researchers have yet to examine the effects of item response theory-related feedback on state test anxiety and examinees<e2><80><99> perceptions of fairness when said feedback is given on an item-by-item basis <e2><80><93> such as during a computer adaptive test. To address these gaps in the literature, this experiment examined the effects of feedback on state test anxiety and perceived test fairness, accounting for individual differences in feedback acceptance, exam performance, and performance goal orientation. These effects were examined across three modes of item-by-item feedback (i.e., text feedback, graphical feedback, and text/graphical feedback together) during a computer adaptive test in an online sample (N = 338). A three-way interaction occurred between text and graphical feedback, test performance, and prove performance goal orientation. As expected, among those who received feedback, there was a significant, positive relationship between feedback acceptance and perceived test fairness. Limitations and future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared easy and difficult versions of self-adapted tests (SATs) and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) among a sample of 187 high school students (aged 17<e2><80><93>19 yrs). No significant differences were found among the 4 tests (easy vs difficult SAT, easy vs difficult CAT) for either estimated ability or posttest state anxiety. Significant differences were found for the number of correct responses, testing time, anxiety change, and standard error of ability. The difficulty manipulation was successful as easy and difficult tests differed in the number of items passed. Conditions with high percentage of items passed produced less posttest than pretest anxiety for both SATs and the easy CATs. In the difficult CAT condition, the number of correct responses was lower and posttest anxiety exceeded pretest anxiety. Results suggest that SAT research should continue to take into account the variable 'number of items passed' as it may hide the effects on anxiety when CATs and SATs are compared. The 2 easy conditions show good psychometric and motivational characteristics. However, the easy CAT gave a higher precision than the easy SAT.

AB  - Abstract Background The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Coreâ€30 (QLQâ€C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQâ€C30. Methods According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases Iâ€“III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included preâ€defined item selection steps and a multiâ€stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. Results On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. Discussion The phases Iâ€“III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to largerâ€scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model. Â© 2013 The Authors.

AB  - We assessed differential item functioning (DIF) based on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to examine how perinatal mood disorders differ from adult psychiatric disorders. The CAT-Mental Health (CAT-MH) was administered to 1614 adult psychiatric outpatients and 419 perinatal women with IRB approval. We examined individual item-level differences using logistic regression and overall score differences by scoring the perinatal data using the original bifactor model calibration based on the psychiatric sample data and a new bifactor model calibration based on the perinatal data and computing their correlation. To examine convergent validity, we computed correlations of the CAT-MH with contemporaneously administered Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS). The rate of major depression in the perinatal sample was 13 %. Rates of anxiety, mania, and suicide risk were 5, 6, and 0.4 %, respectively. One of 66 depression items, one of 69 anxiety items, and 15 of 53 mania items exhibited DIF (i.e., failure to discriminate between high and low levels of the disorder) in the perinatal sample based on the psychiatric sample calibration. Removal of these items resulted in correlations of the original and perinatal calibrations of r = 0.983 for depression, r = 0.986 for anxiety, and r = 0.932 for mania. The 91.3 % of cases were concordantly categorized as either 'at-risk' or 'low-risk' between the EPDS and the perinatal calibration of the CAT-MH. There was little evidence of DIF for depression and anxiety symptoms in perinatal women. This was not true for mania. Now calibrated for perinatal women, the CAT-MH can be evaluated for longitudinal symptom monitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

CY  - NA
AB  - The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System is a collection of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness. The measurement system, under development since 1987, began with the creation of a generic CORE questionnaire called the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). The FACT-G (now in Version 4) is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into four primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. It is appropriate for use with patients with any form of cancer, and extensions of it have been used and validated in other chronic illness condition (e.g., HIV/AIDS; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's disease; rheumatoid arthritis), and in the general population. The FACIT Measurement System now includes over 400 questions, some of which have been translated into more than 45 languages. Assessment of any one patient is tailored so that the most-relevant questions are asked and administration time for any one assessment is usually less than 15 minutes. This is accomplished both by the use of specific subscales for relevant domains of HRQOL, or computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of selected symptoms and functional areas. FACIT questionnaires can be administered by self-report (paper or computer) or interview (face-to-face or telephone). Available scoring, normative data and information on meaningful change now allow one to interpret results in the context of a growing literature base.

AB  - Many organizations provide linear test forms of multiple-choice items or other traditional formats and score them with classical methods. While the advent of the computer has most definitely affected how tests are delivered, in many cases, it is still a traditional test with classical scoring, just shown on a computer screen rather than paper. With the advent of The Cloud, innovation is becoming stronger and faster, offering us more avenues to improving student assessment<e2><80><94>and, therefore, student learning. The core of much innovation is the concept of automation; leveraging advances in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve how assessments are developed, delivered, and analyzed. The rapid increase in computing power and availability of other technological resources is fueling this change, impacting nearly every aspect of assessment from the writing of the first item to the reporting of the final student score. This chapter discusses a number of these aspects and some of the innovations currently under way, including automated item generation, automated test assembly, computerized adaptive testing, and psychometric forensics.

AB  - Calibration errors are inevitable and should not be ignored during the estimation of item parameters. Items with calibration error can affect the measurement results of tests. One of the purposes of the current study is to investigate the impacts of the calibration errors during the estimation of item parameters on the measurement accuracy, average test length, and test efficiency for variable-length cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing. The other purpose is to examine the methods for reducing the adverse effects of calibration errors. Simulation results show that (1) calibration error has negative effect on the measurement accuracy for the deterministic input, noisy 'and' gate (DINA) model, and the reduced reparameterized unified model; (2) the average test lengths is shorter, and the test efficiency is overestimated for items with calibration errors; (3) the compensatory reparameterized unified model (CRUM) is less affected by the calibration errors, and the classification accuracy, average test length, and test efficiency are slightly stable in the CRUM framework; (4) methods such as improving the quality of items, using large calibration sample to calibrate the parameters of items, as well as using cross-validation method can reduce the adverse effects of calibration errors on CD-CAT.

AB  - This study describes the effects of manipulating item difficulty in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment. There are many potential benefits when using CATS as compared to traditional tests. These include increased security, shorter tests, and more precise measurement. According to IRT, the theory underlying CAT, as the computer continually recalculates ability, items that match that current estimate of ability are administered. Such items provide maximum information about examinees during the test. Herein, however, lies a potential problem. These optimal CAT items result in an examinee having only a 50% chance of a correct response. Some examinees may consider such items unduly challenging. Further, when test anxiety is a factor, it is possible that test scores may be negatively affected. This research was undertaken to determine the effects of administering easier CAT items on ability estimation and test length using computer simulations. Also considered was the administration of different numbers of initial items prior to the start of the adaptive portion of the test, using three different levels of measurement precision. Results indicate that regardless of the number of initial items administered, the level of precision employed, or the modifications made to item difficulty, the approximation of estimated ability to true ability is good in all cases. Additionally, the standard deviations of the ability estimates closely approximate the theoretical levels of precision used as stopping rules for the simulated CATs. Since optimal CAT items are not used, each item administered provides less information about examinees than optimal CAT items. This results in longer tests. Fortunately, using easier items that provide up to a 66.4% chance of a correct response results in tests that only modestly increase in length, across levels of precision. For larger standard errors, even easier items (up to a 73.5% chance of a correct response) result in only negligible to modest increases in test length. Examinees who find optimal CAT items difficult or examinees with test anxiety may find CATs that implement easier items enhance the already existing benefits of CAT.

AB  - This study assessed the association of anger, anxiety, and depression, and cognitive bias with pain and activity tolerance among patients with a musculoskeletal illness or injury expected to last more than a month. 102 Patients completed emotional thermometers to quantify symptoms of anger, anxiety, depression; the abbreviated Pain Catastrophizing Scale; a pain intensity scale; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test; the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and demographic questionnaires. Controlling for potential confounding in multivariable analysis we found greater activity intolerance was associated with retired work-status and greater depressive symptoms, but not with greater symptoms of anger. In addition, greater pain intensity was associated with greater symptoms of depression and greater catastrophic thinking, but not with greater symptoms of anger. Anger emotions do not contribute to symptom intensity and activity intolerance in musculoskeletal illness. Attention can be directed at addressing psychological distress and cognitive bias.

AB  - An important aspect of the perceived quality of vocal music is the degree to which the vocalist sings in tune. Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test<e2><80><99>s reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.

AB  - Introduction: The PROMIS Smoking Initiative has developed six item banks for assessment related to cigarette smoking among adult smokers (Nicotine Dependence, Coping Expectancies, Emotional and Sensory Expectancies, Health Expectancies, Psychosocial Expectancies, and Social Motivations). This article evaluates the psychometric performance of the banks when administered via short form (SF), computer adaptive test (CAT), and by mode of administration (computer vs. paper-and-pencil). Methods: Data are from two sources: an internet sample (N = 491) of daily and nondaily smokers who completed both SFs and CATs via the web and a community sample (N = 369) that completed either paper-and-pencil or computer administration of the SFs at two time points. First a CAT version of the PROMIS Smoking Assessment Toolkit was evaluated by comparing item administration rates and scores to the SF administration. Next, we considered the effect of computer versus paper-and-pencil administration on scoring and test-retest reliability. Results: Across the domains approximately 5.4 to 10.3 items were administered on average for the CAT. SF and CAT item response theory-scores were correlated from 0.82 to 0.92 across the domains. Cronbach<e2><80><99>s alpha for the four- to eight-item SFs among daily smokers ranged from .80 to .91 and .82 to .91 for paper-and-pencil and computer administrations, respectively. Test-retest reliability of the SFs ranged from 0.79 to 0.89 across mode of administration. Conclusions: Results indicate that the SF and CAT and computer and paper-and-pencil administrations provide highly comparable scores for daily and nondaily smokers, but preference for SF or CAT administration may vary by smoking domain.

AB  - Investigated the hypothesis that the previously found positive effects of self-adapted testing are attributable to examinees having an increased perception of control over a stressful testing situation. 377 students were randomly assigned to either (a) take a computerized adaptive test (CAT), (b) take a self-adapted test (SAT), or choose between taking a CAT or SAT. Results showed that the strongest preference for SAT was shown by examinees reporting high levels of math anxiety. Moreover, highly anxious examinees who were allowed to choose between the test types exhibited higher mean proficiency estimates than examinees who were assigned to test type.

The present study looked at the importance of item feedback in self-adapted testing. Computerized adaptive tests and self-adapted tests were compared under both feedback and no-feedback conditions, using 363 college students. Self-adapted tests yielded higher test performance and lower anxiety than the computerized adaptive tests regardless of the feedback condition. These findings indicate that item feedback is not necessary for the score differences between self-adapted testing and computerized adaptive testing to be realized.

AB  - Examined the performance of learners of Japanese from different language backgrounds, using data from a computer-adaptive grammar test developed as a placement tool. The trial pen-and-paper test consisted of 225 multiple-choice items. In Australia, China, Japan, and Korea 1,600 students each completed 50 items. In this study, data are presented from 1,452 native speakers of English, Chinese, and Korean who had studied Japanese for 150<e2><80><93>300 hrs. Item difficulties drawn from the trial testing were found to be quite different for the 3 groups of test-takers. This has implications for the validity of using computer-adaptive tests: When actual test-takers are from a background different from that of the trial population, not only may the test fail to measure such test-takers accurately in that unacceptable percentages of test-takers are found to misfit, but the measures of ability provided for each of the test-takers and their relative rankings may differ according to the set of item difficulties used. This will consequently affect decisions made about individual learners regarding placement or selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: An innovative measurement system using a computerized adaptive testing technique based on the item response theory (CAT) has been expanding to measure mental health status. However, little is known about details in its measurement properties based on the empirical data. Moreover, the response time (RT) data, which are not available by a paper-and-pencil measurement but available by a computerized measurement, would be worth investigating for exploring the response behavior. Purpose: We aimed at constructing the CAT to measure depressive symptomatology in a community population and exploring its measurement properties. Also, we examined the relationships between RTs, individual item responses, and depressive levels. Method: For constructing the CAT system, responses of 2061 workers and university students to 24 depression scale plus four negatively revised positive affect items were subjected to a polytomous IRT analysis. The stopping rule was set for standard error of estimation < 0.30 or the maximum 15 items displayed. The CAT and non-adaptive computer-based test (CBT) were administered to 209 undergraduates, and 168 of them administered again after 1 week. Results: On average, the CAT was converged by 10.4 items. The <ce><b8> values estimated by CAT and CBT were highly correlated (r = 0.94 and 0.95 for the 1st and 2nd measurements) and with the traditional scoring procedures (r<e2><80><99>s > 0.90). The test<e2><80><93>retest reliability was at a satisfactory level (r = 0.86). RTs to some items significantly correlated with the <ce><b8> estimates. The mean RT varied by the item contents and wording, i.e., the RT to positive affect items required additional 2 s or longer than the other subscale items. Conclusion: The CAT would be a reliable and practical measurement tool for various purposes including stress check at workplace. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Usually, it is assumed that achievement tests measure maximum performance. However, test performance is not only associated with ability but also with motivational and emotional aspects of test-taking. These aspects are influenced by individual success probability, which in turn depends on the ratio of individual ability to item difficulty (ability-difficulty fit). The impact of ability-difficulty fit on test-taking motivation and emotion is unknown and rarely considered when interpreting test results. N = 9,452 ninth-graders in Germany (PISA 2006) completed a mathematics test and a questionnaire on test-taking effort (motivation) and boredom/daydreaming (emotion). Overall, mean item difficulty exceeded individual ability. Ability-difficulty fit was positively linear related with effort and boredom/daydreaming. The results suggest that low ability students may not show maximum performance in a sequential achievement test. Thus, test score interpretation for this subsample may be invalid. As a solution to this problem the application of computerized adaptive testing is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To better understand not only the minds, but also the hearts of key publics, we have developed a more systemic approach to understand the responses of audiences in crisis situations. The Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) model is based on a publics-based, emotion-driven perspective where the publics' responses to different crises are mapped on 2 continua, the organization's engagement in the crisis and primary publics' coping strategy. This multistage testing found evidence that anxiety was the default emotion that publics felt in crises. The subsequent emotions felt by the publics varied in different quadrants involving different crisis types. As far as coping strategies were concerned, conative coping was more evident than cognitive coping across the 4 quadrants. Evidence also suggested strong merit that conative coping was the external manifestation of the internal cognitive processing that had taken place. Cognitive coping was thus the antecedent of conative coping. Although both the publics and the organizations agreed that the crises were relevant to the organizations' goals, they differed on who should assume more responsibility. The findings, although still very much exploratory, suggest theoretical rigor in the model, with room for further refinements to generate what Yin (2003) termed 'analytic generalization' (p. 33) for the ICM model.

AB  - Building an adaptive testing system requires the practitioner to blend basic research (Weiss, 1980) with technology and logistics that fit the situations in which the tests will be delivered (Sands, Waters, & McBride, 1997). In this study, we will consider the research needs of an adaptive testing system that has been developed for use in a number of K-12 settings (MAP: Northwest Evaluation Association, 2009). While many of the operational questions associated with the initial development of this system have been described earlier (Kingsbury & Houser, 1993, 1998), this chapter focuses on issues that relate current research findings to ongoing adaptive test development and administration there is a category of questions that need to be answered through research and need to be answered within the context of K-12 education to be meaningful. We will discuss three questions in this chapter. The three questions that will be addressed are as follows: Can a stable vertical measurement scale be established that allows the measurement of student achievement levels and achievement growth between grades and across years? Can we identify students who are not giving full effort on a test, and how can we use the information if we can obtain it? Can we adapt our tests using information aside from the momentary achievement estimate for the student and the psychometric characteristics of the items? We have chosen to focus on these questions because they represent research questions in different states of done-ness. The question of vertical scales has been answered in some settings and the methodology exists to answer it in any setting. The question of student effort has been answered in some settings, but we know less about the processes for using the information. Finally the question of using additional information to adapt our tests has been asked, but it is far from answered. These questions suggest the range and the direction of future research that might be useful for additional development of K-12 adaptive tests.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing for cognitive diagnosis (CD-CAT) needs to be efficient and responsive in real time to meet practical applications' requirements. For high-dimensional data, the number of categories to be recognized in a test grows exponentially as the number of attributes increases, which can easily cause system reaction time to be too long such that it adversely affects the examinees and thus seriously impacts the measurement efficiency. More importantly, the long-time CPU operations and memory usage of item selection in CD-CAT due to intensive computation are impractical and cannot wholly meet practice needs. This paper proposed two new efficient selection strategies (HIA and CEL) for high-dimensional CD-CAT to address this issue by incorporating the max-marginals from the maximum a posteriori query and integrating the ensemble learning approach into the previous efficient selection methods, respectively. The performance of the proposed selection method was compared with the conventional selection method using simulated and real item pools. The results showed that the proposed methods could significantly improve the measurement efficiency with about 1/2-1/200 of the conventional methods' computation time while retaining similar measurement accuracy. With increasing number of attributes and size of the item pool, the computation time advantage of the proposed methods becomes more significant.

AB  - With the development of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), many new issues and challenges have been raised. For example, as the test is continuously administered, some new items should be written, calibrated, and added to the item bank periodically to replace the flawed, obsolete, and overexposed items. The new items have to be precisely calibrated because the calibration precision will directly affect the accuracy of ability estimation. The technique of online calibration has been widely used to calibrate new items on-the-fly in CAT. since it offers several advantages over the traditional offline calibration approach. As the simplest and most straightforward online calibration method, Method A (Stocking, 1988) has an obvious theoretical limitation in that it treats the estimated abilities as true values and ignores the measurement errors in ability estimation. To overcome this weakness, we combined a full functional maximum likelihood estimator (FFMLE) and an estimator which made use of the consequences of sufficiency (ECSE) (Stefanski & Carroll, 1985) with Method A respectively to correct for the estimation error of ability, and the new methods are referred to as FFMLE-Method A and ECSE-Method A. A simulation study was conducted to compare the two new methods with three other methods: the original Method A [denoted as Method A (Original)], the original Method A which plugs in the true abilities of examinees [Method A (True)]. and the 'multiple EM cycles' method (MEM). These five methods were evaluated in terms of item-parameter recovery and calibration efficiency under three levels of sample sizes (1000, 2000 and 3000) and three levels of CAT test lengths (10. 20 and 30). assuming the new items are randomly assigned to examinees. Under the two-parameter logistic model, the true abilities for the three groups of examinees were randomly drawn from the standard normal distribution [A'^ (0,1)]. For all conditions. 1000 operational items were simulated to constitute the CAT item bank in which the item parameter vector were randomly generated from a multivariate normal distribution MVN (u. S) following the procedures of Chen and Xin (2014). Furthermore, the process of simulating and calibrating new items were replicated 100 times, and 20 new items were generated and the simulation method was the same as that of the operational items. Maximum Fisher Information method was employed to select the following items, and EAP method combined with MLE method was used to estimate the examinees' abilities. Fixed-length rule was utilized to stop the CAT test. The results showed that the two new approaches, FFMLE-Method A and ECSE-Method A, improved the calibration precision over the Method A (Original) in almost all conditions, and the magnitude of improvement reached maximum when the test length was small (e.g., 10). Furthermore, the performance of the two new methods was very close to that of the best-performing MEM for small and medium-sized test length (i.e.. 10 and 20), whereas ECSE-Method A had the best performance among all methods when the test length was relatively longer (i.e., 30). Also, larger sample size resulted in more precise item-parameter recovery for all online calibration methods. Though the simulation results are very promising, several future directions for research, such as variable-length CAT and more complex CAT conditions, merit investigation (e.g., including item exposure control, content balancing and allowing item review, etc.).

AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally-developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adaptive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and a classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators<e2><80><99> responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators<e2><80><99> experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback be solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated the combination of item response theory and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for psychiatric measurement as a means of reducing the burden of research and clinical assessments. Methods: Data were from 800 participants in outpatient treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder; they completed 616 items of the 626-item Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Scales (MASS) at two times. The first administration was used to design and evaluate a CAT version of the MASS by using post hoc simulation. The second confirmed the functioning of CAT in live testing. Results: Tests of competing models based on item response theory supported the scale's bifactor structure, consisting of a primary dimension and four group factors (mood, panic-agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, and social phobia). Both simulated and live CAT showed a 95% average reduction (585 items) in items administered (24 and 30 items, respectively) compared with administration of the full MASS. The correlation between scores on the full MASS and the CAT version was .93. For the mood disorder subscale, differences in scores between two groups of depressed patients--one with bipolar disorder and one without--on the full scale and on the CAT showed effect sizes of .63 (p < .003) and 1.19 (p < .001) standard deviation units, respectively, indicating better discriminant validity for CAT. Conclusions: Instead of using small fixed-length tests, clinicians can create item banks with a large item pool, and a small set of the items most relevant for a given individual can be administered with no loss of information, yielding a dramatic reduction in administration time and patient and clinician burden.

AB  - There has been a notable lack of change in psychological assessment practices over the last several decades despite vast improvements in science and technology. The use of item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) in other testing domains has yielded positive results, but these practices have not gained widespread use in psychological assessment. Research has shown that the item response theory methodology can yield important information about assessments not available to researchers through classical test theory, and computer adaptive testing can result in significant item reductions and shorter test administration times. Thus, the current study evaluated whether a single set of items that measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with differential item functioning less than |+/-0.3| across the three demographic variables of gender, age, and education can be identified. Research has consistently shown that an internalized distress dimension is prevalent in the literature on self-rated mood, as well as in the MMPI-2 item pool. IRT analyses were used to investigate for age, gender, and education bias in a sample of 4,493 participants with 250 participants for most combinations of demographic variables (age [3], education [3], gender [2]). Age, education, and gender bias was most often seen in comparisons for participants in the 60 to 79 year old age group for all three scales. The Welsh Anxiety (A) scale showed the greatest number of items (19) with DIF greater than |+/-0.3|across the three demographic variables. Differential item functioning was most prevalent when there were significant disparities between the two groups being evaluated. Overall, results showed that there were 22 items that were relatively unbiased for each combination of demographic variables. Internalized Distress (ID) had the greatest number of unbiased items across the various combinations of demographic variables, with 19 items showing relatively no bias. These findings indicate that it is possible to develop a computer adaptive assessment to measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with enough items that are free from bias for age, education, and gender. Further exploration of computer-adaptive administration of the MMPI-2 and other self-report inventories seems warranted because of its ability to provide comparable information frequently with considerable time saving for individuals.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which administers only items relevant to respondents<e2><80><99> ability, has the advantage of measuring persons<e2><80><99> ability precisely with considerably fewer items than traditional tests. CAT has been proposed for use in healthcare to reduce the respondents<e2><80><99>, administrators<e2><80><99> or researchers<e2><80><99> burden in clinics/clinical trials. However, there have been few studies in healthcare that have investigated the optimal characteristics of a CAT. The objective of my study was to investigate: (1) the psychometrics of an item bank measuring upper extremity (UE) disorders for CAT use, (2) how different testing procedures affect the ability estimates from CAT, and (3) whether CAT produce better ability estimates than a traditional static short assessment. The psychometrics of the item bank developed by combining items from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Upper Extremity Functional Index were examined by confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis across body part impairments (neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand). Repeated-measures MANOVA was used to investigate the standard error (SE) and bias of ability estimates from CAT with different testing procedures. Structural equation modeling was implemented to examine the correlations between ability estimates from the full test and different CAT structures and the full test with a short form. Further, paired-sample t test was performed to investigate the SE and bias of ability estimates from CAT and a static short form. In general, the item bank was found essentially unidimensional, the generalized partial credit model fit to the data better than partial credit model and there was no significant DIF. The ability estimates from CAT with expected a posteriori ability estimation method was found to be more precise and more comparable to those from full test than ability estimates derived from the maximum likelihood estimation. Further, CAT had better precision, comparability to full test and sensitivity to detect change than a static short form. The findings from this study suggest that UE CAT differ across estimations methods and are significantly better than a short form version. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) provides an alternative to fixed-length assessments. The study validated a suite of computerized adaptive tests for mental health (CAT-MH) in a community psychiatric sample. METHODS: A total of 145 adults from a community outpatient clinic, including 19 with no history of a mental disorder (control group), were prospectively evaluated with CAT for depression (CAD-MDD and CAT-DI), mania (CAT-MANIA), and anxiety symptoms (CAT-ANX). Ratings were compared with gold-standard psychiatric assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-25), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for CAD-MDD were .96 and .64, respectively (.96 and 1.00 for major depression versus the control group). CAT for depression severity (CAT-DI) correlated well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.79), PHQ-9 (r=.90), and CES-D (r=.90) and had an odds ratio (OR) of 27.88 across its range for current SCID major depressive disorder. CAT-ANX correlated with the HAM-D-25 (r=.73), PHQ-9 (r=.78), and CES-D (r=.81) and had an OR of 11.52 across its range for current SCID generalized anxiety disorder. CAT-MANIA did not correlate well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.31), PHQ-9 (r=.37), and CES-D (r=.39), but it had an OR of 11.56 across its range for a current SCID bipolar diagnosis. Participants found the CAT-MH acceptable and easy to use, averaging 51.7 items and 9.4 minutes to complete the full battery. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gold-standard diagnostic and assessment measures, CAT-MH provided an effective, rapidly administered assessment of psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - Background: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) includes five item banks for alcohol use. There are limited data, however, regarding their validity (e.g., convergent validity, responsiveness to change). To provide such data, we conducted a prospective study with 225 outpatients being treated for substance abuse. Methods: Assessments were completed shortly after intake and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. The alcohol item banks were administered as computerized adaptive tests (CATs). Fourteen CATs and one six-item short form were also administered from eight other PROMIS domains to generate a comprehensive health status profile. After modeling treatment outcome for the sample as a whole, correlates of outcome from the PROMIS health status profile were examined. Results: For convergent validity, the largest correlation emerged between the PROMIS alcohol use score and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (r = .79 at intake). Regarding treatment outcome, there were modest changes across the target problem of alcohol use and other domains of the PROMIS health status profile. However, significant heterogeneity was found in initial severity of drinking and in rates of change for both abstinence and severity of drinking during follow-up. This heterogeneity was associated with demographic (e.g., gender) and health-profile (e.g., emotional support, social participation) variables. Conclusions: The results demonstrated the validity of PROMIS CATs, which require only 4<e2><80><93>6 items in each domain. This efficiency makes it feasible to use a comprehensive health status profile within the substance use treatment setting, providing important prognostic information regarding abstinence and severity of drinking.

AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap initiative devoted to developing better measurement tools for assessing constructs relevant to the clinical investigation and treatment of all diseases-constructs such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, sleep, physical functioning, and social participation. Following creation of item banks for these constructs, our priority has been to validate them, most often in short-term observational studies. We report here on a three-month prospective observational study with depressed outpatients in the early stages of a new treatment episode (with assessments at intake, one-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up). The protocol was designed to compare the psychometric properties of the PROMIS depression item bank (administered as a computerized adaptive test, CAT) with two legacy self-report instruments: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999). PROMIS depression demonstrated strong convergent validity with the CESD and the PHQ-9 (with correlations in a range from .72 to .84 across all time points), as well as responsiveness to change when characterizing symptom severity in a clinical outpatient sample. Identification of patients as "recovered" varied across the measures, with the PHQ-9 being the most conservative. The use of calibrations based on models from item response theory (IRT) provides advantages for PROMIS depression both psychometrically (creating the possibility of adaptive testing, providing a broader effective range of measurement, and generating greater precision) and practically (these psychometric advantages can be achieved with fewer items-a median of 4 items administered by CAT-resulting in less patient burden).

AB  - Emotion knowledge in children includes emotion recognition in other peoples<e2><80><99> faces, as well as understanding the internal and external causes and consequences of emotions and strategies for regulating them. To date, there is no measure in the German-speaking countries that captures emotion knowledge in a differentiated but also reliable and valid way. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM) aims to close this gap. The ATEM follows an adaptive design and six components of emotion knowledge. The 32 Rasch-scaled items are embedded in an attractive story and vary in their difficulty within and between the components. In a sample of 581 3<e2><80><93>9-year-olds, the test showed a good fit to a six-dimensional model and very good psychometric properties. In a subsample of 254 3<e2><80><93>5-year-olds, correlations between the ATEM and a measure of emotion knowledge and measures of expressive and receptive language abilities demonstrated good validity. The ATEM proved to be a good measure of emotion knowledge in children.

AB  - There are many item selection methods proposed for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) applications. However, not all of them have been used in computerized multistage testing (ca-MST). This study uses some item selection methods as a routing method in ca-MST framework. These are maximum Fisher information (MFI), maximum likelihood weighted information (MLWI), maximum posterior weighted information (MPWI), Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler (KL), and posterior Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler (KLP). The main purpose of this study is to examine the performance of these methods when they are used as a routing method in ca-MST applications. These five information methods under four ca-MST panel designs and two test lengths (30 items and 60 items) were tested using the parameters of a real item bank. Results were evaluated with overall findings (mean bias, root mean square error, correlation between true and estimated thetas, and module exposure rates) and conditional findings (conditional absolute bias, standard error of measurement, and root mean square error). It was found that test length affected the outcomes much more than other study conditions. Under 30-item conditions, 1-3 designs outperformed other panel designs. Under 60-item conditions, 1-3-3 designs were better than other panel designs. Each routing method performed well under particular conditions; there was no clear best method in the studied conditions. The recommendations for routing methods in any particular condition were provided for researchers and practitioners as well as the limitations of these results.

To examine whether correct answers require more processing time than incorrect answers, 120 male students (median age 25 yrs) living in Germany were confronted with perceptual and cognitive discrimination tasks. The results confirmed that response times for incorrect answers were significantly longer than those for correct answers. The findings support the assumption that timing behavior represents an independent personality trait. The tests used were the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and the Eysenck Personality Inventory Questionnaire. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Within the framework of item response theory (IRT), the authors developed a German version of an item bank, as well as a software application that can be employed to measure anxiety by means of a computer adaptive test (CAT). A sample of n = 2348 psychiatric and psychosomatic patients answered a set of up to 13 standardized questionnaires. 81 items drawn from these questionnaires were considered pertinent to the anxiety construct. Various tests were conducted to ensure the suitability of these items for an IRT-based assessment. After these tests, 50 items remained in the item bank and were calibrated using the generalized partial credit model. Simulation studies conducted on an independent sample of n = 1528 respondents indicate that 6-8 items suffice to measure the latent trait with high precision (standard error &lt;= 0.32). CAT scores correlated highly with scores estimated from all available items (r = .97) and scale scores of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, state scale, r = .93). Within a routine clinical setting, 102 inpatients answered the Anxiety-CAT along with a number of established anxiety questionnaires. The correlation between the Anxiety-CAT and the STAI state scale was still high (r = .60), but lower than the correlations found in the simulation studies. The Anxiety-CAT was able to differentiate between mental health disorders in a similar manner as established questionnaires. The results suggest that the Anxiety-CAT does indeed exhibit the advantages expected from theory, but the results of further studies are needed in order to judge its full potential for research and clinical practice.

AB  - Validated the pilot version of an computer-adaptive testing algorithm for depression (D-CAT) in everyday clinical practice and examined patients' acceptance of computerized test administration. 537 participants (mean age 42 years) suffering from either depressive disorders, somatoform disorders, adjustment disorders/stress reactions, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, and unspecified psychiatric disorders completed the D-CAT and rated 10 statements assessing practical, cognitive, and emotional aspects involved in computer-adaptive item administration. German versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered to test convergent validity. A subsample of 114 patients was additionally evaluated using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results showed a high overall acceptance of the use of the personal digital assistant and of the mode of item presentation. A predefined reliability of .90 was attained after an average of 6 administered items. Reliable score estimates were possible with 10 or fewer items in 95% of cases. Moreover, convergent validity ranged from r=.68 to r=.77. The D-CAT discriminated between diagnostic groups as well as the other measures did. The D-CAT is considered a short and precise measure of depressive symptoms.

AB  - Calibrated a German item bank for the computer-adaptive testing (CAT) of emotional functioning (EF) in cancer patients and tested different CAT versions. The methodology for item bank development was derived from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Guidelines for Module Development. They comprise thorough conceptualization and literature search, a multi-level cross-cultural review process, as well as the field testing of the developed item list in a sample of cancer patients. Data were analyzed using classical psychometric methods and item response theory (IRT) as well as real-data CAT simulations. The development procedure yielded 38 cross-culturally reviewed items assessing aspects of anxiety, depression, and general distress. They were tested in 204 cancer patients (mean age 59.3; 50.5% men). Psychometric analyses resulted in an item bank of 23 items with sufficient fit to a unidimensional model of EF and good content coverage. CAT simulations showed that the item bank is productive for CAT measurement and provides precise estimates with a small number of items. The item bank showed sufficient discriminative power, except for patients with very good EF. A severe floor effect indicated that more items would be required at the lower end of the continuum when aiming at assessing minor impairments.

AB  - Es wird <c3><bc>ber die Entwicklung und <c3><9c>berpr<c3><bc>fung eines Computer-adaptierten Angst-Tests (A-CAT sub 1)berichtet. Die empirische Erfassung psychischer Merkmale erfolgt in der Regel mit Instrumenten, die auf der Grundlage der klassischen Testtheorie entwickelt wurden. Seit den sechziger Jahren bietet sich hierzu mit der Item Response Theory (IRT) eine Alternative an, die verschiedene Vorteile verspricht. Auf ihrer Grundlage k<c3><b6>nnen u. a. computeradaptive Tests (CATs) entwickelt werden, die die Auswahl der vorgelegten Items dem Antwortverhalten der Patienten anpassen und damit eine h<c3><b6>here Messgenauigkeit bei reduzierter Itemzahl erm<c3><b6>glichen sollen. Von den Autoren wurden verschiedene Schritte zur Entwicklung eines CAT zur Erfassung von Angst unternommen, um zu pr<c3><bc>fen, ob sich die theoretischen Vorz<c3><bc>ge der IRT auch in der praktischen Umsetzung best<c3><a4>tigen lassen. Dargestellt wird die Entwicklung der zu Grunde liegenden Itembank. Hierf<c3><bc>r wurde auf Daten von 2348 Patienten zur<c3><bc>ckgegriffen, die an der Medizinischen Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Psychosomatik der Charit<c3><a9> zwischen 1995 und 2001 im Rahmen der Routinediagnostik ein umfangreiches Set etablierter konventioneller Frageb<c3><b6>gen computergest<c3><bc>tzt beantwortet hatten. Diese beinhalteten 81 Items, die in einem Experten-Rating f<c3><bc>r das Merkmal Angst als relevant angesehen wurden. Die Eigenschaften dieser Items wurden anhand ihrer residualen Korrelationen nach konfirmatorischer Faktorenanalyse (Mplus), ihrer Antwortkategorienfunktion (Testgraf) und ihrer Diskriminationsf<c3><a4>higkeit (Parscale) <c3><bc>berpr<c3><bc>ft.

AB  - Examined the sensitivity and reliability of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for the assessment of self-reported anxiety and depression outcomes compared to standard static clinical monitoring instruments. Based on item response theory, CATs are designed to minimize response burden while maximizing measurement precision. Longitudinal data collected for 595 psychosomatic inpatients were reanalyzed with correlation and ANOVA statistics for the purpose of examining three specific CATs' retest reliability and sensitivity to change compared to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Patient Health Quesionnaire-9, and the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. The three CATs have been used in daily clinical routines for more than a decade. The results showed that all three caused low patient burden. They also administered, on average, 5-7 items with similar retest reliability compared to their corresponding static tools. All three CATs also proved to be as sensitive to change as their corresponding static tools. Future research will include multicenter assessments, external clinical criteria, multidimensional CATs, content balancing, and theta-dependent stopping rules.

AB  - Objective: To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test. Design: This is a psychometric study. Setting: The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany. Subjects: A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study. Interventions: Not applicable. Main measures: The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients. Results: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item-trait interaction (chi(2)(203) = 172.59; P = .94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits). Conclusion: The unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

AB  - Item banks are typically constructed from responses to items that are presented in one fixed order; therefore, order effects between subsequent items may violate the independence assumption. The present study investigated the effect of item order on item bank construction, item calibration, and ability estimation. 15 polytomous items similar to items used in a pilot version of a computer adaptive test for anxiety (Walter et al., 2005; Walter et al., 2007) were presented in one fixed order or in a order randomly generated for each respondent. A total of 520 outpatients participated in the study. Item calibration (generalized partial credit model) yielded only small differences of slope and location parameters. Simulated test runs using either the full item bank or an adaptive algorithm produced very similar ability estimates (expected a posteriori estimation). These results indicate that item order had little impact on item calibration and ability estimation for this item set.

AB  - Objective: Computer adaptive tests (CATs) offer a flexible, test fair, and economic opportunity for accurate measurement of anxiety in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The objective of this study was to develop and calibrate an item bank [anxiety item bank for cardiovascular patients (AIB-cardio)] as a prerequisite for an anxiety-CAT in CVD patients. Study Design and Setting: After pretesting for relevance and comprehension, a pool of 155 anxiety items was answered on a five-point Likert scale. Sample consisted of 715 CVD patients, who were recruited in 14 German cardiac rehabilitation centers. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Mokken analysis, and Rasch analysis were conducted. Results: The results of CFA and Mokken analysis confirmed one factor structure and double monotonicity. In Rasch analysis, merging response categories and removing items with misfit, differential item functioning or local response dependency reduced the AIB-cardio to 37 items. The AIB-cardio fitted to the Rasch model with a nonsignificant item trait interaction (chi-square, 133.89; degrees of freedom, 111; P = 0.07). Person separation reliability was 0.85, and unidimensionality could be verified. Conclusion: The calibrated, unidimensional AIB-cardio provides the basis for a CAT to assess anxiety in rehabilitation patients with CVD with good psychometric properties. Further testing in other cardiovascular patients is needed to increase generalizability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluated a newly developed computerized adaptive test (CAT) for the assessment of stress perception (Stress-CAT). The Stress-CAT was developed based on the 2 dimensions stress exposure and stress reaction and on the basis of item-response theory. Properties of the generated item banks were examined in 2 simulation studies and based on the data of 1,092 psychosomatic in- and outpatients. Validity of the Stress-CAT was evaluated based on a sample of 116 psychosomatic inpatients who also completed other established stress questionnaires. The simulation studies and the clinical application of the Stress-CAT demonstrated that scores produced based on adaptive assessment corresponded with scores generated based on all items from the item pool with no differential item functioning effects for age or gender and similar patterns of association with the other administered stress questionnaires. Stress exposure items showed suboptimal measurement precision at low stress levels. Moderate correlations with existing stress measures were found, although Stress-CAT items were primarily drawn from the validity instruments, so that further validation studies are necessary.

AB  - Das Emotionswissen umfasst verschiedene Bereiche des Erkennens und des Verst<c3><a4>ndnisses von den Emotionen und Emotionsausl<c3><b6>sern in anderen Menschen. Die Entwicklung des Emotionswissens findet zu einem gro<c3><9f>en Teil in der fr<c3><bc>hen und mittleren Kindheit statt und h<c3><a4>ngt mit verschiedenen weiteren emotionalen, sozialen und kognitiven Kompetenzen zusammen. In der aktuellen Forschung bestehen jedoch gro<c3><9f>e Unterschiede in der Operationalisierung des Konstruktes. Diese Dissertation hat das Ziel, einige Zusammenh<c3><a4>nge des Emotionswissens mit weiteren Variablen genauer zu untersuchen und ein neues Instrument zur Erfassung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern vorzustellen. Es wird der Zusammenhang des Emotionswissens von Kindern in der fr<c3><bc>hen und mittleren Kindheit mit schulischem Erfolg in Form von der Peerakzeptanz, der Einstellung zur Schule und der akademischen Leistungen betrachtet. Zudem werden die Entwicklung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern mit und ohne Migrationshintergrund, unter Einbezug ihres Sprachverst<c3><a4>ndnisses und ihrer behavioraler Selbstregulation, verglichen. Au<c3><9f>erdem werden die psychometrischen Eigenschaften des neu entwickelten Adaptiven Tests des Emotionswissens f<c3><bc>r drei- bis neunj<c3><a4>hrige Kinder untersucht. In dem ersten Beitrag der Dissertation, der drei Metaanalysen zum Zusammenhang zwischen dem Emotionswissen und schulischem Erfolg vorstellt, ergaben sich ein mittlerer Zusammenhang des Emotionswissens mit akademischem Schulerfolg und kleine Zusammenh<c3><a4>nge mit Peerakzeptanz und der Einstellung zur Schule. Es zeigte sich unter anderem der sozio<c3><b6>konomische Status als ein moderierender Faktor auf diese Zusammenh<c3><a4>nge. Im zweiten Beitrag der Dissertation, in dem ein Zuwachsmodell des Emotionswissens unter Einbezug von drei Messzeitpunkten innerhalb eines Jahres berechnet wurde, zeigten Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund zu allen Messzeitpunkten ein statistisch bedeutsam geringeres Emotionswissen als Kinder ohne Migrationshintergrund. Der Zusammenhang des Migrationshintergrundes mit dem Anfangswert des Emotionswissens wurde dabei vom Sprachverst<c3><a4>ndnis und der behavioralen Selbstregulation mediiert. Der Adaptive Test des Emotionswissens f<c3><bc>r drei-bis neunj<c3><a4>hrige Kinder wurde mit dem Ziel entwickelt, eine differenzierte und gleichzeitig zeit<c3><b6>konomische Erhebung des Emotionswisssens bei dieser Altersgruppe zu erm<c3><b6>glichen. Der dritte Beitrag der Dissertation stellt die psychometrischen Eigenschaften des Tests vor, der bei einer Stichprobe von 581 Kindern angewendet wurde. Die vorliegende Dissertation unterstreicht die Relevanz des Emotionswissens bez<c3><bc>glich des sozialen und akademischen Erfolges von Kindern und verdeutlicht die Herausforderungen, vor denen Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund stehen. Der Adaptive Test des Emotionswissens f<c3><bc>r drei- bis neunj<c3><a4>hrige Kinder stellte sich als ein reliables und valides Instrument heraus, welches die Forschung zum Emotionswissen von Kindern vergleichbarer machen k<c3><b6>nnte. - Contents: (1) Voltmer, K. &amp; von Salisch, M.

AB  - Item response theory is increasingly used in the development of psychometric tests. This paper evaluates whether these modern psychometric methods can improve self-reported screening for depression and anxiety in patients with heart failure. The mental health status of 194 patients with heart failure was assessed using six screening tools for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (9 items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (7 items), PROMIS-Depression Short Form 8a (8 items)) and Anxiety (GAD-7 (7 items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (7 items), PROMIS-Anxiety Short Form 8a (8 items)). An in-person structured clinical interview was used as the current gold standard to identify the presence of a mental disorder. The diagnostic accuracy of all static tools was compared when item response theory (IRT)-based person parameter were estimated instead of sum scores. Furthermore, we compared performance of static instruments with post hoc simulated individual-tailored computer-adaptive test (CATs) for both disorders and a common negative affect CAT. In general, screening for depression was highly efficient and showed a better performance than screening for anxiety with only minimal differences among the assessed instruments. IRT-based person parameters yielded the same diagnostic accuracy as sum scores. CATs showed similar screening performance compared to legacy instruments but required significantly fewer items to identify patients without mental conditions. Ideal cutoffs varied between male and female samples. Overall, the diagnostic performance of all investigated instruments was similar, regardless of the methods being used. However, CATs can individually tailor the test to each patient, thus significantly decreasing the respondent burden for patients with and without mental conditions. Such approach could efficiently increase the acceptability of mental health screening in clinical practice settings.

AB  - Depressive disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and cause substantial harm and affliction as well as reduced quality of life and impaired psychosocial functioning. Apart from the clinical interview, questionnaires represent the most established and economic diagnostic instruments for depression. A multiplicity of questionnaires for depression has been developed across the past decades. However, several studies demonstrated substantial psychometric shortcomings of many depression questionnaires. Thus, further enhancements in this area appear to be mandatory. The present thesis comprises three studies that aim at further improving the quality of diagnostic methods for depression by making the benefits of modern test theoretical approaches, particularly the Rasch-Model, one of the Item-Response-Theory-Models, available for clinical practice. The first study aimed at providing an ample pool of depression items - the basic requirement for item bank calibration. A thorough review of existing diagnostic tools for depression and relevant literature led to a comprehensive compilation of depression items. Based on the relevance judgments of 49 adept clinical experts 157 relevant items were identified. An additional major finding of Study One was that clinical psychologists tended to regard emotional/ cognitive items as more important than psychiatrists while the latter tended to judge somatic items as more relevant than clinical psychologists. However, across all experts items about somatic complaints were considered as not relevant. The second study was the core of the current thesis and - based on the item pool of Study One - aimed at developing a calibrated item bank for depression and evaluating its psychometric properties. Evaluation of Rasch Model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), dimensionality, local independence, item spread, item and person separation, and reliability resulted in a bank of 79 items that showed good psychometric properties. However, a minority of items showed DIF that must be dealt with in all future applications and utilizations of the bank. Thus, CAT applications on the basis of the item bank should incorporate separate item difficulty estimates for the respective groups (e.g., female vs. male test takers) and questionnaires derived from the bank should hold gender or age dependent norms. Study Three aimed at exemplifying how the Rasch calibrated item bank for depression may be utilized by the derivation of two parallel short but sensitive static depression questionnaires that should cover a sufficiently high spread of depression severities with high test accuracy. This major aim was achieved with the development of the Rasch-based Screening for Depression I and II (DESC-I/ -II), a short depression scale in two parallel forms comprising 10 items each. This instrument may provide considerable benefits in retest applications and for screening purposes in mentally as well as somatically ill patients. Future investigations should engage in validating item calibrations and Rasch model fit of the item bank in a larger sample and DIF analyses should be repeated. Furthermore, psychometric properties of DESC-I and -II should be further investigated, including e.g. evaluation of its retest reliability and sensitivity to change, especially in heterogeneously composed samples that realistically reflect the patient mixture encountered by the practitioner. Finally, the adaptive algorithm that accesses the calibrated item bank should be built and evaluated to allow for computer-adaptive test applications. Taken together, the results of the present thesis constitute a psychometrically sound basis for computer-adaptive testing and provide a promising new screening instrument for depression ready for use. If the major suggestions for future investigations on the basis of the current findings are further pursued, a substantial leap towards better quality and heightened convenience for both patient and diagnostician in depression diagnostics is in near reach.

AB  - Introduces the Berlin Numeracy Test, a newly developed instrument to quickly assess statistical numeracy and risk literacy. Results of 21 studies (n=5,336 college students) are presented that show robust psychometric discriminability across 15 countries (e.g., Germany, Pakistan, Japan, USA) and diverse samples (e.g., medical professionals, general populations, Mechanical Turk Web panels). Analyses show desirable patterns of convergent validity (e.g., numeracy, general cognitive abilities), discriminant validity (e.g., personality, motivation), and criterion validity (e.g., numerical and nonnumerical questions about risk). The Berlin Numeracy Test was found to be the strongest predictor of comprehension of everyday risks (e.g., evaluating claims about products and treatments; interpreting forecasts), doubling the predictive power of other numeracy instruments and accounting for unique variance beyond 13 other cognitive tests (e.g., cognitive reflection, working memory, intelligence). The Berlin Numeracy Test is described as typically taking about 3 minutes to complete and is available in multiple languages and formats, including a computer adaptive test that automatically scores and reports data to researchers (www.riskliteracy.org). Construct validity of numeracy for risk literacy is discussed, as well as underlying cognitive mechanisms and applications in adaptive decision support.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative patient-reported outcomes as predictors of functional improvement following ligament reconstruction tendon interposition. We hypothesized that high levels of preoperative pain interference (PI) and upper-extremity disability are associated with lower magnitudes of functional improvement >/=1 year after surgery on the shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) (primary outcome) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Upper Extremity (UE) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) (UE CAT) v1.2 (secondary outcome). METHODS: Adult patients who underwent ligament reconstruction tendon interposition between February 2014 and April 2018 at an academic tertiary institution were considered for inclusion in this longitudinal cohort study. Patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and >/=1 year after surgery. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the magnitude of functional improvement on the QuickDASH and UE CAT. RESULTS: Among 93 included participants, the mean age was 61 +/- 7 years, and 75 (81%) were women. At 2.5 +/- 1.0 years after surgery, the QuickDASH and UE CAT improved by a mean of 24.5 +/- 20.9 and 9.9 +/- 10.7 points, respectively. In the primary multivariable model, a greater preoperative QuickDASH (indicative of lower function; coefficient, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 0.9) and lower preoperative Performance of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PI CAT (eg, less pain interference; coefficient, -0.7; 95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2) were associated with greater QuickDASH improvement independent of potential confounders. In the secondary multivariable model, lower preoperative UE CAT (indicative of worse function; coefficient, -0.9; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.7) and lower preoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PI CAT (coefficient, -0.3; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1) were associated with greater UE CAT improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative patient-reported outcomes may be useful in understanding the degree of improvement that certain patient populations can expect from ligament reconstruction tendon interposition. Those with lower baseline (preoperative) upper-extremity function and PI are expected to derive the greatest functional improvement in the midterm. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.

AB  - Speech comprehension counts as a benchmark outcome of cochlear implants (CIs)-disregarding the communicative importance of efficient integration of audiovisual (AV) socio-emotional information. We investigated effects of time-synchronized facial information on vocal emotion recognition (VER). In Experiment 1, 26 CI users and normal-hearing (NH) individuals classified emotions for auditory-only, AV congruent, or AV incongruent utterances. In Experiment 2, we compared crossmodal effects between groups with adaptive testing, calibrating auditory difficulty via voice morphs from emotional caricatures to anti-caricatures. CI users performed lower than NH individuals, and VER was correlated with life quality. Importantly, they showed larger benefits to VER with congruent facial emotional information even at equal auditory-only performance levels, suggesting that their larger crossmodal benefits result from deafness-related compensation rather than degraded acoustic representations. Crucially, vocal caricatures enhanced CI users' VER. Findings advocate AV stimuli during CI rehabilitation and suggest perspectives of caricaturing for both perceptual trainings and sound processor technology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Computer Adaptive Testing v2.0 (UE), Pain Interference (P-Interference), and Pain Intensity (P-Intensity) in patients treated nonoperatively for idiopathic adhesive capsulitis (IAC). METHODS: The anchor-based MCID, SCB, and PASS were calculated as the change in PROMIS scores representing the optimal cutoff for a ROC curve with an area under the curve (AUC) analysis. The distribution-based MCID was calculated as a range between the average standard error of measurement multiplied by two different constants: 1 and 2.77. Effect sizes and standardized response means (SRM) were calculated to assess the responsiveness of each PROMIS instrument while regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with achieving these thresholds. RESULTS: This study enrolled 115 patients. The anchor-based MCID for PROMIS UE, P-Interference, and P-Intensity was 5.11, 4.16, and 8.16, respectively. The respective SCB was 8.44, 6.65, and 10.05. The respective PASS was 8.47, 7.01, and 10.41. The odds of achieving MCID values in adhesive capsulitis were negatively affected by gender (male), higher forward elevation at the time of presentation, higher pain scores (P-Interference), need for >/= 2 corticosteroid injections, and a concomitant diagnosis of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The MCID, SCB, and PASS parameters for PROMIS scores can be utilized to determine the clinical meaningfulness of patient-reported improvements in these instruments during the nonoperative treatment and as a research tool to compare the efficacy of new treatments for adhesive capsulitis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, basic science study, validation of outcome instruments. Key points * This is the first study to calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) for the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity and Pain instruments in patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis (IAC) of the shoulder.* This study determined the impact of symptom severity, demographics, and comorbidities on achieving the MCID, SCB, and PASS for PROMIS instruments in IAC patients treated nonoperatively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be useful for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts (BLTC) to evaluate the impact of treatment and/or guide shared decision making. Yet, a set of PROMs relevant to patients with BLTC is currently unavailable. In this study, we selected a PROMs set for patients with BLTC. METHODS: Potentially relevant patient reported outcomes (PROs) were selected by psychologist-researchers based on keywords used or suggested by participants of two virtual focus groups meetings consisting of thirteen female BLTC patients with a median age of 50 years. Subsequently, patients were asked to report their most relevant PROs. PROMs identified by systematic literature review and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) were considered in selecting the final PROMs set to assess relevant outcomes. RESULTS: The most important PROs were: insecurity/anxiety (11/12 patients), pain (9/12 patients), fatigue (8/12 patients), and limitations in daily life (5/12 patients). The literature review included 23 studies, which used various generic and disease-specific PROMs, often not measuring (all) relevant PROs. The final selected PROMs set included numerical rating scales for pain, two questions on overall health and quality of life and four PROMIS CATs. CONCLUSIONS: A PROMs set generically and efficiently measuring outcomes relevant for patients with BLTC was developed and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

TI  - There is Little or No Association Between Independently Assessed Communication Strategies and Patient Ratings of Clinician Empathy.
JO  - Clinical orthopaedics and related research
VL  - NA
PY  - 2022
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of care is increasingly assessed and incentivized using measures of patient-reported outcomes and experience. Little is known about the association between measurement of clinician communication strategies by trained observers and patient-rated clinician empathy (a patient-reported experience measure). An effective independent measure could help identify and promote clinician behaviors associated with good patient experience of care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the association between independently assessed clinician communication effectiveness and patient-rated clinician empathy? (2) Which factors are associated with independently assessed communication effectiveness? METHODS: One hundred twenty adult (age > 17 years) new or returning patients seeking musculoskeletal specialty care between September 2019 and January 2020 consented to video recording of their visit followed by completion of questionnaires rating their perceptions of providers' empathy levels in this prospective study. Patients who had operative treatment and those who had nonoperative treatment were included in our sample. We pooled new and returning patients because our prior studies of patient experience found no influence of visit type and because we were interested in the potential influences of familiarity with the clinician on empathy ratings. We did not record the number of patients or baseline data of patients who were approached, but most patients (> 80%) were willing to participate. For 7% (eight of 120 patients), there was a malfunction with the video equipment or files were misplaced, leaving 112 records available for analysis. Patients were seen by one provider among four attending physicians, four residents, or four physician assistants or nurse practitioners. The primary study question addressed the correlation between patient-rated clinician empathy using the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy and clinician communication effectiveness, independently rated by two communication scholars using the Liverpool Communication Skills Assessment Scale. Based on a subset of 68 videos (61%), the interrater reliability was considered good for individual items on the Liverpool Communication Skills Assessment Scale (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.81]) and excellent for the sum of the items (that is, the total score) (ICC = 0.92 [95% CI 0.87 to 0.95]). To account for the potential association of personal factors with empathy ratings, patients completed measures of symptoms of depression (the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System depression computerized adaptive test), self-efficacy in response to pain (the two-item Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), health anxiety (the five-item Short Health Anxiety Inventory), and basic demographics. RESULTS: Accounting for potentially confounding variables, including specific clinicians, marital status, and work status in the multivariable analysis, we found higher independent ratings of communication effectiveness had a slight association (odds ratio [OR] 1.1 [95% CI 1.0 to 1.3]; p = 0.02) with higher (dichotomized) ratings of patient-rated clinician empathy, while being single was associated with lower ratings (OR 0.40 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.99]; p = 0.05). Independent ratings of communication effectiveness were slightly higher for women (regression coefficient 1.1 [95% CI 0.05 to 2.2]); in addition, two of the four attending physicians were rated notably higher than the other 10 participants after controlling for confounding variables (differences up to 5.8 points on average [95% CI 2.6 to 8.9] on a 36-point scale). CONCLUSION: The observation that ratings of communication effectiveness by trained communication scholars have little or no association with patient-rated clinician empathy suggests that either effective communication is insufficient for good patient experience or that the existing measures are inadequate or inappropriate. This line of investigation might be enhanced by efforts to identify clinician behaviors associated with better patient experience, develop reliable and effective measures of clinician behaviors and patient experience, and use those measures to develop training approaches that improve patient experience. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, prognostic study.

AB  - The replacement of existing technology or the introduction of novel technology into the day-to-day routines of higher education institutions is not a trivial task. Currently, many higher education institutions are faced with the challenge of replacing existing procedures for administering written exams with e-exams. To guide this process, this paper proposes the novel technology-based exams acceptance model (TEAM) and empirically evaluates its model structure and usefulness from the perspective of higher education teachers. The model can be used to guide the transition from paper-based exams to e-exams and the implementation of innovative (e.g., adaptive) e-exam formats. The model includes perceived usefulness, computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, prior experience, facilitating conditions, and subjective norm as predictors of the behavioral intention to use e-exams. To test the model empirically, the responses of 992 teachers at 63 German universities to a standardized online questionnaire were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The model fit was acceptable. With 77% (conventional e-exams) and 82% (adaptive e-exams), a large proportion of the variance of the intention to use these types of exams was explained. With TEAM, a highly predictive model for explaining the behavioral intention to use e-exams is now available. It offers a theoretical basis that can be used for the successful implementation of e-exams in higher education.

AB  - A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL(c)) to assess quality of life of children born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance in Dutch children. After Swedish-Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old children, 8/17 items had &gt;5% missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual child's situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in different countries are needed.

CY  - NA
AB  - Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are questionnaires completed by patients about aspects of their health status. They are a vital part of learning health systems as they are the primary source of information about important outcomes that are best assessed by patients such as pain, disability, anxiety and depression. The volume of questions can easily become burdensome. Previous techniques reduced this burden by dynamically selecting questions from question item banks which are specifically built for different latent constructs being measured. These techniques analyzed the information function between each question in the item bank and the measured construct based on item response theory then used this information function to dynamically select questions by computerized adaptive testing. Here we extend those ideas by using Bayesian Networks (BNs) to enable Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) for efficient and accurate question selection on widely-used existing PROMs. BNs offer more comprehensive probabilistic models of the connections between different PROM questions, allowing the use of information theoretic techniques to select the most informative questions. We tested our methods using five clinical PROM datasets, demonstrating that answering a small subset of questions selected with CAT has similar predictions and error to answering all questions in the PROM BN. Our results show that answering 30% - 75% questions selected with CAT had an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 (min: 0.8 - max: 0.98) for predicting the measured constructs. BNs outperformed alternative CAT approaches with a 5% (min: 0.01% - max: 9%) average increase in the accuracy of predicting the responses to unanswered question items.

CY  - NA
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is an established treatment for spastic cerebral palsy (CP). The effects and predictors of occupational therapy's benefit for self-care after SDR in children with CP have not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in self-care after occupational therapy post-SDR and determine whether changes were affected by age, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, and number of occupational therapy dressing sessions. DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected outcomes pre-SDR, at discharge, and at 1-yr follow-up. Paired t tests and regression analysis were performed. SETTING: Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities-accredited pediatric inpatient rehabilitation facility. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three children (GMFCS Levels I-III, ages 4-17 yr) diagnosed with spastic CP who underwent SDR from 2014 to 2018. INTERVENTION: After having SDR, each child received an average of twice daily occupational therapy for an average of 37.3 days. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) and Functional Independence Measure for Children(R) (WeeFIM) were used to assess self-care performance. RESULTS: The mean WeeFIM dressing (upper and lower body) and mean PEDI-CAT daily activities scores from baseline to discharge and mean WeeFIM lower body dressing at 1-yr follow-up improved significantly. The improvement in lower body dressing correlated with GMFCS level and the number of occupational therapy dressing sessions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The improvement in upper and lower extremity dressing and PEDI-CAT daily activities scores suggests that inpatient occupational therapy post-SDR may provide benefits. What This Article Adds: Children diagnosed with CP may undergo surgical interventions to improve their ability to walk. This article demonstrates the benefit of occupational therapy services after SDR to improve upper and lower body dressing skills.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess: (1) the prevalence of mental health and substance use in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through use of a computer adaptive test (CAT-MH), (2) the correlation among CAT-MH scores and self- and clinician-reported assessments, and (3) the association between CAT-MH scores and ED utilization in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment. METHODS: This was a single-center observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED for somatic complaints (97%) from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes were computer-adaptive-assessed domains of suicidality, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We conducted Pearson correlations and logistic regression for objectives 2 and 3, respectively. RESULTS: From a sample of 794 patients, the proportion of those at moderate/severe risk was: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). CAT-MH domains were highly correlated with self-report assessments (r = 0.49-0.79). Individuals who had 2 or more ED visits in the prior year had 62% increased odds of being in the intermediate-high suicide risk category (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.44) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. Individuals who scored in the intermediate-high-suicide risk group had 63% greater odds of an ED visit within 30 days after enrollment compared to those who scored as low risk (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.44). CONCLUSION: The CAT-MH documented that a considerable proportion of ED patients presenting for somatic problems had mental health conditions, even if mild. Mental health problems were also associated with ED utilization.

AB  - A tablet-based language-independent self-test involving the recognition of ecological sounds in background noise, the Sound Ear Check (SEC), was adapted to make it feasible for young children. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment investigated the SEC's feasibility, as well as its sensitivity and specificity for detecting childhood hearing loss with a monaural adaptive test procedure. In the second experiment, the SEC sounds, noise, and test format were adapted based on the findings of the first experiment. The adaptations were combined with three test procedures, one similar to the one used in Experiment 1, one presenting the sounds dichotically in diotic noise, and one presenting all the sounds with a fixed signal-to-noise ratio and a stopping rule. Results in young children show high sensitivity and specificity to detect different grades of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (70-90%). When using an adaptive, monaural procedure, the test duration was approximately 6 min, and 17% of the results obtained were unreliable. Adaptive staircase analyses showed that the unreliable results probably occur due to attention/motivation loss. The test duration could be reduced to 3-4 min with adapted test formats without decreasing the test-retest reliability. The unreliable test results could be reduced from 17% to as low as 5%. However, dichotic presentation requires longer training, reducing the dichotic test format's feasibility.

AB  - PURPOSE: Problems in speech recognition are often apparent in telecommunication situations. For ecologically valid assessments of such conditions, it is important to quantify the impact of real environments including acoustic conditions at a far-end communication device and all paths of transmission degradation. This study presents an automated matrix sentence test procedure based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) integrated in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure and compares the individual effects of transmission degradations with results from laboratory measurements. METHOD: Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in 16 normal-hearing subjects in four test conditions: (a) a laboratory condition guided by a human experimenter, (b) a laboratory condition with reduced bandwidth and (c) additionally reduced headset quality to simulate typical communication systems, and (d) an automated, ASR-controlled adaptive test procedure over a real VoIP infrastructure. Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and "laboratory" conditions, with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures are useful tools to quantify patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment symptoms. Historically used "legacy measures", such as the Scoliosis Research Society-22 revised questionnaire (SRS-22r), are often disease-specific and can be time-intensive. Recently developed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computerized adaptive testing (CAT) measures may reduce administrative burdens and permit more efficient outcome collection within clinic workflows. In an era of medicine where payments are becoming tied to outcomes, we sought to assess the time to completion (TTC) of 8 pediatric PROMIS CAT measures and the SRS-22r in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients presenting to a large, urban tertiary referral hospital were prospectively enrolled into the study. Subjects were first-time survey respondents in various phases and types of treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. In total, 200 patients ranging from 10 to 17 years old completed 8 Pediatric PROMIS CATs and the SRS-22r. PROMIS CATs administered include Physical Activity, Mobility, Anxiety, Depressive symptoms, Peer Relationships, Physical Stress Experiences, Pain Behavior and Pain Interference. TTC was calculated using start and stop timestamps in the REDCap software. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) TTC for each PROMIS CAT was 1.1 (+/-0.9) minutes with physical activity, mobility, anxiety, depressive symptoms, peer relationships, physical stress experiences, pain behavior, and pain interference taking 1.2, 1.4, 1.0, 0.9, 1.2, 1.0, 1.0, and 1.2 minutes on average to complete, respectively. Mean TTC for the SRS-22r was 5.2 (+/-3.0) minutes. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric orthopaedic cohort, completion of 8 PROMIS CATs demonstrated minimal test-taker burden and time required for completion. These findings support rapid and easily integrable PROMIS CATs in clinical practice to aid in increased delivery of efficient, patient-centered care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, cross-sectional study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional status of individuals with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) followed up at a reference center in the state of Bahia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study, which evaluated individuals with OI, based on a non-probabilistic sampling. To assess motor function, the Motor Function Measure (MFM) score was used, in addition to the measurement of muscle strength using the Medical Research Council (MRC) score. Functional performance was measured using the Pediatric Assessment of Disability Inventory, Computerized Adaptive Testing (PEDI-CAT). RESULTS: Thirty-one individuals aged between two and 18 years old were evaluated. The overall score of MFM was 74.2%, and the lowest score was found in participants with type III OI (56.3%). The median of the MRC index was 80. The mobility domain was the most affected in the PEDI-CAT evaluation, with a mean T score of 23.9, (14.2 in type III OI). CONCLUSIONS: Among the evaluated individuals, functional alterations were identified, reduced global gross motor functionality and muscle strength, impacting the mobility domain, with the most relevant findings in individuals with type III OI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) has been recommended for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study compared the content, validity and reliability of seven PROMIS CATs to the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Adult CKD patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min.1.73m2 not receiving dialysis treatment completed seven PROMIS CATs (assessing physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and ability to participate in social roles and activities), the SF-12 and, additionally, the PROMIS Pain Intensity single item and Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI) at inclusion and 2-weeks. A content comparison was performed between PROMIS CATs and SF-12. Construct validity of PROMIS CATs was assessed using Pearson's correlations. Test-retest reliability of all patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) was assessed by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC). RESULTS: In total, 207 patients participated in the study. A median of 45 items (10 minutes) was completed for PROMIS CATs. All PROMIS CATs showed evidence for sufficient construct validity. PROMIS CATs, most SF-12 domains and summary scores, and DSI showed sufficient test-retest reliability (ICC >/= 0.70). PROMIS CATs had a lower MDC compared to the SF-12 (5.7-7.4 compared to 11.2-21.7 across domains, respectively). CONCLUSION: PROMIS CATs showed sufficient construct validity and test-retest reliability in patients with advanced CKD. PROMIS CATs required more items but showed better reliability than the SF-12. Future research is needed to investigate the feasibility of PROMIS CATs for routine nephrology care.

AB  - Our understanding of longitudinal outcomes of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) survivors is limited by the heterogeneity of follow-up intervals, populations, and outcomes assessed. We sought to demonstrate (1) the feasibility of longitudinal multidimensional outcome assessment and (2) methods to promote cohort retention. The objective of this presented study was to provide details of follow-up methodology in a PICU survivor cohort and not to present the outcomes at long-term follow-up for this cohort. We enrolled 152 children aged 0 to 17 years admitted to the PICU in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. We examined resource utilization, family impact of critical illness, and neurodevelopment using the PICU Outcomes Portfolio (POP) Survey which included a study-specific survey and validated tools: 1. Functional Status Scale, 2. Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, 3. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 4. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and 5. Vanderbilt Assessment Scales for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder. POP Survey completion rates were 89%, 78%, and 84% at 1, 3, and 6 months. Follow-up rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 80%, 55%, and 43%. Implementing a longitudinal multidimensional outcome portfolio for PICU survivors is feasible within an urban, tertiary-care, academic hospital. Our attrition after one year demonstrates the long-term follow-up challenges in this population. Our findings inform ongoing efforts to implement core outcome sets after pediatric critical illness.

TI  - The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge for 3-to 9-Year-Olds: Psychometric Properties and Validity.

VL  - 13

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3-9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3-9-year-olds. The ATEM 3-9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3-9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3-9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3-9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional competencies in normative development (e.g., school readiness) and in social-emotional-learning interventions. Furthermore, it is suitable as an instrument for the differentiated assessment of (progress of) children's emotion knowledge in clinical child psychology and psychiatry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Detecting anxiety in oncology patients is important, requiring valid yet brief measures. One increasingly popular approach is the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS); however, its validity is not well established in oncology. We assessed the convergent and criterion validity of PROMIS anxiety measures in an oncology sample. METHODS: 132 oncology/haematology outpatients completed the PROMIS Anxiety Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-A-CAT) and the 7 item (original) PROMIS Anxiety Short Form (PROMIS-A-SF) along with six well-established measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A); Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Anxiety (DASS-A) and Stress (DASS-S); Distress Thermometer (DT) and PSYCH-6. Correlations, area under the curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with Structured Clinical Interview as the reference standard. RESULTS: Both PROMIS measures correlated with all legacy measures at p < .001 (Rho = .56-.83). AUCs (> .80) were good for both PROMIS measures and comparable to or better than all legacy measures. At the recommended mild cut-point (55), PROMIS-A-SF had sensitivity (.67) comparable to or better than all the legacy measures, whereas PROMIS-A-CAT sensitivity (.59) was lower than GAD-7 (.67) and HADS-A (.62), but comparable to PSYCH-6 and higher than DASS-A, DASS-S and DT. Sensitivity for both was .79. A reduced cut-point of 51 on both PROMIS measures improved sensitivity (.83-.84) although specificity was only adequate (.61-.62). CONCLUSIONS: The convergent and criterion validity of the PROMIS anxiety measures in cancer populations was confirmed as equivalent, but not superior to, established measures (GAD-7 and HADS-A). The PROMIS-A-CAT did not demonstrate clear advantages over PROMIS-A-SF.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to interpret a quantitative diagnosis model of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes based on computer adaptive testing (CAT), from the perspective of both patients and clinicians. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients with postprandial distress syndrome completed the CAT model of TCM syndromes and the Chinese version of the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Functional Digestive Disorders (Chin-FDDQL); the clinicians' diagnosis was concurrently recorded. The patients completed this questionnaire again after 14 +/- 2 days. The kappa test and paired chi-square test were used to evaluate the consistency between the CAT model and clinical diagnosis. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of the Chin-FDDQL scores were used to assess clinical efficacy from the patients' perspective. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores and changes in clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores may affect the clinical outcomes of patients with the total scores of Chin-FDDQL (all P < 0.05). There was a correlation between changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores and the patients' clinical outcomes. Different syndrome elements had different effects on various Chin-FDDQL domains, which was consistent with the theory of TCM. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a method for the clinical interpretation of the CAT model of TCM syndromes, including evidence derived from the application. It may provide a reference for future interpretation of other CAT models.

CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the utility of depression and anxiety symptom screening in patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty to examine differences in active symptoms according to patients' mental health diagnoses and associated prescription medications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed 594 patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty at a tertiary practice between June 2018 and December 2018. Patients completed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety Computerized Adaptive Tests in clinic quantifying active symptoms. Mental health diagnoses and associated medications were extracted from health records. Statistical analysis assessed between-group differences in mean PROMIS scores and the prevalence of heightened depressive and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression modeling demonstrated that being diagnosed with depression without medication (beta 7.1; P < .001) and with medication (beta 8.6; P < .001) were each associated with higher PROMIS Depression scores. Similar modeling demonstrated that patients diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed an anxiolytic (beta 8.4; P < .001) were associated with higher PROMIS Anxiety scores than undiagnosed patients. Eighty-six (15%) patients experienced heightened anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Heightened depressive symptoms were more prevalent among those diagnosed with depression (19% without medication, 24% with antidepressant vs 5% undiagnosed: P < .001). Heightened anxiety symptoms were most prevalent among those diagnosed with anxiety and on anxiolytic medication (25% vs 7% diagnosed with anxiety without medication, 8% undiagnosed: P < .001). CONCLUSION: One in seven arthroplasty patients screened reported heightened depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Despite the majority of arthroplasty patients on antidepressants and anxiolytics having symptoms controlled, these patients remain at increased risk of heightened active symptoms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The integration of a web-based computer-adaptive patient-reported outcome test (CAT) platform with persuasive design optimised features including recommendations for action into routine healthcare could provide a promising way to translate reliable diagnostic results into action. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such a platform for depression and anxiety (RehaCAT+) compared with the standard diagnostic system (RehaCAT) in cardiological and orthopaedic health clinics in routine care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Twelve participating rehabilitation clinics in Germany will be randomly assigned to a control (RehaCAT) or experimental group (RehaCAT+) in a 1:1 design. A total sample of 1848 participants will be recruited across all clinics. The primary outcome, depression severity at 12 months follow-up (T3), will be assessed using the CAT Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Emotional Distress-Depression Item set. Secondary outcomes are depression at discharge (T1) and 6 months follow-up (T2) as well as anxiety, satisfaction with participation in social roles and activities, pain impairment, fatigue, sleep, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, physical functioning, alcohol, personality and health economic-specific general quality of life and socioeconomic cost and benefits at T1-3. User behaviour, acceptance, facilitating and hindering factors will be assessed with semistructured qualitative interviews. Additionally, a smart sensing substudy will be conducted, with daily ecological momentary assessments and passive collection of smartphone usage variables. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle with additional per-protocol analyses. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted from a societal perspective and the perspective of the statutory pension insurance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee of Ulm University, has approved the study (on 24 February 2021 ref. 509/20). Written informed consent will be obtained for all participants. Results will be published via peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00027447.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcome measures, especially Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, has increased in recent years. Given this growth, it is imperative to ensure that the measures being used are validated for the intended population(s)/disease(s). Our objective was to assess the construct validity of 8 PROMIS computer adaptive testing (CAT) measures among children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 200 children (aged 10 to 17 y) with AIS, who completed 8 PROMIS CATs (Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Mobility, Pain Behavior, Pain Interference, Peer Relationships, Physical Activity, Physical Stress Experiences) and the Scoliosis Research Society-22r questionnaire (SRS-22r) electronically. Treatment categories were observation, bracing, indicated for surgery, or postoperative from posterior spinal fusion. Construct validity was evaluated using known group analysis and convergent and discriminant validity analyses. Analysis of variance was used to identify differences in PROMIS T -scores by treatment category (known groups). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient ( rs ) was calculated between corresponding PROMIS and SRS-22r domains (convergent) and between unrelated PROMIS domains (discriminant). Floor/ceiling effects were calculated. RESULTS: Among treatment categories, significant differences were found in PROMIS Mobility, Pain Behavior, Pain Interference, and Physical Stress Experiences and in all SRS-22r domains ( P <0.05) except Mental Health ( P =0.15). SRS-22r Pain was strongly correlated with PROMIS Pain Interference ( rs =-0.72) and Pain Behavior ( rs =-0.71) and moderately correlated with Physical Stress Experiences ( rs =-0.57). SRS-22r Mental Health was strongly correlated with PROMIS Depressive Symptoms ( rs =-0.72) and moderately correlated with Anxiety ( rs =-0.62). SRS-22r Function was moderately correlated with PROMIS Mobility ( rs =0.64) and weakly correlated with Physical Activity ( rs =0.34). SRS-22r Self-Image was weakly correlated with PROMIS Peer Relationships ( rs =0.33). All unrelated PROMIS CATs were weakly correlated (| rs |<0.40). PROMIS Anxiety, Mobility, Pain Behavior, and Pain Interference and SRS-22r Function, Pain, and Satisfaction displayed ceiling effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the construct validity of 6 PROMIS CATs in evaluating AIS patients. Ceiling effects should be considered when using specific PROMIS CATs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic.

AB  - Although many studies have been carried out on the psychometric aspects of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), its psychological aspects are less researched. Early studies claimed that CAT can be more motivating and induce less anxiety than traditional fixed-item tests (FIT). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of CAT on motivation and anxiety in comparison to traditional fixed-item testing. Seven databases were examined. Articles were eligible if they employed an empirical study containing a direct comparison between CAT and FIT. Meta-analytical results showed no overall effect of test type on anxiety and motivation when comparing CAT with FIT (k = 11, g+ = 0.06, p = .28). However, easier CAT had positive effect compared with FIT (k = 2, g+ = .22, p < .001). Certain modifications in CAT administration can provide positive psychological effects for test-takers.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of glaucoma-specific quality of life (QoL) item banks (GlauCAT) and assess their performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) simulations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 293 participants with glaucoma (mean age +/- SD, 70.7 +/- 13.2 years; 45% female) answered 342 items in 12 QoL item banks (IBs): Activity Limitation (AL); Driving (DV); Convenience (CV); Economic (EC); Emotional (EM); General Symptoms (GS); Health Concerns (HC); Lighting (LT); Mobility (MB); Ocular Surface Symptoms (OS); Social (SC); and Visual Symptoms (VS). These IBs were assessed using Rasch analysis, and CAT simulations with 1000 simulated respondents were utilized to determine the average number of items to be administered to achieve moderate and high precision levels. RESULTS: The AL, DV, EM, HC, LT, MB, EC, OS, SC, and VS IBs required relatively minor amendments to achieve satisfactory psychometric fit. To resolve multidimensionality, we split CV into Treatment Convenience (TCV) and General Convenience (GCV). Due to poor measurement precision, the GS IB was not pursued further. This resulted in 12 total IBs. In CAT simulations, an average of 3.7 and 7.3 items per IB were required to attain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Following rigorous psychometric assessment, we developed 12 valid glaucoma-specific QoL domains that can obtain highly precise person measure estimates using a small number of items. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: GlauCAT will enable researchers and clinicians to quickly and comprehensively assess the impact of glaucoma and its associated interventions across a range of QoL domains.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Opioids may be necessary for guideline-concordant acute perioperative pain management, but their use carries risks for unintended prolonged use and addiction. Guidelines recommend use of validated non-pharmacological pain care (NPPC) approaches in conjunction with prescribed opioids and other analgesics. Our protocol outlines a population-level, pragmatic trial that will test a bundled intervention comprised of an electronic health record (EHR) portal-based conversation guide, EHR clinical decision support (CDS), and a suite of self-management educational and support materials to encourage and advance NPPC use. METHODS: We are conducting a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized pragmatic trial spanning seven surgical specialties across six geographically diverse locations within the Mayo Clinic Enterprise. Thirty two surgical practices across six locations (Rochester, Minnesota; Mankato, Minnesota; La Crosse, Wisconsin; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Phoenix, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida) comprise 22 distinct practice clusters that are randomly assigned to one of five steps using constrained randomization. Steps "go live" by initiating the intervention at 7-month intervals between March 2021 and July 2023. Patients over 18 years of age who are scheduled for qualifying procedures within "live" consenting practices are sent a Healing After Surgery guide via their patient portals pre-operatively, directing them to identify their preferred NPPC modalities among 13 approaches. These selections create CDS options for care teams to support patients with self-management materials that reinforce safe NPPC use. PLANNED OUTCOMES: Patients' clinical, demographic, and outcome data will be abstracted from the Epic EHR. Primary outcomes will be the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference and physical functioning computer adaptive tests (CAT) collected at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively via the patient portal. We will mail printed versions of the 6-item PROMIS short forms to portal non-responders to minimize bias. Secondary outcomes will include the PROMIS anxiety CAT, opioid consumption, and self-reported NPPC use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04570371.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) have been suggested for use in measuring treatment effectiveness. To minimize patient burden, two approaches have been proposed: An orthopedic-specific Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) or computer adaptive testing methods such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). The goal of this work was to examine the constructs measured by the SANE and PROMIS system in a military orthopedic population undergoing knee surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 732 patients and 2,166 complete observations, the SANE-Knee PRO and PROMIS surveys for Depression, Anxiety, Pain Interference, Sleep Disturbance, and Physical Function were obtained. A correlation matrix between the PROs was calculated, the number of latent factors to extract was determined via parallel plot, and the final principal axis exploratory factor analysis was performed. RESULTS: The parallel plot analysis indicated that two latent factors existed. One latent factor corresponded to measures of psychological distress (PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, Depression, and Anxiety) and the second latent factor corresponded to physical capability (SANE, PROMIS Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Sleep Disturbance). Both PROMIS Physical Function (0.83) and Pain Interference (-0.80) more strongly weigh on the physical capability latent factor than SANE (0.69). CONCLUSIONS: In a knee surgical population, the SANE, PROMIS Physical Function, and PROMIS Pain Interference measure the same human dimension of physical capability; however, PROMIS Physical Function and Pain Interference may measure this construct more effectively in isolation. The SANE may be a more viable option to gauge physical capability when computer adaptive testing is not possible.

AB  - The usefulness of depression scales for patients with cancer based on item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) has not yet been fully explored. This study thus aimed to develop an IRT-based tool for measuring depression in patients with cancer. We analyzed data from 393 patients with cancer from four tertiary centers in Japan who had not received psychiatric treatment. They answered 62 questions across five categories regarding their psychiatric status over the previous week. We selected 28 items that satisfied the assumptions of IRT, fitted a graded response model to these items, and performed CAT simulations. The CAT simulation used an average of 6.96 items and showed a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.916 (95% confidence interval, 0.899-0.931) between the degree of depression estimated by simulation and that estimated using all 28 items. The measurement precision of CAT with only four items was superior to that of the estimation using the calibrated Patient Health Questionnaire-9. These results imply that this scale is useful and accurate for measuring depression in patients with cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Measure quality of life (QoL) outcomes using a novel computerised adaptive test in a clinical setting, and determine the social and demographic factors associated with specific QoL domains in patients with glaucoma. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study between July 2020 and April 2021. PARTICIPANTS: English-speaking adults presenting to glaucoma clinic. Patients with cognitive impairment on a six-item cognitive impairment screen or with intraocular surgery within 90 days prior to presentation were excluded. RESULTS: Of 206 patients surveyed, mean age was 64.8 years (SD 15.2), 122 (56.7%) were female and 159 (74.7%) were white. On multivariable regression, visual acuity was associated with greater activity limitation (beta=-2.8 points, 95% CI -3.8 to -1.8, p<0.001) and worse mobility (beta=-2.1 points, 95% CI -3.2 to -0.9, p<0.001), while poorer visual field (VF) mean deviation was associated with lower scores on the emotional well-being domain (beta=-2.4 points, 95% CI -4.6 to -0.3, p=0.03). Glaucoma suspects and those with early VF defects had higher QoL scores than those with severe glaucoma in the following domains: activity limitation (88.5+/-14.6 vs 74.3+/-21.9, respectively, p<0.001), mobility (91.0+/-12.5 vs 80.0+/-25.3, respectively, p=0.005) and concerns domains (82.2+/-13.9 vs 72.5 5+/-18.9, respectively, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a busy glaucoma clinic where QoL was measured with online adaptive tests for glaucoma, we found that several demographic and clinical variables are associated with lower domain scores, suggesting that patients with predisposing demographic and clinical factors are at a higher risk of worse QoL.

AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in patients undergoing shoulder surgery using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety computer adaptive tests, and to determine the factors associated with more severe symptoms. Additionally, we sought to determine whether PROMIS Depression and Anxiety were associated with functional outcomes after shoulder surgery. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 293 patients from an urban population who underwent elective shoulder surgery from 2015 to 2018. Survey questionnaires included preoperative and two-year postoperative data. Bivariate analysis was used to identify associations and multivariable analysis was used to control for confounding variables. RESULTS: Mean two-year PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores significantly improved from preoperative scores, with a greater improvement observed in PROMIS Anxiety. Worse PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores were also significantly correlated with worse PROMIS Physical Function (PF) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (ASES). After controlling for confounding variables, worse PROMIS Depression was an independent predictor of worse PROMIS PF, while worse PROMIS Anxiety was an independent predictor of worse PROMIS PF and ASES scores. CONCLUSION: Mean two-year PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores improved after elective shoulder surgery and several patient characteristics were associated with these scores. Worse functional outcomes were associated with worse PROMIS Depression and Anxiety; however, more severe two-year PROMIS Anxiety was the strongest predictor of worse functional outcomes.

AB  - We congratulate Dr. Nigel Stallard on his stimulating paper on adaptive enrichment designs with a continuous biomarker. Dr. Stallard details a framework for a large and interesting class of enrichment procedures. His work has motivated us to offer some thoughts in response. Dr. Stallard's strategy is to use the maximum of a test statistic over a set of possible threshold values to define the enriched population to be sampled in a second stage. This reminds us of procedures for identifying a change point, a biomarker value beyond which the effect of treatment is increased. For simplicity we focus our comments on Dr. Stallard's Rule 1 for selecting the second-stage sampling threshold. Using this rule, we present the likelihood ratio approach for adaptive testing and compare it to Dr. Stallard's approach for a few scenarios.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity and reliability of the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Item Bank Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-SD CAT) in patients on renal replacement therapy, using the Insomnia Severity Index as the primary legacy instrument. METHODS: Cross-sectional sample of adults on renal replacement therapy completed PROMIS-SD CAT, Insomnia Severity Index, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised Renal, SF-12 questionnaires. Construct validity was confirmed by associations with legacy instrument scores and measures of emotional wellbeing. Test-retest and scale reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient and standard errors of measurement, respectively. Discrimination was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 217 participants (133 kidney transplant recipients, 84 on dialysis), 15% had moderate/severe sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index >/=15). PROMIS-SD CAT exhibited good test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (0.83-0.93)) and scale (>0.9 for T-scores 34-73) reliability. PROMIS-SD CAT T-scores were strongly correlated with Insomnia Severity Index (rho = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.81-0.88)), Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised Renal Sleep Item (rho = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (0.69-0.81)) and moderately with General Anxiety Disorder-7 scores and SF-12 Mental Component Summary scores (p < 0.001 for all). PROMIS-SD CAT demonstrated outstanding discrimination for moderate/severe insomnia (defined as Insomnia Severity Index >/=15) (AUROC 0.93, 95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.98)). PROMIS-SD CAT and Insomnia Severity Index measurement characteristics were qualitatively similar between patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. CONCLUSIONS: These results support PROMIS-SD CAT's validity and reliability for research and as potential screening tool among patients on renal replacement therapy.

TI  - Developing a Web-Based App to Assess Mental Health Difficulties in Secondary School Pupils: Qualitative User-Centered Design Study.
JO  - JMIR formative research
VL  - 6
PY  - 2022
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary schools are an ideal setting to identify young people experiencing mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression. However, current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools. METHODS: This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cycles-an initial stakeholder consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for designing mental health assessment apps are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Artemis-A is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training. Future research will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Artemis-A in a range of UK secondary schools.

CY  - NA
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), are characterised by impaired development of the early central nervous system, impacting cognitive and/or physical function. Early detection of NDD enables infants to be fast-tracked to early intervention services, optimising outcomes. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants may experience early life factors increasing their risk of neurodevelopmental vulnerability, which persist into later childhood, further compounding the health inequities experienced by First Nations peoples in Australia. The LEAP-CP prospective cohort study will investigate the efficacy of early screening programmes, implemented in Queensland, Australia to earlier identify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants who are 'at risk' of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (NDO) or NDD. Diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of early detection tools for identifying infants 'at risk' of a later diagnosis of adverse NDO or NDD will be determined. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander infants born in Queensland, Australia (birth years 2020-2022) will be invited to participate. Infants aged <9 months corrected age (CA) will undergo screening using the (1) General Movements Assessment (GMA); (2) Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE); (3) Rapid Neurodevelopmental Assessment (RNDA) and (4) Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Aboriginal adaptation (ASQ-TRAK). Developmental outcomes at 12 months CA will be determined for: (1) neurological (HINE); (2) motor (Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2); (3) cognitive and communication (Bayley Scales of Infant Development III); (4) functional capabilities (Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test) and (5) behaviour (Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment). Infants will be classified as typically developing or 'at risk' of an adverse NDO and/or specific NDD based on symptomology using developmental and diagnostic outcomes for (1) CP (2) ASD and (3) FASD. The effects of perinatal, social and environmental factors, caregiver mental health and clinical neuroimaging on NDOs will be investigated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by appropriate Queensland ethics committees; Far North Queensland Health Research Ethics Committee (HREC/2019/QCH/50533 (Sep ver 2)-1370), the Townsville HHS Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/QTHS/56008), the University of Queensland Medical Research Ethics Committee (2020000185/HREC/2019/QCH/50533) and the Children's Health Queensland HHS Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/20/QCHQ/63906) with governance and support from local First Nations communities. Findings from this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12619000969167.

TI  - The promise of computer adaptive testing in collection of orthopaedic outcomes: an evaluation of PROMIS utilization.
JO  - Journal of patient-reported outcomes
VL  - 6
PY  - 2022
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: A crucial component to improving patient care is better clinician understanding of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In orthopaedic surgery, HRQoL assessment instruments such as the NIH developed Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), provide surgeons with a framework to assess how a treatment or medical condition is affecting each patient's HRQoL. PROMIS has been demonstrated as a valuable instrument in many diseases; however, the extent to which orthopaedic surgery subspecialties have used and validated PROMIS measures in peer-reviewed research is unclear. METHODS: Systematic scoping methodology was used to investigate the characteristics of studies using PROMIS to assess HRQoL measures as orthopaedic surgical outcomes as well as studies validating computerized adaptive test (CAT) PROMIS physical health (PH) domains including: Physical Function (PF), Upper Extremity (UE), Lower Extremity (LE). RESULTS: A systematic search of PubMed identified 391 publications utilizing PROMIS in orthopaedics; 153 (39%) were PROMIS PH CAT validation publications. One-hundred publications were in Hand and Upper Extremity, 69 in Spine, 44 in Adult Reconstruction, 43 in Foot and Ankle, 43 in Sports, 37 in Trauma, 31 in General orthopaedics, and 24 in Tumor. From 2011 through 2020 there was an upward trend in orthopaedic PROMIS publications each year (range, 1-153) and an increase in studies investigating or utilizing PROMIS PH CAT domains (range, 1-105). Eighty-five percent (n = 130) of orthopaedic surgery PROMIS PH CAT validation publications (n = 153) analyzed PF; 30% (n = 46) analyzed UE; 3% (n = 4) analyzed LE. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS utilization within orthopaedics as a whole has significantly increased within the past decade, particularly within PROMIS CAT domains. The existing literature reviewed in this scoping study demonstrates that PROMIS PH CAT domains (PF, UE, and LE) are reliable, responsive, and interpretable in most contexts of patient care throughout all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties. The expanded use of PROMIS CATs in orthopaedic surgery highlights the potential for improved quality of patient care. While challenges of integrating PROMIS into electronic medical records exist, expanded use of PROMIS CAT measurement instruments throughout orthopaedic surgery should be performed. Plain english summary In orthopaedic surgery, health-related quality of life tools such as the NIH developed Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), offer patients an opportunity to better understand their medical condition and be involved in their own care. Additionally, PROMIS provides surgeons with a framework to assess how a treatment or medical condition is affecting each patient's functional status and quality of life. The efficacy of PROMIS has been demonstrated in many diseases; however, its application throughout orthopaedic care has yet to be depicted. This study sought to identify the extent to which all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties have used and validated PROMIS measures in peer-reviewed research in order to identify its potential as an applicable and valuable tool across specialties. We determined that PROMIS utilization has significantly increased within the past decade. The existing literature reviewed in this scoping study demonstrates that the PROMIS computerized adaptive test domains evaluating physical function status are reliable, responsive, and interpretable in most contexts of patient care throughout all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties. Based on these results, this study recommends the expanded and more uniform use of PROMIS computerized adaptive test measurement instruments in the clinical care of orthopaedic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious mental health conditions (eg, anxiety and depression) are common in surgical patients, yet likely underassessed due to the time-consuming and cumbersome traditional screening process. A recently developed computerized adaptive mental health assessment tool (computerized adaptive test-mental health [CAT-MH]) allows rapid, precise, and accurate assessment of numerous mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, without the need for a trained interviewer. The goal of this investigation was to determine the feasibility of administering CAT-MH for anxiety and depression in the preoperative setting and to obtain preliminary evidence of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in preoperative patients. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 100 adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled and asked to complete the CAT-MH in the preoperative clinic. Urgent and emergency surgeries were excluded as were pregnant patients. Primary feasibility outcomes were completion rate and time to completion. Secondary outcomes were prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: All 100 enrolled patients completed the study. All patients were able to complete the mental health assessment (mean time: 3.6 +/- 1.8 minutes standard deviation). Sixteen patients (16%) screened positive for anxiety (severity: mild, n = 7 [7%]; moderate, n = 7 [7%]); severe, n = 2 [2%]); 12 of 16 (75%) did not have a previous diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Twenty-eight (28%) patients screened positive for depression (severity: mild, n = 26 [26%]; moderate and severe, n = 1 each [1%]); 23 of 28 (82%) had no previous diagnosis of depressive disorder. Nineteen patients (19%) met the screening criteria for major depressive disorder; 14 of 19 (74%) of which had no previous diagnosis of major depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study support the feasibility of using CAT-MH in a preoperative evaluation and indicate that there is a substantial prevalence of undiagnosed anxiety and depression in surgical patients.

AB  - AIMS: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) has demonstrated faster administration, lower burden of data capture and reduced floor and ceiling effects compared to traditional Patient Reported Outcomes Measurements (PROMs). We investigated the suitability of PROMIS Mobility score in assessing physical function in the sequelae of childhood hip disease. METHODS: In all, 266 adolscents (aged >/= 12 years) and adults were identified with a prior diagnosis of childhood hip disease (either Perthes' disease (n = 232 (87.2%)) or Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (n = 34 (12.8%)) with a mean age of 27.73 years (SD 12.24). Participants completed the PROMIS Mobility Computer Adaptive Test, the Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire, and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. We investigated the correlation between the PROMIS Mobility and other tools to assess use in this population and any clustering of outcome scores. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the PROMIS Mobility and other established PROMs; NAHS (r(s) = 0.79; p < 0.001). There was notable clustering in PROMIS at the upper end of the distribution score (42.5%), with less seen in the NAHS (20.3%). However, the clustering was broadly similar between PROMIS Mobility and the comparable domains of the NAHS; function (53.6%), and activity (35.0%). CONCLUSION: PROMIS Mobility strongly correlated with other tools demonstrating convergent construct validity. There was clustering of physical function scores at the upper end of the distributions, which may reflect truncation of the data caused by participants having excellent outcomes. There were elements of disease not captured within PROMIS Mobility alone, and difficulties in differentiating those with the highest levels of function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative mood is an important risk factor for poor clinical outcomes among individuals with musculoskeletal pain. Screening for negative mood can aid in identifying those who may need additional psychological interventions. Limitations of current negative mood screening tools include (1) high response burden, (2) a focus on single dimensions of negative mood, (3) poor precision for identifying individuals with low or high negative mood levels, and/or (4) design not specific for use in populations with orthopaedic conditions and musculoskeletal pain. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Can item response theory methods be used to construct screening tools for negative mood (such as depression, anxiety, and anger) in patients undergoing physical therapy for orthopaedic conditions? (2) Do these tools demonstrate reliability and construct validity when used in a clinical setting? METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving outpatients having physical therapy in tertiary-care settings. A total of 431 outpatients with neck (n = 93), shoulder (n = 108), low back (n = 119), or knee (n = 111) conditions were enrolled between December 2014 and December 2015, with 24% (103 of 431) seeking care after orthopaedic surgery. Participants completed three validated psychological questionnaires measuring negative mood, resulting in 39 candidate items for item response theory analysis. Factor analysis was used to identify the dimensions (factors) assessed by the candidate items and select items that loaded on the main factor of interest (negative mood), establishing a unidimensional item set. Unidimensionality of an item set suggests they are assessing one main factor or trait, allowing unbiased score estimates. The identified items were assessed for their fit to the graded item response theory model. This model allows for items to vary by the level of difficulty they represent and by their ability to discriminate between patients at different levels of the trait being assessed, in this case, negative mood. Finally, a hierarchical bifactor model where multiple subfactors are allowed to load on an overall factor was used to confirm that the items identified as representing a unidimensional item set explained the large majority of variance of the overall factor, providing additional support for essential unidimensionality. Using the final item bank, we constructed a computer adaptive test administration mode, and reduced item sets were selected to create short forms including items with the highest information (reliability) at targeted score levels of the trait being measured, while also considering clinical content. RESULTS: We identified a 12-item bank for assessment of negative mood; eight-item and four-item short-form versions were developed to reduce administrative burden. Computer adaptive test administration used a mean +/- SD of 8 +/- 1 items. The item bank's reliability (0 = no reliability; 1 = perfect reliability) was 0.89 for the computer adaptive test administration, 0.86 for the eight-item short form, and 0.71 for the four-item short form. Reliability values equal to or greater than 0.7 are considered acceptable for group level measures. Construct validity sufficient for clinical practice was supported by more severe negative mood scores among individuals with a previous episode of pain in the involved anatomical region, pain and activity limitations during the past 3 months, a work-related injury, education less than a college degree, and income less than or equal to USD 50,000. CONCLUSION: These newly derived tools include short-form and computer adaptive test options for reliable and valid negative mood assessment in outpatient orthopaedic populations. Future research should determine the responsiveness of these measures to change and establish score thresholds for clinical decision-making. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Orthopaedic providers can use these tools to inform prognosis, establish clinical benchmarks, and identify patients who may benefit from psychological and/or behavioral treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and functional decline, often leading to deterioration and dependency. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) provides opportunity to improve clinical and functional recovery, yet participation in CR decreases with age. Modified Application of CR in Older Adults (MACRO) is a National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded pragmatic trial that responds to this gap by aiming to increase enrollment of older adults into CR and improving functional outcomes. This article describes the methodology and novel features of the MACRO trial. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trial of a coaching intervention (MACRO-I) vs. usual care for older adults (age >/= 70 years) eligible for CR after an incident cardiac hospitalization. MACRO-I incorporates innovations including holistic risk assessments, flexible CR format (i.e., helping patients to select a CR design that aligns with their personal risks and preferences), motivational prompts, nutritional emphasis, facilitated deprescription, enhanced education, and home visits. Key modifications were necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including switching from a performance-based primary endpoint (Short Physical Performance Battery) to a patient-reported measure (Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Computerized Adaptive Testing). Changes prompted by COVID-19 maintain the original intent of the trial and provide key methodologic advantages. CONCLUSIONS: MACRO is exploring a novel individualized coaching intervention to better enable older patients to participate in CR. Due to COVID-19 many aspects of the MACRO protocol required modification, but the primary objective of the trial is maintained and the updated protocol will more effectively achieve the original goals of the study.

AB  - Itch compromises QOL, but most itch assessments focus only on itch intensity. We aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatric measure for itch symptoms and itch impact, defined as the effect specifically of itch on physical, mental, and social health, all of which can affect life quality. After literature review, concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with parents and children with itch, and repeated content-expert review, an item pool was generated and refined. The pool was calibrated with data from 499 children with pruritus using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, item response theory, and item fit analysis. The resultant 45-item bank, PROMIS Itch Questionnaire-Child (PIQ-C), showed good convergent and discriminant validity in 181 children aged 8â€’17 years, discriminating children with different levels of severity, and was responsive to change. Strong correlations (rho >/= 0.60) were observed with pain and sleep measures, and moderate correlations were observed with other pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Itch Questionnaire-Child comprehensively measures itch intensity and burden, providing an itch-specific alternative for assessing life quality. The independent calibration of each item/question allows for flexibility in generating short forms or computerized adaptive testing for efficient use in research and office practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social deprivation negatively affects a myriad of physical and behavioral health outcomes. Several measures of social deprivation exist, but it is unclear which measure is best suited to describe patients with orthopaedic conditions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which measure of social deprivation, defined as "limited access to society's resources due to poverty, discrimination, or other disadvantage," is most strongly and consistently correlated with patient-reported physical and behavioral health in patients with orthopaedic conditions? (2) Compared with the use of a single measure alone, how much more variability in patient-reported health does the simultaneous use of multiple social deprivation measures capture? METHODS: Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 79,818 new patient evaluations occurred within the orthopaedic department of a single, large, urban, tertiary-care academic center. Over that period, standardized collection of patient-reported health measures (as described by the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]) was implemented in a staged fashion throughout the department. We excluded the 25% (19,926) of patient encounters that did not have associated PROMIS measures reported, which left 75% (59,892) of patient encounters available for analysis in this cross-sectional study of existing medical records. Five markers of social deprivation were collected for each patient: national and state Area Deprivation Index, Medically Underserved Area Status, Rural-Urban Commuting Area code, and insurance classification (private, Medicare, Medicaid, or other). Patient-reported physical and behavioral health was measured via PROMIS computer adaptive test domains, which patients completed as part of standard care before being evaluated by a provider. Adults completed the PROMIS Physical Function version 1.2 or version 2.0, Pain Interference version 1.1, Anxiety version 1.0, and Depression version 1.0. Children ages 5 to 17 years completed the PROMIS Pediatric Mobility version 1.0 or version 2.0, Pain Interference version 1.0 or version 2.0, Upper Extremity version 1.0, and Peer Relationships version 1.0. Age-adjusted partial Pearson correlation coefficients were determined for each social deprivation measure and PROMIS domain. Coefficients of at least 0.1 were considered clinically meaningful for this purpose. Additionally, to determine the percentage of PROMIS score variability that could be attributed to each social deprivation measure, an age-adjusted hierarchical regression analysis was performed for each PROMIS domain, in which social deprivation measures were sequentially added as independent variables. The model coefficients of determination (r2) were compared as social deprivation measures were incrementally added. Improvement of the r2 by at least 10% was considered clinically meaningful. RESULTS: Insurance classification was the social deprivation measure with the largest (absolute value) age-adjusted correlation coefficient for all adult and pediatric PROMIS physical and behavioral health domains (adults: correlation coefficient 0.40 to 0.43 [95% CI 0.39 to 0.44]; pediatrics: correlation coefficient 0.10 to 0.19 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.21]), followed by national Area Deprivation Index (adults: correlation coefficient 0.18 to 0.22 [95% CI 0.17 to 0.23]; pediatrics: correlation coefficient 0.08 to 0.15 [95% CI 0.06 to 0.17]), followed closely by state Area Deprivation Index. The Medically Underserved Area Status and Rural-Urban Commuting Area code each had correlation coefficients of 0.1 or larger for some PROMIS domains but neither had consistently stronger correlation coefficients than the other. Except for the PROMIS Pediatric Upper Extremity domain, consideration of insurance classification and the national Area Deprivation Index together explained more of the variation in age-adjusted PROMIS scores than the use of insurance classification alone (adults: r2 improvement 32% to 189% [95% CI 0.02 to 0.04]; pediatrics: r2 improvement 56% to 110% [95% CI 0.01 to 0.02]). The addition of the Medically Underserved Area Status, Rural-Urban Commuting Area code, and/or state Area Deprivation Index did not further improve the r2 for any of the PROMIS domains. CONCLUSION: To capture the most variability due to social deprivation in orthopaedic patients' self-reported physical and behavioral health, insurance classification (categorized as private, Medicare, Medicaid, or other) and national Area Deprivation Index should be included in statistical analyses. If only one measure of social deprivation is preferred, insurance classification or national Area Deprivation Index are reasonable options. Insurance classification may be more readily available, but the national Area Deprivation Index stratifies patients across a wider distribution of values. When conducting clinical outcomes research with social deprivation as a relevant covariate, we encourage researchers to consider accounting for insurance classification and/or national Area Deprivation Index, both of which are freely available and can be obtained from data that are typically collected during routine clinical care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are comorbidities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and it is now recommended to screen IBD patients for these conditions. We screened patients using a novel computerized adaptive testing technology and compared the screening results to measures of disease activity. METHODS: Consecutive patients at our tertiary IBD clinic were asked to complete the validated CAT-MH survey (Adaptive Testing Technologies, Chicago, IL); we then reviewed disease and patient characteristics. Clinical remission status was determined based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopy and imaging results. Statistical methods included Fisher's exact test and Pearson Chi-square tests to assess association. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: We included 134 patients, of which 34 (25.3%) screened positive for depression and 18 (13.4%) screened positive for anxiety. We identified 19 (55.9 %) and 10 (55.5%) patients who were previously undiagnosed for depression and anxiety, respectively. Patients in clinical remission were less likely to screen positive for depression (OR 0.19; 95%CI 0.07-0.50) and for anxiety (OR 0.30; 95%CI 0.10-0.91). Compared to patients with negative CRP values, patients with positive CRP were more likely to also screen positive for depression (p=0.025) and anxiety (p=0.15). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of a novel testing technology for screening patients with IBD for depression and anxiety. We found a large number of patients with previously undiagnosed anxiety or depression and a significant positive association between clinically active IBD and these mental health conditions. This work supports and informs recommendations for mental health screening in the IBD population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measures of unhelpful thoughts and distress correlate with the intensity of pain and the magnitude of incapability among people seeking musculoskeletal specialty care. In this evolving knowledge area, we want to be sure we have not neglected other important mental health factors. This study addressed how measures of confidence in problem solving as well as past and current ability to achieve goals account for variation in symptoms and capability independent of unhelpful thoughts and distress. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are measures of confidence in problem solving ability and past and current ability to achieve goals regarding future outcomes associated with variation in capability, independent of measures of symptoms of depression and anxiety (distress) and measures of unhelpful thoughts (worst-case thinking, negative pain thoughts)? (2) Are these measures independently associated with variation in pain intensity? (3) Are these measures associated with measures of symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, and unhelpful thoughts? METHODS: Over a 7-month period during the pandemic, we enrolled sporadically from the offices of four surgeons treating patients who sought care for various upper and lower extremity conditions. We invited approximately 200 adult new and returning patients to participate (the number of invitations was not formally tracked) and 187 accepted. Thirty-one were excluded due to markedly incomplete entries (related to a problematic attempt to use the patient's cell phone to complete questionnaires as a pandemic work around), leaving 156 for analysis. Patients completed an 11-point ordinal rating of pain intensity, two measures of unhelpful thoughts (the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Negative Pain Thoughts Questionnaire), the Adult Hope Scale to measure past and current ability to achieve goals, the Personal Optimism and Self-Efficacy Optimism Scale to measure confidence in problem solving ability, the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive test to measure symptoms of anxiety, the PROMIS computer adaptive test to measure symptoms of depression, and the PROMIS physical function computer adaptive test to assess the magnitude of capability. All questionnaires were validated in previous studies. We used bivariate analyses to identify factors associated with magnitude of capability, pain intensity, confidence in problem solving ability, and past and current ability to achieve goals. All factors with a p value of less than 0.1 were included in multivariable analyses to seek associations between these measures accounting for confounders. We reported partial eta2 as a measure of effect size for all multivariable regression models. The following rules of thumb are used to interpret values for partial eta2: a value of 0.01 = small, 0.06 = medium, and values of 0.14 and higher show large effect size. RESULTS: Greater capability was modestly associated with fewer negative pain thoughts (beta = -0.63 [95% CI -1.0 to -0.22]; standard error = 0.20; partial eta2 = 0.06; p = 0.003) and no self-reported comorbidities (beta = 2.6 [95% CI 0.02 to 5.3]; standard error = 1.3; partial eta2 = 0.03; p = 0.048) after controlling for education, symptoms of depression and anxiety, worst-case thinking, as well as past and current ability to achieve goals. In a similar multivariable model, greater pain intensity was modestly associated with greater worst-case thinking (beta = 0.33 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.45]; standard error = 0.06; partial eta2 = 0.16; p < 0.001) and established patients (beta = -1.1 [95% CI -1.8 to -0.31]; standard error = 0.38; partial eta2 = 0.05; p = 0.006). In another similar multivariable model, having more confidence in problem solving ability had a limited association with higher ratings of past and current ability to achieve goals (beta = 0.15 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.21]; standard error = 0.03; partial eta2 = 0.13; p < 0.001). In a final multivariable model, lower past and current ability to achieve goals was independently associated with having greater symptoms of depression (beta = -0.45 [95% CI -0.67 to -0.23]; standard error = 0.11; partial eta2 = 0.1; p < 0.001) and more negative pain thoughts (beta = -0.49 [95% CI -0.89 to -0.09]; standard error = 0.20; partial eta2 = 0.04; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The observation that unhelpful thoughts about symptoms are more strongly associated with symptom intensity than past and current ability to achieve goals and confidence in problem solving ability add to the evidence that attentiveness to unhelpful thinking is an important aspect of musculoskeletal health. Musculoskeletal specialists can prioritize communication strategies such as relationship building and motivational interviewing that develop trust and facilitate reorientation of common unhelpful thoughts. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are differences in roles between the more-affected and less-affected upper limb of children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, there is a lack of studies of the relationship between the more-affected limb function and activities of daily living (ADL) in children with CP. Thus, the aim of this prospective cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between more-affected upper limb function and ADL in children with CP. METHODS: Children with spastic CP (unilateral CP n = 28, bilateral CP n = 31; 34 males, 25 females; mean age +/- SD, 6.8 +/- 3.1y [range, 3-14y]) participated in this study. Function of the more-affected upper limb was measured using the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper limb Function, version 2 (MA2) and the Upper Limb Physician's Rating Scale (ULPRS). Performance of daily living activities was measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT). RESULTS: The range, accuracy and fluency dimension of MA2 and ULPRS total scores were moderately correlated with the daily activity domain (r = 0.47, 0.47, 0.56 for MA2 and r = 0.50 for ULPRS, respectively; P < 0.001) rather than the mobility, social/cognitive, and responsibility domains of the PEDI-CAT. ULPRS scores for elbow extension, supination in extension, supination in flexion, and two-handed function were moderately correlated with the PEDI-CAT daily activity domain (r = 0.44, 0.43, 0.41, and 0.49, respectively; P < 0.01). Finger opening and thumb-in-palm deformity of the ULPRS did not correlate with any PEDI-CAT domain. CONCLUSIONS: The MA2 range, accuracy, and fluency domains (rather than dexterity) had the strongest correlations with the PEDI-CAT daily activity domain. Elbow extension, forearm supination, and two-handed function (rather than wrist and finger movements) of the ULPRS had the strongest correlations with the PEDI-CAT daily activity domain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There remains a paucity of information analyzing which factors most influence preoperative expectations for patients undergoing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). The purposes of our study were to characterize preoperative patient expectations for those scheduled to undergo RTSA and to determine the impact of demographic factors, shoulder function, and shoulder pain on these preoperative expectations. METHODS: Patients were prospectively recruited into the study if they were scheduled to undergo an elective unilateral primary RTSA for a diagnosis of glenohumeral arthritis. Preoperative patient expectations were evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery's Shoulder Surgery Expectation Survey. Patients also completed the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function-Upper Extremity computer adaptive test (version 2.0), the PROMIS Pain Interference (PI) computer adaptive test (version 1.1), the PROMIS Depression computer adaptive test (version 1.0), visual analog scores, and an itemized satisfaction questionnaire, which paralleled the Hospital for Special Surgery's Shoulder Surgery Expectation Survey. Demographic data and preoperative shoulder range of motion (ROM) were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients scheduled to undergo RTSA were included in the study. Relief of daytime pain (n = 91, 85%), improvement in self-care (n = 86, 80%), and improvement in shoulder ROM (n = 85, 79%) were most commonly cited as "very important" expectations. In the item-specific analysis, lower PROMIS Upper Extremity scores were correlated with greater expectations for the ability to reach sideways (P = .015) and the ability to perform daily activities (P = .018). Patients with lower shoulder ROM had greater expectations for improved shoulder ROM (internal rotation with arm at 90 degrees , P = .004) and an improved ability to perform daily activities (forward elevation, P = .038; abduction, P = .009). In the cumulative analysis, a greater number of very important expectations was associated with African American race (P = .013), higher PROMIS PI score (r = 0.351, P = .004), and lower overall preoperative satisfaction (r = 0.334, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients scheduled to undergo RTSA have the greatest expectations for relief of daytime pain, improvement in self-care, and improvement in shoulder ROM. Patients with limited preoperative ROM have greater expectations for improvement in self-care and the ability to perform daily activities in addition to expectations for improvement in shoulder ROM. Greater overall expectations for surgery were not associated with preoperative physical function but were instead associated with lower preoperative satisfaction and higher PROMIS PI scores.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multidimensional computerized adaptive test, the Functional Assessment in Acute Care Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Test (FAMCAT), could be administered to hospitalized patients via a tablet computer rather than being orally administered by an interviewer. DESIGN: A randomized comparison of the responses of hospitalized patients to interviewer vs tablet delivery of the FAMCAT and its assessment of applied cognition, daily activity, and basic mobility. SETTING: Two quaternary teaching hospitals in the Upper Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 300 patients (127 men, 165 women), average age 61.2 (range, 18-97) hospitalized on medical services or rehospitalized on surgical services were randomly assigned to either a tablet (150) or an interview (150) group. INTERVENTION: Electronic tablet vs interview. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Item response theory point estimates of the FAMCAT latent scales, their psychometric standard errors, number of items administered per domain, the determinant (an indicator of overall precision of the latent trait vector), as well as the time that patients required to complete their FAMCAT sessions. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients, 292 completed their assessments. The assessments of 4 individuals in each group was interrupted by clinical care and were not included in the analyses. A significant (P=.009) mode effect (ie, interview vs tablet) was identified when all outcome variables were considered simultaneously. However, the only outcome that was affected by the administration mode was test duration: tablet administration reduced the roughly 6-minute test time required by both approaches by only 20 seconds, which, though statistically significant, was clinically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of a FAMCAT assessment, at least for this cohort of hospitalized patients, are independent of administration via tablet computer or interview.

AB  - Nondestructive magnetic measurement methods can be successfully applied to determine the embrittlement of nuclear pressure vessel steel caused by neutron irradiation. It was found in previous works that reasonable correlation could be obtained between the nondestructively measured magnetic parameters and destructively determined ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. However, a large scatter of the measurement points was detected even in the cases of the non-irradiated reference samples. The reason for their scattering was attributed to the local inhomogeneity of material. This conclusion is verified in the present work by applying three different magnetic methods on two sets of Charpy samples made of two different reactor steel materials. It was found that by an optimal magnetic pre-selection of samples, a good, linear correlation can be found between magnetic parameters as well as the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature with low scattering of points. This result shows that neutron irradiation embrittlement depends very much on the local material properties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with traditional screening questionnaires, computerised adaptive tests for severity of depression (CAT-DI) and computerised adaptive diagnostic modules for depression (CAD-MDD) show improved precision in screening for major depressive disorder. CAT measures have been tailored to perinatal women but have not been studied in low-income women of colour despite high rates of perinatal depression (PND). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the concordance between CAT and traditional measures of depression in a sample of primarily low-income black and Latina women. METHODS: In total, 373 women (49% black; 29% Latina) completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), CAD-MDD and CAT-DI at 845 visits across pregnancy and postpartum. We examined the concordance between continuous CAT-DI and PHQ-9 scores and between binary measures of PND diagnosis on CAD-MDD and the PHQ-9 (cut-off score >10). We examined cases with a positive PND diagnosis on the CAD-MDD but not on the PHQ-9 ('missed' cases) to determine whether clinic notes were consistent with CAD-MDD results. FINDINGS: CAT-DI and PHQ-9 scores were significantly associated (concordance correlation coefficient=0.67; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.74). CAD-MDD detected 5% more case of PND compared with PHQ-9 (p<0.001). The average per-visit rate of PND was 14.4% (14.5% in blacks, 14.9% in Latinas) on the CAD-MDD, and 9.5% (9.8% in blacks, 8.8% in Latinas) on the PHQ-9. Clinical notes were available on 60% of 'missed' cases and validated CAD-MDD PND diagnosis in 89% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: CAD-MDD detected 5% more cases of PND in women of colour compared with traditional tests, and the majority of these cases were verified by clinician notes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of CAT in routine clinic care may address health disparities in PND screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhythms And You (RAY) is an online intervention for bipolar disorders (BD) based on Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy. We examined RAY's feasibility and acceptability for individuals with BD recruited from primary care. Because online interventions may be more effective when paired with human support, we evaluated RAY with and without weekly brief ( approximately 5 min) calls from clinical helpers (CH). METHODS: Participants (n = 47) meeting criteria for BD I, II or other specified BD, presenting for primary care, were randomly assigned to RAY, RAY-CH, or Adjunctive Reading Material (ARM) control. RAY consisted of 12 weekly online modules. ARM consisted of 12 weekly emails. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: RAY showed high completion rates and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire scores (36/47, 77% and 25.1 +/- 5.5, respectively; no group differences). Effect sizes for RAY- CH ranged from small [Internal State Scale-Activation Subscale (ISS-ACT); d = 0.3] to large [SF-12 Mental Health Composite Score (SF-12 MHC); d = 1.3]. ARM also showed moderate effects (ISS-ACT d = 0.7; Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, d = 0.8). SF-12 MHC scores showed a time*group interaction (F = 2.38, df = 6,32, p = 0.05) favoring RAY-CH. Number of logins trended toward significant association with improved social rhythm regularity (F = 4.09, df = 1, 17, p = 0.06). LIMITATIONS: Sample size is small, limiting conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Remote delivery of RAY for individuals with BD is feasible and acceptable. More time spent engaged in RAY was associated with greater improvement in social rhythm regularity. Preliminary evidence suggests adding brief human support to RAY may yield better outcomes.

TI  - Are Patient Linguistic Tones Associated with Mental Health and Perceived Clinician Empathy?
JO  - The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume
VL  - NA
PY  - 2021
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal specialists have the expertise to distinguish between (1) symptoms that correspond well with observed pathophysiology and (2) disproportionate or incongruent symptoms that may suggest mental and social health opportunities. There is evidence that patient verbal and nonverbal communication can help with this discernment. This study carried this line of research one step further by addressing whether patient linguistic tones, as assessed with use of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), are associated with symptoms of depression and health anxiety. We also sought associations between both patient and clinician linguistic tones and patient-perceived clinician empathy. METHODS: A secondary analysis of transcripts of video and audio recordings of 109 adult patients seeking musculoskeletal specialty care was performed. Patients also completed questionnaires quantifying symptoms of depression (PROMIS [Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System] Depression computerized adaptive test), self-efficacy when in pain (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, 2-question version), symptoms of health anxiety (5-item Short Health Anxiety Inventory [SHAI-5]), and perceived clinician empathy (Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy [JSPPPE]). LIWC was used to detect the relative strength of various emotional tones, cognitive processes, and core drives and needs. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses sought factors associated with symptoms of depression, symptoms of health anxiety, and patient perception of clinician empathy. RESULTS: With greater levels of depression, patients express less emotion overall as detected with use of computational linguistic analysis. After accounting for demographic variables, there were no specific linguistic tones associated with health anxiety and symptoms of depression. Stronger negative linguistic tones were associated with lower pain self-efficacy. Greater perceived clinician empathy was associated with more words spoken by the clinician and the patient, greater patient use of adjectives, lower prevalence of patient tones of "analytic," lower clinician tones of "social," and greater tones of "cause." CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal specialists cannot depend on people experiencing symptoms of psychological distress to verbally express their feelings. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Specialists may be more likely to identify important symptoms of psychological distress if they anticipate lower emotional expressiveness and are attentive to specific words, concepts, and mannerisms known to be associated with distress.

CY  - NA
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures can be administered via computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or fixed short forms (FSFs), but the empirical benefits of CAT versus FSFs are unknown in juvenile myositis (JM). The present study was undertaken to assess whether PROMIS CAT is feasible, precise, correlated with FSFs, and less prone to respondent burden and floor/ceiling effects than FSFs in JM. METHODS: Patients 8-17 years of age (self-report and parent proxy) and parents of patients 5-7 years of age (only parent proxy) completed PROMIS fatigue, pain interference, upper extremity function, mobility, anxiety, and depressive symptoms measures. Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were calculated between PROMIS CAT and FSFs. McNemar's test assessed floor/ceiling effects between CAT and FSFs. Precision and respondent burden were examined across the T score range. RESULTS: Data from 67 patient-parent dyads were analyzed. CAT and FSF mean scores did not significantly differ except in parent proxy anxiety and fatigue (effect size 0.23 and 0.19, respectively). CAT had less pronounced floor/ceiling effects at the less symptomatic extreme in all domains except self-report anxiety. Increased item burden and higher SEs were seen in less symptomatic scorers for CAT. Modified stopping rules limiting CAT item administration did not decrease precision. CONCLUSION: PROMIS CAT appears to be feasible and correlated with FSFs. CAT had less pronounced floor/ceiling effects, allowing detection of individual differences in less symptomatic patients. Modified stopping rules for CAT may decrease respondent burden. CAT can be considered for long-term follow-up of JM patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are important for understanding recovery after burn injury, benchmarking service delivery and measuring the impact of interventions. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 domains have been validated for use among diverse populations though not among burn survivors. The purpose of this study was to examine validity and reliability of PROMIS-29 scores in this population. METHODS: The PROMIS-29 scores of physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles, and pain interference were evaluated for validity and reliability in adult burn survivors. Unidimensionality, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, and reliability were examined. Differential item functioning was used to examine bias with respect to demographic and injury characteristics. Correlations with measures of related constructs (Community Integration Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian, and Veteran's Rand-12) and known-group differences were examined. RESULTS: Eight hundred and seventy-six burn survivors with moderate to severe injury from 6 months to 20 years postburn provided responses on PROMIS-29 domains. Participants' ages ranged from 18 years to 93 years at time of assessment; mean years since injury was 3.4. All PROMIS domain scores showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87-0.97). There was a large ceiling effect on ability to participate in social roles (39.7%) and physical function (43.3%). One-factor confirmatory factor analyses supported unidimensionality (all comparative fit indices >0.95). We found no statistically significant bias (differential item functioning). Reliability was high (>0.9) across trait levels for all domains except sleep, which reached moderate reliability (>0.85). All known-group differences by demographic and clinical characteristics were in the hypothesized direction and magnitude except burn size categories. CONCLUSION: The results provide strong evidence for reliability and validity of PROMIS-29 domain scores among adult burn survivors. Reliability of the extreme scores could be increased and the ceiling effects reduced by administering PROMIS-43, which includes six items per domain, or by administering by computerized adaptive testing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Test or Criteria, level III.

AB  - AIMS: Patient-reported outcome measures have become an important part of routine care. The aim of this study was to determine if Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures can be used to create patient subgroups for individuals seeking orthopaedic care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients from Duke University Department of Orthopaedic Surgery clinics (14 ambulatory and four hospital-based). There were two separate cohorts recruited by convenience sampling (i.e. patients were included in the analysis only if they completed PROMIS measures during a new patient visit). Cohort #1 (n = 12,141; December 2017 to December 2018,) included PROMIS short forms for eight domains (Physical Function, Pain Interference, Pain Intensity, Depression, Anxiety, Sleep Quality, Participation in Social Roles, and Fatigue) and Cohort #2 (n = 4,638; January 2019 to August 2019) included PROMIS Computer Adaptive Testing instruments for four domains (Physical Function, Pain Interference, Depression, and Sleep Quality). Cluster analysis (K-means method) empirically derived subgroups and subgroup differences in clinical and sociodemographic factors were identified with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Cluster analysis yielded four subgroups with similar clinical characteristics in Cohort #1 and #2. The subgroups were: 1) Normal Function: within normal limits in Physical Function, Pain Interference, Depression, and Sleep Quality; 2) Mild Impairment: mild deficits in Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Sleep Quality but with Depression within normal limits; 3) Impaired Function, Not Distressed: moderate deficits in Physical Function and Pain Interference, but within normal limits for Depression and Sleep Quality; and 4) Impaired Function, Distressed: moderate (Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Sleep Quality) and mild (Depression) deficits. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest orthopaedic patient subgroups differing in physical function, pain, and psychosocial distress can be created from as few as four different PROMIS measures. Longitudinal research is necessary to determine whether these subgroups have prognostic validity. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(7):493-502.

CY  - NA
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Veterans from recent and past conflicts have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5. RESULTS: Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r = 0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r = 0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic screening and severity measurement are possible.

AB  - Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are utilized in clinical registries and trials, necessitating development of benchmarks to enhance interpretability. This study aimed to 1) examine if PROMIS measures administered via computer adaptive testing (CAT) were responsive to change, and 2) highlight one method of assessing clinically significant change for youth seen in a tertiary pain clinic. Clinically significant change was achieved if patients had significantly reliable pre-to-post-changes greater than Reliable Change Index (RCI) value and reported decreased symptoms by at least one severity level (e.g., moderate to mild). Participants were 328 youth (8-17 years old) seen in a tertiary pediatric pain management clinic. Small to moderate effect sizes were noted across PROMIS measures (except Peer Relations). Reliable magnitudes of change were estimated for this sample as approximately 6 point reduction for Pain Interference and Mobility, 9 for Fatigue, and 11 for Anxiety and Depression. Depending on the measure, 10 to 24% were categorized as improved, 3 to 6% as deteriorated, and 68 to 81% were either not clinically elevated at baseline or remained unchanged at 3 months. Overall, PROMIS CAT measures demonstrated responsiveness to change over time. Estimation of clinically significant change offers preliminary yet rigorous benchmarks for evaluating treatment response and sets the stage for understanding treatment effects. PERSPECTIVE: This study assesses responsiveness of CAT administered PROMIS measures and highlights one methodological approach of presenting clinical significance for assessing treatment outcomes in pediatric chronic pain. These benchmarks will allow clinicians and researchers to evaluate treatment response utilizing PROs while allowing for a deeper understanding of treatment effects.

AB  - Pediatric burn injuries can alter the trajectory of the survivor's entire life. Patient-centered outcome measures are helpful to assess unique physical and psychosocial needs and long-term recovery. This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework to measure pediatric burn outcomes in survivors aged 5 to 12 years as a part of the School-Aged Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation Computer Adaptive Test (SA-LIBRE5-12 CAT) development. This study conducted a systematic literature review guided by the WHO International Classification of Functioning-Child and Youth and domains in the American Burn Association/Shriners Hospitals for Children Burn Outcomes Questionnaire5-18. Interviews with eight parents and seven clinicians were conducted to identify important domains in child recovery. One clinician focus group with four clinicians was completed to identify gaps in the preliminary framework, and semiweekly expert consensus meetings were conducted with three experts to solidify the framework. Qualitative data were analyzed by grounded theory methodology. Three major thematic outcome domains emerged: 1) Physical Functioning: fine motor and upper extremity, gross motor and lower extremity, pain, skin symptoms, sleep and fatigue, and physical resilience; 2) Psychological Functioning: cognitive, behavioral, emotional, resilience, and body image; and 3) Family and Social Functioning: family relationships, and parental satisfaction, school, peer relations, and community participation. The framework will be used to develop item banks for a CAT-based assessment of school-aged children's health and developmental outcomes, which will be designed for clinical and research use to optimize interventions, personalize care, and improve long-term health outcomes for burned children.

AB  - Geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures have been used extensively in recent decades due to their significant advantages over more conventional earth retaining structures, including the cost-effectiveness, reduced construction time, and possibility of using locally-available lower quality soils and/or waste materials, such as recycled construction and demolition (C&D) wastes. The time-dependent shear behaviour at the interfaces between the geosynthetic and the backfill is an important factor affecting the overall long-term performance of such structures, and thereby should be properly understood. In this study, an innovative multistage direct shear test procedure is introduced to characterise the time-dependent response of the interface between a high-strength geotextile and a recycled C&D material. After a prescribed shear displacement is reached, the shear box is kept stationary for a specific period of time, after which the test proceeds again, at a constant displacement rate, until the peak and large-displacement shear strengths are mobilised. The shear stress-shear displacement curves from the proposed multistage tests exhibited a progressive decrease in shear stress with time (stress relaxation) during the period in which the shear box was restrained from any movement, which was more pronounced under lower normal stress values. Regardless of the prior interface shear displacement and duration of the stress relaxation stage, the peak and residual shear strength parameters of the C&D material-geotextile interface remained similar to those obtained from the conventional (benchmark) tests carried out under constant displacement rate.

AB  - Computer-adaptive tests use respondents' answers to previous questions to select the subsequent questions. They are gaining popularity for their increased measurement precision and decreased administration time compared to static questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to estimate the test-retest reliability and construct validity of the computer-adaptive test version of a participation measure, the Late Life Disability Instrument (LLDI-CAT) for people with COPD and to compare scores and administration time with those of the static LLDI. Among 76 older adults with COPD, scores on the LLDI-CAT were compared to scores on measures of related constructs, between groups based on symptom severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype, and to scores on the static LLDI. A subsample of 28 people completed the LLDI-CAT a second time within one week of the initial administration for test-retest reliability. The LLDI-CAT had very good test-retest reliability (ICC(2,1) 0.88; SEM 2.74 points), fair correlations with physical function (r = 0.37-0.50), anxiety (r=-0.42), and depression (r=-0.50), fair to moderately-strong correlations with quality of life (r = 0.48-0.63), and strong correlation with the static LLDI limitation domain (r = 0.80). The LLDI-CAT scores differed between people with different symptom severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype (p </= 0.004). The mean administration time for the LLDI-CAT was 3.3 (1.5) minutes, less than that of the static LLDI at 6.3 (2.8) minutes (p < 0.001). The LLDI-CAT demonstrates evidence of test-retest reliability and construct validity, and correlates well with the limitation domain of the static LLDI for people with COPD. The LLDI-CAT can be used to assess participation for this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee have a notable variation that does not correspond directly with pathophysiology. The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of location of the arthritis on pain intensity and magnitude of limitations accounting for personal and psychological factors. METHODS: One hundred and fifty four patients with osteoarthritis of the hip (41 patients) or the knee (113 patients) were enrolled in this prospective cross sectional cohort study. Patients answered questionnaires which included demographics, site of arthritis (hip or knee), laterality (unilateral or bilateral), pain intensity, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS PF CAT), and psychologic questionnaires including the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-4), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Dep CAT). Kellgren-Lawrence classification was classified by the treating surgeon. Associations of these factors with pain and function were assessed using bivariate and multivariable regression models. RESULTS: In a multivariable model accounting for potential confounding, magnitude of limitations was independently associated with years of education, work status, time spent exercising, catastrophic thinking (PCS-4), and symptoms of depression. They accounted for 50% of variability in physical function, with the major contributor being catastrophic thinking. The model for pain intensity included time spent exercising and fear of painful movement (TSK-4). Anatomic site and radiographic severity of arthritis were not associated with either physical function or pain in our patient sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that limitations and pain from osteoarthritis of the hip and knee are more closely related to personal and psychological factors, less effective cognitive coping strategies such as catastrophic thinking and kinesiophobia in particular, than to pathological and anatomical factors such as location and severity of arthritis. Care that incorporates incremental correction of common misconceptions that accompany the nociception from osteoarthritis have the potential to improve function and comfort in people with osteoarthritis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research consistently documents no correlation between the duration of a musculoskeletal specialty care visit and patient experience (perceived empathy of the specialist and satisfaction with care). Based on a combination of clinical experience and other lines of research, we speculate that longer visits are often related to discordance between specialist and patient interpretation of symptoms and weighting of available test and treatment options. If this is true, then the specific duration of time discussing the specialist's interpretations and options with the patient (expertise transfer) might correlate with satisfaction with care and perceived empathy of the clinician even if the total visit time does not. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What demographic or mental health factors are associated with the duration of expertise transfer? (2) What factors, including the duration of expertise transfer, are associated with the patient's satisfaction with the visit and perceived clinician empathy? METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 128 new and returning English-speaking adult outpatients seeking care from one of three orthopaedic specialists in two urban practices between September and November 2019 were enrolled and agreed to audio recording of the visit. A total of 92% (118) of patients completed the questionnaire and had a usable recording. Participants completed a sociodemographic survey, the Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System Depression computer adaptive test (PROMIS Depression CAT; a measure of symptoms of depression), the Short Health Anxiety Index (SHAI-5; a measure of symptoms of hypochondriasis, a form of symptoms misinterpretation), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4; a measure of misinterpretation of symptoms), an ordinal measure of patient satisfaction (dichotomized into satisfied or not because of strong ceiling effects), and the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perception of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE; a measure of perceived clinician empathy). The duration of expertise transfer and the total duration of the visit were measured by two raters with acceptable reliability using software that facilitates segmentation of the visit audio recording. To determine factors associated with the duration of expertise transfer, satisfaction, and empathy, we planned a multivariable analysis controlling for potential confounding variables identified in exploratory bivariable analysis. However, there were insufficient associations to merit multivariable analysis. RESULTS: A longer duration of expertise transfer had a modest correlation with catastrophic thinking (r = 0.24; p = 0.01). Complete satisfaction with the visit was associated with less health anxiety (6 [interquartile range 5 to 7] for complete satisfaction versus 7 [5 to 7] for less than complete satisfaction; p = 0.02) and catastrophic thinking (4 [1 to 7] versus 5 [3 to 11]; p = 0.02), but not with the duration of expertise transfer. Greater perceived clinician empathy had a slight correlation with less health anxiety (r = -0.19; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with greater misinterpretation of symptoms experience a slightly less satisfying visit and less empathetic relationship with a musculoskeletal specialist despite a longer duration of expertise transfer. This supports the concept that directive strategies (such as teaching healthy interpretation of symptoms) may be less effective then guiding strategies (such as nurturing openness to alternative, healthier interpretation of symptoms using motivational interviewing tactics, often over more than one visit or point of contact). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

AB  - Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), tools to assess patient self-report of health status, are now increasingly used in research, care and policymaking. While there are two well-developed disease-specific PROMs for interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), many unmet and urgent needs remain. In December 2019, 64 international ILD experts convened in Erice, Italy to deliberate on many topics, including PROMs in ILD. This review summarises the history of PROMs in ILD, shortcomings of the existing tools, challenges of development, validation and implementation of their use in clinical trials, and the discussion held during the meeting. Development of disease-specific PROMs for ILD including IPF with robust methodology and validation in concordance with guidance from regulatory authorities have increased user confidence in PROMs. Minimal clinically important difference for bidirectional changes may need to be developed. Cross-cultural validation and linguistic adaptations are necessary in addition to robust psychometric properties for effective PROM use in multinational clinical trials. PROM burden of use should be reduced through appropriate use of digital technologies and computerised adaptive testing. Active patient engagement in all stages from development, testing, choosing and implementation of PROMs can help improve probability of success and further growth.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite widely appreciated barriers to successful clinical implementation, the literature regarding how to operationalize electronic health record-integrated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) remains sparse. We offer a detailed summary of the implementation of PROs into the standard of care at a major tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: Collection of four Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests was piloted in a large academic orthopaedic surgery ambulatory clinic starting in October 2016. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests (Physical Function, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, and Ability to Return to Social Roles and Activities) were initially implemented as manual order sets to be administered before surgery through 2 years after surgery. Completion rate over time, mean time to completion for all PRO domains, and the overall distribution of symptom severity were used to evaluate the success of the pilot. A subsequent optimization and redesign of the pilot was conducted using tablets, automation of questionnaire deployment, and improved results review to address obstacles encountered during the pilot phase. RESULTS: Two thousand nine distinct joint arthroplasty patients (mean age = 65) completed at least one set of PRO assessments, with overall completion rates reaching 68% and mean completion time of 3 minutes. Focal points during the implementation process included engagement and training of staff, selection of an appropriate patient population and outcome measures, and user friendly data displays for patients and providers. CONCLUSION: Our pilot program successfully demonstrated that PROs can be administered, scored, and made immediately available within the electronic health record to patients and their providers with minimal disruption of clinical workflows. Although considerable operational and technological challenges remain, we found that the implementation of PROs in clinical care within an ambulatory practice at an academic medical center can be achieved through a constellation of several key factors.

AB  - The Infant Toddler Activity Card Sort (ITACS) is a new measure that engages caregivers in goal development by measuring participation in early childhood. Initial evaluation of the ITACS is required to assess its psychometric properties. To evaluate test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and between-group differences of the ITACS. Caregivers (N = 208) of children 0-3 years, who were typically developing (TD) or had a developmental delay (DD), completed the ITACS and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) with repeat assessment after 2 weeks later (n = 117). The ITACS demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with the PEDI-CAT. Children with DD had significantly more activity concerns on the ITACS than TD. Adequate test-retest reliability was not achieved. The ITACS is a useful tool for identifying caregiver concerns in activity engagement; interventions can be tailored to address concerns and increase participation in childhood routines.

AB  - AIM: This case report was designed to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation on improving upper extremity function for a child with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. METHODS: In addition to conventional therapies completed three times per week, the participant engaged in virtual reality rehabilitation with the Neofect Smart Kids five to seven days per week for six weeks totaling just over twelve hours of intervention time. Outcome measures were administered pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6-weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: Varying levels of improvement in motor function, quality of movement, and functional use were observed during intervention evidenced by improved scores on the following standardized assessments: Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, Second Edition; the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test; and the Pediatric Evaluation and Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test. The participant maintained improvements in motor skills at 6-weeks post intervention, however, the quality of his movements and overall frequency of use with his affected upper extremity decreased in the 6-weeks following termination of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the results are not generalizable, the VR intervention for this child allowed for greater movement repetition and improved functional upper extremity use.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe functional and skeletal muscle changes observed during pediatric critical illness and recovery and their association with health-related quality of life. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single multidisciplinary PICU. PATIENTS: Children with greater than or equal to 1 organ dysfunction, expected PICU stay greater than or equal to 48 hours, expected survival to discharge, and without progressive neuromuscular disease or malignancies were followed from admission to approximately 6.7 months postdischarge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional status was measured using the Functional Status Scale score and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test. Patient and parental health-related quality of life were measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and Short Form-36 questionnaires, respectively. Quadriceps muscle size, echogenicity, and fat thickness were measured using ultrasonography during PICU stay, at hospital discharge, and follow-up. Factors affecting change in muscle were explored. Associations between functional, muscle, and health-related quality of life changes were compared using regression analysis. Seventy-three survivors were recruited, of which 44 completed follow-ups. Functional impairment persisted in four of 44 (9.1%) at 6.7 months (interquartile range, 6-7.7 mo) after discharge. Muscle size decreased during PICU stay and was associated with inadequate energy intake (adjusted beta, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.28; p = 0.030). No change in echogenicity or fat thickness was observed. Muscle growth postdischarge correlated with mobility function scores (adjusted beta, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09; p = 0.046). Improvements in mobility scores were associated with improved physical health-related quality of life at follow-up (adjusted beta, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.23-1.81; p = 0.013). Child physical health-related quality of life at hospital discharge was associated with parental physical health-related quality of life (adjusted beta, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.17; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle decreased in critically ill children, which was associated with energy inadequacy and impaired muscle growth postdischarge. Muscle changes correlated with change in mobility, which was associated with child health-related quality of life. Mobility, child health-related quality of life, and parental health-related quality of life appeared to be interlinked.

AB  - The increasing use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures is forcing clinicians and health care systems to decide which to select and how to incorporate them into their records and clinical workflows. This overview addresses 3 topics related to these concerns. First, a literature review summarizes key psychometric and practical factors (such as reliability, responsiveness, computer adaptive testing, and interpretability) in choosing PROs for clinical practice. Second, 3 clinical decision support issues are highlighted: gathering PROs, electronic health record effect on providers, and incorporating PROs into clinical decision support design and implementation. Lastly, the salience of crosscutting domains as well as 9 key pragmatic decisions are reviewed. Crosscutting domains are those that are relevant across most medical and mental health conditions, such as the SPADE symptom pentad (sleep problems, pain, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue) and physical functioning. The 9 pragmatic decisions include (1) generic vs disease-specific scales; (2) single- vs multidomain scales; (3) universal scales vs user-choice selection; (4) number of domains to measure; (5) prioritization of domains when multiple domains are assessed; (6) action thresholds; (7) clinical purpose (screening vs monitoring); as well as the (8) frequency and (9) logistical aspects of PRO administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) and the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version of the EORTC quality-of-life questionnaire QLQ-C30 have been proposed as new PRO measures in oncology; however, their implementation in patients undergoing cancer surgery has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective abdominal cancer surgery were enrolled in a prospective multicenter study, and postoperative complications were recorded according to the Dindo-Clavien classification. Patients reported PRO data using the CAT EORTC QLQ-C30 and the PRO-CTCAE to measure 12 core cancer symptoms. Patients were followed-up for 6 months postoperatively. The study was carried out by medical students of the CHIR-Net SIGMA study network. RESULTS: Data of 303 patients were obtained and analyzed across 15 sites. PRO-CTCAE symptoms 'poor appetite', 'fatigue', 'exhaustion' and 'sleeping problems' increased after surgery and climaxed 10-30 days postoperatively. At 3-6 months postoperatively, no PRO-CTCAE symptom differed significantly to baseline. Patients reported higher 'social functioning' (p = 0.021) and overall quality-of-life scores (p < 0.05) 6 months after cancer surgery compared with the baseline level. There was a lack of correlation between postoperative complications or death and any of the PRO items evaluated. Feasibility endpoints for student-led research were met. CONCLUSION: The two novel PRO questionnaires were successfully applied in surgical oncology. Postoperative complications do not affect health-reported quality-of-life or common cancer symptoms following major cancer surgery. The feasibility of student-led multicenter clinical research was demonstrated, but might be enhanced by improved student training.

AB  - Despite its widespread use and low complication rates, arthroscopic meniscectomy has not been uniformly successful in all patients, especially in those with concurrent osteoarthritis. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health to develop and validate patient-reported outcomes for clinical research and practice. PROMIS has shown the ability to enhance and standardize measurement of a variety of health domains affecting musculoskeletal function and in discriminating between various orthopaedic procedures through the use of computer adaptive testing. Preoperative PROMIS scores are valid predictors of postoperative minimal clinically important difference in patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy based on preoperative decreased physical function and increased pain interference. PROMIS score cutoffs may be used by arthroscopic surgeons to counsel patients considering arthroscopic meniscectomy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of refractive error-specific quality of life (QoL) item banks and assess their performance using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) simulations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study a 392-item questionnaire, grouped under 11 QoL domains, was interviewer-administered to 305 people with refractive error [mean age +/- S.D., 30.5 +/- 14.1 (range (18 to 83) years; male, 50.5%; mean +/- S.D. spherical equivalent refractive error -2.4 +/- 2.9 (range: -15.0 to +11.0) Dioptres; spectacles (n = 257), contact lens (n = 37), refractive surgery (n = 25), uncorrected refractive error (n = 57)]. Rasch analysis was conducted on each QoL domain using the Andrich rating scale model to investigate parameters including response category functioning, person- and item-reliability, infit and outfit statistics, unidimensionality, targeting, differential item functioning and local item dependency. The resulting item banks underwent CAT simulations in 1,000 cases with 'high' and 'moderate' precision stopping rules. RESULTS: Rasch analysis iterations resulted in 13 refractive error-specific item banks (Convenience, Health concerns, Economic, Activity limitation, Mobility, Emotional, Social, Visual symptoms frequency, Visual symptoms severity, Visual symptoms bothersome, Comfort symptoms frequency, Comfort symptoms severity and Comfort symptoms bothersome), containing a total of 366 items. The item banks had good psychometric properties including satisfactory measurement precision, infit and outfit statistics and unidimensionality. In CAT simulations, the mean number of items required to achieve high and moderate measurement precision was 9.4 and 4.7, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, refractive error-specific QoL item banks show promise in their ability to comprehensively and precisely evaluate a range of quality of life parameters. These items banks when administered using a CAT system offer unique outcome tools for implementation in clinical trials, healthcare and research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to be a responsive and efficient measure for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. While these studies were rigorous in their protocol and methodology, no efforts in recent literature have been made to identify if these reference scores apply to elite athletes. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in the baseline scores of elite athletes versus the general population. We hypothesized that athletes' PROMIS upper extremity general function (PROMIS-UE) and general physical function (PROMIS-PF) scores would vary substantially from the mean health state of the general population. We further hypothesized that these scores would be affected by specific sport and level of competition. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Three PROMIS computer adaptive test (CAT) domains were administered to elite athlete (>/=18 years) volunteers (either in person or through email). An elite athlete was defined as one participating in sports at the collegiate level or higher. Test domains included PROMIS-PF, PROMIS-UE, and pain interference (PROMIS-PI). PROMIS domain t scores were defined and assessed against NIH reference values to identify significant differences. Distribution analysis was conducted using histograms and normality assessments. Domains were also subject to correlation analysis. Finally, subgroup analysis was conducted for all athlete characteristics to identify any factors associated with variance. RESULTS: In total, 196 elite athletes (mean age, 21.1 years; range, 18.0-36.7 years) completed all 3 PROMIS-CAT forms. Overall, the mean scores were 56.0 +/- 6.4, 58.1 +/- 7.7, and 47.1 +/- 7.3 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and PROMIS-PI, respectively. Distribution analysis showed nonnormal distribution for all 3 PROMIS domains (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P < .001). Similarly, in all 3 PROMIS domains the athletes displayed more disparate scores than the NIH-reported reference values (1-way sign test, P < .001). Only the presence of pain and sport played showed association with variance in PROMIS domain scores (P < .001 and P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Elite athletes displayed more disparate reference scores than the NIH-reported average of 50 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and PROMIS-PI. Furthermore, these forms were sensitive to varying levels of sport among collegiate athletes.

AB  - AIMS: The increase in prescription opioid misuse and dependence is now a public health crisis in the UK. It is recognized as a whole-person problem that involves both the medical and the psychosocial needs of patients. Analyzing aspects of pathophysiology, emotional health, and social wellbeing associated with persistent opioid use after injury may inform safe and effective alleviation of pain while minimizing risk of misuse or dependence. Our objectives were to investigate patient factors associated with opioid use two to four weeks and six to nine months after an upper limb fracture. METHODS: A total of 734 patients recovering from an isolated upper limb fracture were recruited in this study. Opioid prescription was documented retrospectively for the period preceding the injury, and prospectively at the two- to four-week post-injury visit and six- to nine-month post-injury visit. Bivariate and multivariate analysis sought factors associated with opioid prescription from demographics, injury-specific data, Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Instrumentation System (PROMIS), Depression computer adaptive test (CAT), PROMIS Anxiety CAT, PROMIS Instrumental Support CAT, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ-2), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11), and measures that investigate levels of social support. RESULTS: A new prescription of opioids two to four weeks after injury was independently associated with less social support (odds ratio (OR) 0.26, p < 0.001), less instrumental support (OR 0.91, p < 0.001), and greater symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.1, p < 0.001). A new prescription of opioids six to nine months after injury was independently associated with less instrumental support (OR 0.9, p < 0.001) and greater symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that potentially modifiable psychosocial factors are associated with increased acute and chronic opioid prescriptions following upper limb fracture. Surgeons prescribing opioids for upper limb fractures should be made aware of the screening and management of emotional and social health. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(2):119-124.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe relationships between negative emotions and perceived emotional support in parents of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study conducted face-to-face interviews between January 2019 and January 2020. Study variables included depression (PHQ-9 Scale), anxiety (Emotional Distress-Anxiety-Short Form 8a), anger (Emotional Distress-Anger-Short Form 5a), fear (Fear-Affect Computerized Adaptive Test), somatic fear (Fear-Somatic Arousal-Fixed Form), loneliness (Revised 20-item UCLA Loneliness Scale), and perceived emotional support (Emotional Support-Fixed Form). RESULTS: Eighty parents reported symptoms of depression 8.00(4.00, 13.75), anxiety (23.43 +/- 7.80), anger (13.40 +/- 5.46), fear (72.81 +/- 27.26), somatic fear 9.00(6.00, 12.75), loneliness (39.35 +/- 12.00), and low perceived emotional support (32.14 +/- 8.06). Parents who were young, single, low-income, and with limited-post secondary education reported greater loneliness and lower perceived emotional support. Fear correlated with depression (r = 0.737, P < 0.01) and anxiety (r=0.900, P < 0.01). Inverse relationships were discovered between perceived emotional support and loneliness (r = -0.767, P < 0.01), anger (r=-0.401, P < 0.01), and depression (r = -0.334, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of negative emotions identified will serve as potential targets for future interventions designed to enhance support for parents of critically ill children.

CY  - NA
AB  - PURPOSE: To calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Computer Adaptive Test (UE CAT) and Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) for ligament reconstruction tendon interposition (LRTI) patients. METHODS: Adult patients treated with LRTI for trapeziometacarpal OA by fellowship-trained hand surgeons between December 2014 and February 2018 at an academic tertiary institution were included. Outcomes were prospectively collected at each visit by tablet computer, including the QuickDASH, PROMIS UE, Pain Interference, Depression, and Anxiety CATs. Inclusion required a response to the anchor question "How much relief and/or improvement do you feel you have experienced as a result of your treatment?" on a 6-option Likert scale, as well as preoperative (</=120 days before surgery) and follow-up (2-26 weeks) outcomes. We calculated MCID both by an anchor-based approach using the mean score of the minimal change group, and with the 0.5 SD method. RESULTS: Of 145 included participants, mean age was 63 +/- 8 years and 74% were female. Anchor-based MCID estimates for the total cohort were 4.2 for the PROMIS UE CAT and 8.8 for the QuickDASH. The MCID estimates using the 0.5 SD method were 4.8 and 11.7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We propose MCID values of 4.2 to 4.8 for the PROMIS UE CAT and 8.8 to 11.7 for the QuickDASH when powering clinical studies or when assessing improvement among a cohort of patients who have undergone LRTI surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Minimal clinically important difference estimates are helpful when interpreting clinical outcomes after LRTI and for powering prospective trials.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The most frequently used measures of facial emotion recognition (FER) are insufficiently comprehensive, reliable, valid, and efficient; moreover, the impact of gender on scoring has not been controlled. OBJECTIVE: To develop a computerized adaptive test of FER for adults with schizophrenia. DESIGN: First, we selected photographs from a published database. Second, items that fitted well to a Rasch model were used to form the item bank. Third and last, we determined the best administration mode for prospective users to achieve both high reliability and efficiency. SETTING: Psychiatric hospitals and the community. PARTICIPANTS: Adults living with schizophrenia (n = 351) and adults without diagnosed mental illness (n = 101). RESULTS: After removal of misfit items (infit or outfit >/=1.4), the remaining 165 items were selected to form an item bank. Among them, 39 showed severe gender bias, so the item difficulties were adjusted accordingly. On the basis of the item bank, two administration modes were recommended for prospective users. The reliable mode required approximately 128 items (nearly 20 min) to achieve reliability (.72-.81), similar to that of the entire item bank. The efficient mode required approximately 73 items (approximate 11 min) to provide acceptable reliability (.69-.73) for the seven domain scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our newly developed measure provides comprehensive, valid, and unbiased (to examinees' gender) assessments of FER in adults living with schizophrenia. In addition, the administration modes can be flexibly changed to optimize the reliability or efficiency for prospective users. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: This newly developed FER measure can help occupational therapists identify deficits in recognizing specific basic emotions and plan corresponding interventions to manage the impact on their clients' social functions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computerised adaptive testing (CAT) has the potential to transform plastic surgery outcome measurement by making patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) shorter, individualised and more accurate than pen-and-paper questionnaires. OBJECTIVES: This paper reports the results of two optimisation studies for the CLEFT-Q CAT, a CAT intended for use in the field of cleft lip and/or palate. Specifically, we aimed to identify the optimal score estimation and item selection methods for using this CAT in clinical practice. These represent two major components of any CAT algorithm. METHOD: Monte Carlo simulations were performed using simulated data in the R statistical computing environment and incorporated a range of score estimation and item selection techniques. The performance and accuracy of the CAT was assessed by mean items administered, correlation between CAT scores and paired linear assessment scores, and the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of these score pairs. RESULTS: The accuracy of the CLEFT-Q CAT was not significantly affected by the choice of score estimation or item selection method. Sub-scales which originally contain more items were amenable to greater item reduction with CAT. CONCLUSION: This study shows that score estimation and item selection methods that need minimal processing power can be used in the CLEFT-Q CAT without compromising accuracy. This means that the CLEFT-Q CAT could be administered quickly and efficiently with basic hardware demands. We recommend the use of less computationally intensive techniques in future CLEFT-Q CAT studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: This exploratory qualitative research was conducted to understand the quality of life (QoL) impacts of adult uveitis to develop a uveitis QoL item bank, and we present here the results of qualitative analysis of uveitis patient experience.METHODS: A qualitative approach with phenomenological study design was employed to explore the common QoL domains in uveitis. Data were collected using focus groups and face-to-face interviews. The sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically. NViVo software was used to perform qualitative analysis.RESULTS: Eight focus groups and 10 interviews were conducted with 41 patients with uveitis. Seven QoL domains were identified, namely symptoms, emotional, activity limitation, health concerns, convenience, social, and economic impact. Although these QoL domains have been previously identified in other eye diseases, the sub-themes within each QoL domain were unique to uveitis. Participants described a variety of symptoms including increased light sensitivity, blurred vision, pain, redness, and tearing. Participants repeatedly described feeling frustrated due to prognostic uncertainty and associated discomfort. Participants were concerned about the frequent relapses of inflammation, as well as side-effects from long-term systemic medications. Uveitis affected their ability to perform daily tasks such as using computers, driving, and reading books. Direct financial impacts included reduced work hours and the costs of treatment and specialist care.CONCLUSION: Participants with uveitis experience many symptoms in addition to medication-related inconveniences and activity limitations. The QoL issues identified will be used to develop a uveitis-specific QoL item bank.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the increasing incidence of orthopaedic surgeries, there is a lack of data reporting on patient experience and recovery following surgery. As such, there is a need to better characterize the natural history of pain interference (PI) after orthopaedic surgery to better manage patients' expectations and recovery. PURPOSE: To identify factors associated with greater pain interference two weeks following orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: All patients undergoing elective outpatient orthopaedic surgery at a single urban academic institution were evaluated preoperatively from August 2016 to March 2018. Patients completed a baseline assessment consisting of demographic information, PROMIS computer adaptive testing in 6 domains including Pain Interference (PI), Physical Function, Social Satisfaction, Fatigue, Anxiety, and Depression. Two weeks following surgery, patients completed the same questionnaires along with assessments of Improvement and Satisfaction. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed. Categorical data was compared with ANOVA and continuous data was compared with Spearman's correlation coefficient (r(s)). RESULTS: 435 patients (age = 41.1 +/- 15.7, 47% female) were studied. Mean PI was 60.1 +/- 7.0 prior to surgery and 61.7 +/- 7.6 at 2 weeks postoperative. Worse 2 week PROMIS PI was associated with lower extremity surgery, prior surgery on the joint, preoperative opioid use, depression, lower income, lower education, and higher ASA score (p < 0.05). Better 2 week PROMIS PI was correlated with better baseline and better 2 week scores on all outcome measures. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that lower extremity surgery, worse preoperative pain scores, and worse preoperative pain interference were independent predictors of worse pain interference after surgery. CONCLUSION: Early postoperative pain interference is associated with function, demographic, and psychosocial factors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our primary purpose was to evaluate the reliability of telephone administration of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity (UE) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) version 2.0 in a hand and upper extremity population, and secondarily to make comparisons with the abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH). METHODS: Patients more than 1 year out from hand surgeries performed at a single tertiary institution were enrolled. Half of the patients completed telephone PROMIS UE CAT and QuickDASH surveys first, followed by computer-based surveys 1 to 10 days later, and the other half completed them in the reverse order. Telephone surveys were readministered 2 to 6 weeks later to evaluate test-retest reliability. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) were used to assess agreement between telephone and computer-based scores, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability. The proportion of patients with discrepancies in follow-up scores that exceeded estimates of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was evaluated. RESULTS: For the 89 enrolled patients, the PROMIS UE CAT CCC was 0.82 (83% confidence interval [83% CI], 0.77-0.86; good), which was significantly lower than 0.92 (83% CI, 0.89-0.94; good to excellent) for the QuickDASH. The PROMIS UE CAT ICC did not differ significantly from the QuickDASH (0.85 and 0.91, respectively). Differences in telephone versus computer scores exceeded 5 points (MCID estimate) for the PROMIS UE CAT in 34% of patients versus 5% of patients exceeding 14 points (MCID estimate) for the QuickDASH. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly better reliability was observed for the QuickDASH than the PROMIS UE CAT when comparing telephone with computer-based score acquisition. Over one-third of patients demonstrated a clinically relevant difference in scores between the telephone and the computer-administered tests. We conclude that the PROMIS UE CAT should only be administered through computer-based methods. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that differences in collection methods for the PROMIS UE CAT may systematically affect the scores obtained, which may erroneously influence the interpretation of postoperative scores for hand surgery patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the relationship between psychological distress and activity tolerance (capability), a stressful life event might diminish accommodation, increase symptoms, and induce a person to seek specialty care. As a first step to investigate this possibility, this study addressed whether difficult life events are associated with greater activity intolerance and pain intensity. METHODS: A cohort of 127 patients seeking specialty care for lower extremity symptoms completed questionnaires that inquired about difficult life events within the last 12 months as derived from the Holmes Rahe Life Stress Inventory, and recorded pain intensity on an 11-point ordinal scale, activity tolerance [Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test (CAT)], symptoms of anxiety (GAD-2; 2 item version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), symptoms of depression (PROMIS Depression CAT), self-efficacy when in pain (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, 2 question version), and demographics. The treating clinician indicated if the disease was established (e.g. arthritis) or relatively new (e.g. sprain/strain). Bivariate and multivariable analyses sought factors associated with activity intolerance and pain intensity. RESULTS: Greater activity intolerance was associated with difficult life events in bivariate analyses (t = 2.13, MD = 3.18, 95% C.I. = 0.22-6.13, p = 0.04) and in multivariable analyses that excluded symptoms of depression. Greater pain intensity was not associated with difficult life events, but was associated with surgeon rating of established disease (beta = 1.20, 95% C.I. = 0.33-2.08, p < 0.01), greater symptoms of anxiety (MD = 3.35, s = 1.72; rho = 0.30, p < 0.01), and less education (beta =  - 1.06, 95% C.I. =  - 1.94- - 0.18, p = 0.02) (no college degree). CONCLUSION: When a musculoskeletal specialist identifies less activity tolerance (less capability) than anticipated for a given injury or pathology, they can anticipate a potential difficult life event, and expect alleviation of symptoms and improved capability as the stress is ameliorated with time and support. Specialists can be prepared to direct people to community or professional support if requested.

AB  - A central but challenging problem in genetic studies is to test for (usually weak) associations between a complex trait (e.g., a disease status) and sets of multiple genetic variants. Due to the lack of a uniformly most powerful test, data-adaptive tests, such as the adaptive sum of powered score (aSPU) test, are advantageous in maintaining high power against a wide range of alternatives. However, there is often no closed-form to accurately and analytically calculate the p-values of many adaptive tests like aSPU, thus Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are often used, which can be time consuming to achieve a stringent significance level (e.g., 5e-8) used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To estimate such a small p-value, we need a huge number of MC simulations (e.g., 1e+10). As an alternative, we propose using importance sampling to speed up such calculations. We develop some theory to motivate a proposed algorithm for the aSPU test, and show that the proposed method is computationally more efficient than the standard MC simulations. Using both simulated and real data, we demonstrate the superior performance of the new method over the standard MC simulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in activity intolerance for a given musculoskeletal pathophysiology. In other words, people often experience illness beyond what one would expect given their level of pathophysiology. Mental health (i.e., cognitive bias regarding pain [e.g., worst-case thinking] and psychological distress [symptoms of anxiety and depression]) is an important and treatable correlate of pain intensity and activity intolerance that accounts for much of this variation. This study tested the degree to which psychological distress accentuates the role of cognitive bias in the relationship between pain intensity and activity intolerance. METHODS: We enrolled 125 adults with musculoskeletal illness in a cross-sectional study. Participants completed measures of activity intolerance related to pain (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Pain Interference Computer Adaptive Test [CAT]) and in general (PROMIS Physical Function CAT]), measures of psychological distress (PROMIS Depression CAT and PROMIS Anxiety CAT), a numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain intensity, measures of pain-related cognitive bias (4-question versions of the Negative Pain Thoughts Questionnaire [NPTQ-4], Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS-4], and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia [TSK-4]), and a survey of demographic variables. We assessed the relationships of these measures through mediation and moderation analyses using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Mediation analysis confirmed the large indirect relationship between pain intensity (NRS) and activity intolerance (PROMIS Pain Interference CAT and Physical Function CAT) through cognitive bias. Symptoms of depression and anxiety had an unconditional (consistent) relationship with cognitive bias (NPTQ), but there was no significant conditional effect/moderation (i.e., no increase in the magnitude of the relationship with increasing symptoms of depression and anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress accentuates the role of cognitive bias in the relationship between pain intensity and activity intolerance. In other words, misconceptions make humans ill, more so with greater symptoms of depression or anxiety. Orthopaedic surgeons can approach their daily work with the knowledge that addressing common misconceptions and identifying psychological distress as a health improvement opportunity are important aspects of musculoskeletal care.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop the Chinese version of the Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Emotional Distress item bank version 2.0-both conceptually equivalent to the original and relevant in the Chinese culture. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress item bank was translated, following the standard Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) translation methodology, by a translation team. Eight children aged 8-17 years from the general population were cognitively interviewed. RESULTS: Most items were well understood by children, and some revisions were made after the cognitive interviewing based on the suggestions of the interviewees. The Chinese version of the Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress-v2.0 item bank was conceptually and semantically equivalent to the original. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The Chinese version of the Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress item bank is now available for further studies to develop computer adaptive tests (CATs). Future CAT version measures may become a new standard measure for children in the general population and those living with a chronic condition in China.

TI  - Effect of the Wingman-Connect Upstream Suicide Prevention Program for Air Force Personnel in Training: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial.
JO  - JAMA network open
VL  - 3
PY  - 2020
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Suicide has been a leading manner of death for US Air Force personnel in recent years. Universal prevention programs that reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors in military populations have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Wingman-Connect program for Airmen-in-training reduces suicidal ideation, depression, and occupational problems compared with a stress management program and to test the underlying network health model positing that cohesive, healthy units are protective against suicidal ideation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 2017 to October 2019 and compared classes of personnel followed up for 6 months. The setting was a US Air Force technical training school, with participants studied to their first base assignment, whether US or international. Participants in 216 classes were randomized, with an 84% retention rate. Data analysis was performed from November 2019 to May 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The Wingman-Connect program used group skill building for cohesion, shared purpose, and managing career and personal stressors (3 blocks of 2 hours each). Stress management training covered cognitive and behavioral strategies (2 hours). Both conditions had a 1-hour booster session, plus text messages. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were scores on the suicidal ideation and depression scales of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health and self-reports of military occupational impairment. Class network protective factors hypothesized to mediate the effect of Wingman-Connect were assessed with 4 measures: cohesion assessed perceptions that classmates cooperate, work well together, and support each other; morale was measured with a single item used in other studies with military samples; healthy class norms assessed perceptions of behaviors supported by classmates; and bonds to classmates were assessed by asking each participant to name classmates whom they respect and would choose to spend time with. RESULTS: A total of 215 classes including 1485 individuals (1222 men [82.3%]; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [3.1] years) participated; 748 individuals were enrolled in the Wingman-Connect program and 737 individuals were enrolled in the stress management program. At 1 month, the Wingman-Connect group reported lower suicidal ideation severity (effect size [ES], -0.23; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.09; P = .001) and depression symptoms (ES, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.08; P = .002) and fewer occupational problems (ES, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.02; P = .02). At 6 months, the Wingman-Connect group reported lower depression symptoms (ES, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02; P = .03), whereas the difference in suicidal ideation severity was not significant (ES, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.29 to 0.01; P = .06). The number needed to treat to produce 1 fewer participant with elevated depression at either follow-up point was 21. The benefits of the training on occupational problems did not extend past 1 month. The Wingman-Connect program strengthened cohesive, healthy class units, which helped reduce suicidal ideation severity (estimate, -0.035; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; P = .02) and depression symptom scores (estimate, -0.039; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; P = .02) at 1 month. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Wingman-Connect is the first universal prevention program to reduce suicidal ideation and depression symptoms in a general Air Force population. Group training that builds cohesive, healthy military units is promising for upstream suicide prevention and may be essential for ecological validity. Extension of the program to the operational Air Force is recommended for maintaining continuity and testing the prevention impact on suicidal behavior.

AB  - An adaptive task difficulty assignment method which we reckon as balanced difficulty task finder (BDTF) is proposed in this paper. The aim is to recommend tasks to a learner using a trade-off between skills of the learner and difficulty of the tasks such that the learner experiences a state of flow during the learning. Flow is a mental state that psychologists refer to when someone is completely immersed in an activity. Flow state is a multidisciplinary field of research and has been studied not only in psychology, but also neuroscience, education, sport, and games. The idea behind this paper is to try to achieve a flow state in a similar way as Elo's chess skill rating (Glickman in Am Chess J 3:59-102) and TrueSkill (Herbrich et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems, 2006) for matching game players, where "matched players" should possess similar capabilities and skills in order to maintain the level of motivation and involvement in the game. The BDTF draws analogy between choosing an appropriate opponent or appropriate game level and automatically choosing an appropriate difficulty level of a learning task. This method, as an intelligent tutoring system, could be used in a wide range of applications from online learning environments and e-learning, to learning and remembering techniques in traditional methods such as adjusting delayed matching to sample and spaced retrieval training that can be used for people with memory problems such as people with dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative patient expectations and met expectations are likely associated with the outcome of treatment. However, there is a lack of data regarding the preoperative expectations and early postoperative met expectations of patients undergoing extremity orthopaedic surgery. The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of early postoperative met expectations in a cohort of patients undergoing extremity orthopaedic surgery and to assess the relationship between patient expectations and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. We hypothesized that patients with higher preoperative expectation scores and higher postoperative met expectation scores would have better early postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Four hundred thirty-five patients age seventeen and older who underwent extremity orthopaedic surgery at one institution were prospectively enrolled in this study. Each patient completed a preoperative questionnaire that included an assessment of demographics, pain, function, general health, treatment expectations, activity level, and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing. Expectations were evaluated using the Expectations Domain of the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System (MODEMS) questionnaire. Patients completed a follow-up questionnaire two weeks after surgery that also assessed MODEMS met expectations and satisfaction (Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8)). RESULTS: The mean preoperative expectation score was 86.95 +/- 16.59, and the mean postoperative met expectation score was 55.02 +/- 27.63 (0-100 scale with 100 representing the highest level of expectations). Greater met expectations were significantly associated with white race (p = 0.025), college degree (p = 0.011), and higher income (p = 0.002). Greater met expectations were also significantly associated with greater postoperative physical function, social satisfaction, activity level, and subjective improvement, as well as lower pain interference, joint pain, body pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.01 for each). Multivariable analysis results found that less postoperative joint pain and greater postoperative social satisfaction, improvement, and physical function were all significant independent predictors of greater met expectations at two weeks postoperative (p < 0.01 for each). CONCLUSION: Greater preoperative expectations are associated with better activity and less pain two weeks after surgery. Met expectations of extremity orthopaedic surgery were associated with postoperative physical function, social satisfaction, activity, pain, anxiety, depression, and subjective improvement. These results may have implications for preoperative counseling and risk factor modification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The healthcare industry is shifting its focus from traditional clinical outcome measures to patient satisfaction metrics. This change has caused orthopaedic surgeons to become increasingly interested in factors influencing patient satisfaction, which would allow them to potentially modify these factors in an effort to increase postoperative satisfaction. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with patient satisfaction two weeks following extremity orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Patients completed questionnaires preoperatively to assess demographics, activity, pain, expectations, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing for Physical Function, Pain Interference, Social Satisfaction, Depression, Anxiety, and Fatigue. Two weeks after their operation, patients completed the same questionnaires in addition to an Improvement Survey and Met Expectations. Satisfaction was assessed with the Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: Greater surgical satisfaction two weeks following orthopaedic surgery was associated with higher education, alcohol use, better scores on all PROMIS domains at baseline and two weeks, greater activity levels at baseline and two weeks, less bodily pain at baseline and two weeks, less pain in the surgical site at two weeks, greater met expectations, and greater improvement (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides important information about patient satisfaction two weeks after orthopaedic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) has traditionally focused on motor aspects. The extent to which sensory processing disorders can affect their functional performance and quality of life (QoL) is uncertain. This study aimed to explore the differences in sensory processing between UCP and typical development (TD) children and to analyze the relationship of sensory processing with functional performance and QoL. METHODS: Fifty-three children aged from 6 to 15 years (TD = 24; UCP = 26) were recruited. The Child Sensory Profile 2, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test and Kidscreen were used to evaluate sensory processing, functional performance and QoL. RESULTS: UCP children showed sensory processing difficulties (avoidance: p = 0.02; registration: p = 0.00; body position: p = 0.00; oral: p = 0.02; social-emotional: p = 0.01), and scored lower in functional performance (daily activities: p = 0.00; mobility: p = 0.00; social/cognitive: p = 0.04) and in physical well-being (p = 0.00). The highest correlations in UCP group were found between proprioceptive processing and daily activities and mobility (r = -0.39); auditory, visual and tactile information and school environment (r = -0.63; r = -0.51; r = -0.46); behavioral and social-emotional responses and psychological well-being (r = -0.64; r = -0.49). CONCLUSIONS: UCP children have greater difficulty in sensory processing than TD children. Difficulties in proprioceptive processing contribute to poorer functional performance. Auditory, visual and tactile processing is associated with participation in the school environment and behavioral and social-emotional responses related to sensory processing are associated with the psychological well-being.

AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached, and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the PROMIS Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping rule overall and particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Comparative cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in children and adolescents with varying extent of spinal deformity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several PROMs have been proposed to help assess health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in pediatric spinal deformity surgery and research, but it is unclear which are sensitive to deformity severity. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with spinal asymmetry or juvenile/adolescent idiopathic scoliosis completed the patient-reported outcomes management information system (PROMIS) pediatric computer adaptive test bank (Domains: Mobility, Pain Interference, Physical Activity, Physical Stress Experiences, Psychological Stress Experiences), Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r), Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS Pedi-FABS) activity scale, and Trunk Appearance Perception Scale. Patients were grouped as spinal asymmetry, mild deformity, and substantial deformity by major Cobb angle measuring less than 10 degrees , between 10 degrees  and 40 degrees , and greater than 40 degrees  respectively. One-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post-hoc correction was used to determine score differences between groups. RESULTS: Final analyses included 206 patients, of which 135 (66%) were female. The mean age was 13.0 +/- 2.2 years, and the mean major Cobb angle was 20.1 +/- 14.1 degrees  (range: 0-74.2 degrees ). Compared with both spinal asymmetry and mild deformity patients, patients with substantial deformity reported worse outcomes, including lower function, more pain, and decreased psychological health by legacy PROMs and PROMIS. PROMIS Physical Activity and Psychological Stress Experiences did not capture any significant differences between all groups. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the spinal asymmetry and mild deformity groups for all PROMs measured. CONCLUSION: Patients with substantial spinal deformity reported lower activity and function, more pain, and greater physical and psychological stress compared with patients without clinical spinal deformity by legacy PROMs and several PROMIS domains. As PROMIS Physical Activity and Psychological Stress Experiences did not capture these differences, these PROMs may measure different constructs than the legacy PROMs as they relate to spinal curvature and may be less relevant to measure HRQoL in this population.Level of Evidence 3.

AB  - Bronchiolitis is a common pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) illness and often affects generally healthy children, making it a promising disease in which to study long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We previously found that approximately 15% of critical bronchiolitis patients have evidence of post-PICU morbidity using coarse definitions available in administrative data sets. In this study, we measured neurodevelopmental outcomes using four more precise tools. Children who had previously been admitted to our PICU with bronchiolitis were included; those with evidence of developmental delay at PICU admission were excluded. Approximately 1 to 2 years after PICU discharge, the parent of each subject completed two questionnaires (Ages and Stages Questionnaire and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test). Each subject also underwent two in-person assessments administered by a certified examiner (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition, and the Amiel-Tison neurological assessment). For each domain of each test, a score of > 1 standard deviation below the norm for the subject's age defined "moderate" disability and a score >/= 2 standard deviations below the norm defined "severe" disability. Eighteen subjects (median ages of 3.7 months at PICU admission and 2.3 years at testing) were enrolled, 17 of whom were supported by high-flow nasal cannula and/or mechanical ventilation. Fifteen children (83%) scored abnormally on >/= 1test. Eight children (44%) had disabilities in >/= 3 domains and/or >/= 1 severe disability identified. Our findings that motor, language, and cognitive disabilities are commonly observed months to years after critical bronchiolitis require larger studies to confirm this finding, assess causality, and identify modifiable risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) results in significant physical, psycho-social and socioeconomic burden. Identifying efficient and reliable patient reported outcome measures is critical for research and clinical purposes. The NIH's Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments have not been compared to validated "legacy" instruments in older adults with cLBP. This study evaluates construct (convergent and discriminant) validity and time to complete (TTC) PROMIS as compared to legacy instruments. METHODS: We enrolled older Veterans (age 60+) with cLBP with/without leg pain scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Subjects completed PROMIS computer adaptive test item banks and corresponding legacy instruments in the following domains: pain intensity, interference, and behavior; functional status; depression and anxiety; fatigue; sleep and social functioning. Convergent and discriminant validity between PROMIS and legacy instruments was evaluated using Spearman rank order correlations; Mann-Whitney U tests compared TTC. RESULTS: Of the 71 Veterans recruited, the median (IQR) age was 67 (63-71) years old, 94% were men, 76% were White, 17% Black, and 96% were Non-Hispanic. Spearman correlations between PROMIS and legacy instruments showed moderate to very strong convergent validity in all domains (r = 0.4-1.0), except for social functioning and pain behavior (PROMIS Pain Behavior with Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire). The total median TTC for all PROMIS items was significantly shorter than legacy items, 8 min 50 s vs 29 min 14 s respectively, p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Given time efficiency of using PROMIS, along with strong construct validity, PROMIS instruments are a practical choice for measuring multidimensional PROs in older Veterans with cLBP for both research and clinical purposes.

AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluate efficiency, precision, and validity of RetCAT, which comprises ten diabetic retinopathy (DR) quality of life (QoL) computerized adaptive tests (CATs). METHODS: In this cross-sectional clinical study, 183 English and/or Mandarin-speaking participants with DR (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 56.4 +/- 11.9 years; 38% proliferative DR [worse eye]) were recruited from retinal clinics in Singapore. Participants answered the RetCAT tests (Symptoms, Activity Limitation, Mobility, Emotional, Health Concerns, Social, Convenience, Economic, Driving, and Lighting), which were capped at seven items each, and other questionnaires, and underwent eye tests. Our primary evaluation focused on RetCAT efficiency (i.e. standard error of measurement [SEM] +/- SD achieved and time needed to complete each CAT). Secondary evaluations included an assessment of RetCAT's test precision and validity. RESULTS: Mean SEM across all RetCAT tests was 0.351, ranging from 0.272 +/- 0.130 for Economic to 0.484 +/- 0.130 for Emotional. Four tests (Mobility, Social, Convenience, and Driving) had a high level of measurement error. The median time to take each RetCAT test was 1.79 minutes, ranging from 1.12 (IQR [interquartile range] 1.63) for Driving to 3.28 (IQR 2.52) for Activity Limitation. Test precision was highest for participants at the most impaired end of the spectrum. Most RetCAT tests displayed expected correlations with other scales (convergent/divergent validity) and were sensitive to DR and/or vision impairment severity levels (criterion validity). CONCLUSIONS: RetCAT can provide efficient, precise, and valid measurement of DR-related QoL impact. Future application of RetCAT will employ a stopping rule based on SE rather than number of items to ensure that all tests can detect meaningful differences in person abilities. Responsiveness of RetCAT to treatment interventions must also be determined. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: RetCAT may be useful for measuring the patient-centered impact of DR severity and disease progression and evaluating the effectiveness of new therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences in patient-physician interactions based on physician gender have been demonstrated. However, the association between patients' self-perceived health and their decision to see a female versus male physician is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine if self-reported physical or behavioral health is different in musculoskeletal patients who present to female vs male physicians. We hypothesized that patients who present to female physicians report worse physical and behavioral health. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Consecutive 21 980 adult patients who presented to a musculoskeletal medicine specialist for initial evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition between April 1, 2016 and November 1, 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression Computer Adaptive Test domains of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). The primary study outcome was the mean difference (MD) in PROMIS scores by physician gender. RESULTS: Patients who presented to female physicians self-reported slightly worse health in all domains: Physical Function (female physicians 40.2, male physicians 42.4, MD -2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.5 to -1.8), Pain Interference (female physicians 61.6, male physicians 60.4, MD 1.3 [1.0-1.5]), Anxiety (female physicians 52.5, male physicians 51.4, MD 1.1 [0.8-1.5]), and Depression (female physicians 47.5, male physicians 46.2, MD 1.3 [0.9-1.6]) (all P < .001). Patients who presented to female physicians were also slightly younger (51.9 vs 52.4 years, P = .034) and more likely to be female (63% vs 56%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who presented to female physicians self-reported slightly worse physical and behavioral health compared to those patients who presented to male physicians. Further investigation into this finding may provide insight into drivers of patients' preferences, which may enable physicians of both genders to optimize patient care.

AB  - Time use studies uncover the organization of daily routine of families of children with disabilities. The objective of this study is to identify determinants of time spent caring for children/adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typical development (TD). Participants were caregivers of children/adolescents with/without disability. Structural equation modeling tested a proposed model of time spent in child care. The variables in the model were as follows: questionnaire (families' socioeconomic status [SES]), children's functioning (The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test [PEDI-CAT]); hours of care (daily diaries), number of adaptations used, and help with child care (parents' report). Distinct variable combinations explained 78% of the variation in the time to care (TD model), followed by 42% (ASD) and 29% (CP). Adaptations indirectly affected time to care through its effect on functioning (CP); family's SES affected functioning through its effect on adaptation use (ASD). In conclusion, knowledge of factors affecting caregivers' time spent on children's care help occupational therapists implement family-centered strategies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective correlational study was to compare the psychometric properties of the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales with those of traditional legacy scales over a longitudinal postoperative period in patients undergoing arthroscopic procedures. METHODS: Active-duty military personnel undergoing shoulder and knee arthroscopic procedures completed the DVPRS, PROMIS, and legacy scales preoperatively and again at 3 months postoperatively. Rolling correlation coefficients (r(rm)) were used to assess the concurrent validity between the DVPRS average pain scores and computer adaptive testing PROMIS scales (Anxiety, Depression, Pain Behavior, Pain Interference, Mobility, Sleep Disturbance, Satisfaction With Social Roles, and Upper Extremity Physical Function) and the legacy scales (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] scale, Shoulder Activity Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] questionnaire, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation [SANE], Marx Activity Rating Scale, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey). RESULTS: A total of 121 participants completed the scales preoperatively, 80 completed them at 3 months postoperatively, and 59 (49% of participants) completed them at both times. Rolling correlation coefficients between PROMIS Pain Interference (r(rm) = -0.41, P = .006), Satisfaction With Social Roles (r(rm) = 0.56, P < .001), and Upper Extremity (r(rm) = 0.71, P < .001) scores showed acceptable concurrent validity with ASES scores over a longitudinal postoperative period. DVPRS scores (r(rm) = -0.69, P = .002) and PROMIS Pain Behavior (r(rm) = -0.57, P = .018), Pain Interference (r(rm) = -0.71, P = .001), Sleep Disturbance (r(rm) = -0.64, P = .005), and Mobility (r(rm) = 0.65, P = .005) scores showed acceptable concurrent validity with IKDC scores. There was poor correlation between the PROMIS and DVPRS scores and the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Marx Activity Rating Scale, Shoulder Activity Scale, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey scores. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS scales measuring physical function, pain presentation, and other health domains showed acceptable concurrent validity with ASES and IKDC scores. By integrating the prospective collection of biopsychosocial PROMIS scales into practice, it is possible for clinicians in orthopaedic settings to assess changes in validated patient-reported outcomes to inform patient-centered care planning throughout the postoperative recovery period. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective comparative study (with not all participants completing follow-up).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prechtl's general movements assessment (GMA) post-term has high predictive validity for cerebral palsy, but less is known about whether earlier GMA, including before term, are associated with other developmental problems. AIMS: To examine the relationships between GMA prior to term and at term-equivalent, with developmental outcomes at 4.5-5 years' corrected age. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: 122 very preterm infants born <30 weeks' gestation and 91 healthy term controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: GMA (categorised as 'normal' or 'abnormal') were assessed at <32, 32-33 and 34-36 weeks' postmenstrual age for the preterm infants, and at term-equivalent for both groups. Children were assessed at 4.5-5 years' corrected age using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd edition (MABC-2), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Little Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (Little DCD-Q) and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV (WPPSI-IV). RESULTS: Prior to term, abnormal GMA at the first two timepoints were associated with lower scores on the Little DCD-Q, and abnormal GMA at the second and third timepoints with lower quality of life scores and PEDI-CAT mobility domain scores. Abnormal GMA at term-equivalent were associated with lower MABC-2, mobility and quality of life scores for preterm infants, and worse social/cognitive domain scores for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal GMA prior to term and at term-equivalent are associated with worse motor, functional and cognitive outcomes at 4.5-5 years' corrected age, and may be useful to identify infants for developmental surveillance/early intervention.

AB  - Many genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are associated with multiple, sometimes seemingly unrelated, traits. This motivates multi-trait association analyses, which have successfully identified novel associated loci for many complex diseases. While appealing, most existing methods focus on analyzing a relatively small number of traits, and may yield inflated Type 1 error rates when a large number of traits need to be analyzed jointly. As deep phenotyping data are becoming rapidly available, we develop a novel method, referred to as aMAT (adaptive multi-trait association test), for multi-trait analysis of any number of traits. We applied aMAT to GWAS summary statistics for a set of 58 volumetric imaging derived phenotypes from the UK Biobank. aMAT had a genomic inflation factor of 1.04, indicating the Type 1 error rate was well controlled. More important, aMAT identified 24 distinct risk loci, 13 of which were ignored by standard GWAS. In comparison, the competing methods either had a suspicious genomic inflation factor or identified much fewer risk loci. Finally, four additional sets of traits have been analyzed and provided similar conclusions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing increased cognitive stimulation or learning opportunities to young children significantly increases cognitive and social-emotional competence later in life. This study aims to determine the acceptability of a pediatric assessment tool to track early child development (ECD) in a rural health district in Limpopo, South Africa. METHODS: A total of 11 primary health nurses from the region in two focus groups were selected to learn and compare two ECD assessment tools: the Cognitive Adaptive Test/Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale (CAT/CLAMS) and Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Data were analyzed using versus coding to compare between the two focus groups and between ASQ and CAT/CLAMS. RESULTS: The major categories that emerged from the discussion were current practice, usability, resource management, cultural adaptation, patient and parent factors, and new knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the challenges related to adapting and implementing ECD assessment in an environment where ECD is largely unknown by local residents, and differs from the environment in which the tool was initially developed. Further work is needed to develop new tools or alter existing tools that can be adapted to diverse settings and cultures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood brain tumors experience persistent health concerns across their lifespan. In the current study, the authors evaluated changes in symptom burden over the course of 12 months using pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. METHODS: Data from 202 survivors aged 8 to 21 years and 262 parents of survivors who were aged 5 to 21 years were analyzed. All completed a PROMIS Cognition short form and computerized adaptive tests of pediatric Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity Function, and Peer Relationships. Approximately one-half of participants (223 participants: 97 survivors of childhood brain tumors and 126 parents) completed the 12-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated group-level symptoms over time. Cox proportional hazard models explored whether symptoms predicted survival, and latent class growth analysis investigated patterns of individual-level symptom changes over time. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that patient-reported Cognition and parent-reported Anxiety worsened over time. Latent class growth analysis results indicated that patient and parent reports diverged, both with regard to the number of classes identified and in the trends of these classes. Parents and patients reported similar patterns of depression over time. For the other areas, parents either were more likely to observe different patterns (Peer Relationships and Mobility) or less likely to observe different patterns (Upper Extremity Function, Cognition, Anxiety, and Fatigue). Baseline patient-reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were found to be associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood brain tumors demonstrated different trajectory patterns of symptom burden. Along with baseline functioning status and days since treatment, patient-reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were associated with survival, suggesting a possible role for patient-reported outcomes in clinical care, especially individualized, tailored assessments such as PROMIS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Objective (SES) and subjective socioeconomic status (SSS) affect symptom intensity and magnitude of limitations. Identification of potentially modifiable social risk factors might contribute to additional opportunities for optimizing musculoskeletal health. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) There are no correlations between magnitude of limitations (as measured with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function [PROMIS PF computer adaptive test]) and components of SES or SSS in people with musculoskeletal disease; (2) There are no factors (including level of social deprivation) independently associated with PROMIS PF. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients presenting to clinicians specializing in the treatment of a broad variety of musculoskeletal conditions were prospectively enrolled in the study. We recorded patient demographics and assessed patients' socioeconomic status using the MacArthur Sociodemographic questionnaire and physical disability rating using PROMIS PF. Patients deprivation index was retrieved using their 9-digit ZIP codes. We used bivariate analysis to determine correlations between magnitude of limitations and socioeconomic status. We created a stepwise backward multivariable linear regression model to assess factors independently associated with PROMIS PF. RESULTS: Weak correlations were found on bivariate analysis of PROMIS PF with SSS measured as "Place in community" (r 0.28; P < 0.001) and "Place in the United States of America" (r 0.25; P = 0.002). In the multivariable models, the area deprivation index was not independently associated with physical limitations. Male gender (beta regression coefficient [beta] 4.1; 95% CI 0.71 to 7.5; P = 0.018) and having net worth of $5000 - $19,999 (beta 6.3; 95% CI 0.35 to 12; P = 0.038) or $20,000 - $99,999 (beta 5.8; 95% CI 2.1 to 9.5; P = 0.003) when compared to having net worth of less than $4999 were independently associated with better physical function. Being unemployed or disabled and keeping house, being a student, or retired were independently associated with worse physical function (beta -12; 95% CI -18 to -7.0; P < 0.001; beta -5.6; 95% CI -9.9 to -1.4; P = 0.009, respectively), when compared to working full-time or part-time. CONCLUSIONS: Objective and subjective measures of socioeconomic status are associated with magnitude of physical limitations in patients with musculoskeletal illness. These factors should be considered when developing treatment plans for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II prognostic study.

AB  - Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures play an important role in clinical care. Currently, a broad-spectrum, validated PRO measure suitable for all dermatology patients, as part of clinical care, does not exist. Patient-reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMIS) measures track specific domain outcomes across all diseases. To assess the relevance and utility of a computer-adaptive health assessment consisting of three PROMIS domains in routine dermatologic care. This retrospective study evaluated a PROMIS health assessment, consisting of three computer-adaptive test domains (pain interference, anxiety, and depression), administered as part of routine clinical care in three dermatology clinics at an academic medical center. The primary objective was to identify clinically significant associations between high PROMIS domain scores (i.e., t score > 55) and dermatologic disease, as well as change in PROMIS domain scores in response to treatment. The majority of patients who initiated the assessment completed all domains (88.7%). In patients with atopic dermatitis, acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and psoriasis, high PROMIS scores correlated with clinically relevant outcomes, such as severe disease, unsuccessful treatment, uncontrolled disease, and the presence of a mental health condition. PROMIS Pain Interference, anxiety and depression identified patients with severe disease, unsuccessful treatment regimens, poorly-controlled disease, and/or mental health comorbidities for multiple skin conditions. Further utilization of PROMIS domains in routine clinical care will promote patient-centered care and improve quality of care.

AB  - Background: FCS significantly affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Legacy patient-reported outcome measures are often not sensitive to FCS's impact. NIH PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures may accurately capture HRQOL in FCS patients. This study assessed a broad range of PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures covering physical, mental, and social HRQOL to determine their suitability for the FCS population.Methods: Adult FCS patients in the United States (N = 25) were recruited to an online survey study and completed several PROMIS short forms and Neuro-QoL computer adaptive tests.Results: Scores were more than 0.5 standard deviations (SD) worse than the normative mean on 10 of 16 normed measures, and more than 0.75 SDs worse than the normative mean on two measures. Responses at the floor and ceiling were occasionally observed, marginal reliabilities were strong, and significant differences across performance status (ps < 0.05) provided preliminary support for construct validity. The measures correlated with each other strongly and as expected.Conclusion: Results support the ability of PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures to detect HRQOL impairment among patients with FCS. PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures captured the functional impact and symptom burden associated with FCS, and the broad range of symptom severity experienced by patients with FCS.

CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Questionnaires to detect emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) in Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH) should be short which potentially affects validity and reliability. Simulation studies have shown that Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) could overcome these weaknesses. We studied the applicability (using the measures participation rate, satisfaction, and efficiency) and the validity of CAT in routine PCH practice. METHODS: We analyzed data on 461 children aged 10-11 years (response 41%), who were assessed during routine well-child examinations by PCH professionals. Before the visit, parents completed the CAT and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Satisfaction was measured by parent- and PCH professional-report. Efficiency of the CAT procedure was measured as number of items needed to assess whether a child has serious problems or not. Its validity was assessed using the CBCL as the criterion. RESULTS: Parents and PCH professionals rated the CAT on average as good. The procedure required at average 16 items to assess whether a child has serious problems or not. Agreement of scores on the CAT scales with corresponding CBCL scales was high (range of Spearman correlations 0.59-0.72). Area Under Curves (AUC) were high (range: 0.95-0.97) for the Psycat total, externalizing, and hyperactivity scales using corresponding CBCL scale scores as criterion. For the Psycat internalizing scale the AUC was somewhat lower but still high (0.86). CONCLUSIONS: CAT is a valid procedure for the identification of emotional and behavioral problems in children aged 10-11 years. It may support the efficient and accurate identification of children with overall, and potentially also specific, emotional and behavioral problems in routine PCH.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to correlate the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing (CAT) domains with commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) preoperatively in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care orthopedic center for biceps and labral pathology. METHODS: Prospective data were collected on 175 patients scheduled to undergo isolated biceps tenodesis at a tertiary center. Enrollees completed legacy scores (Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey, Short Form 12, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] Assessment Form, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and Constant-Murley score) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (Upper Extremity [UE], Pain Interference [PIF], and Depression). In addition, patients were asked to provide an assessment of the strength, function, and pain of the affected shoulder using a custom visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire. Spearman rank correlations of the PROMIS CAT with legacy measures and the custom VAS were calculated. Floor and ceiling effects were assessed. RESULTS: The UE CAT yielded moderate correlations with the ASES score (r = 0.57) and the custom VAS strength score (r = 0.50-0.57). The PIF CAT demonstrated moderate correlations with the VAS pain score (r = 0.45) and high-moderate correlations with the ASES score, VR6D score, and UE CAT (r = 0.61-0.66). The Depression CAT demonstrated high-moderate correlations with the mental health legacy measures (r = -0.64 to -0.61). There was a significant relative floor effect for the Depression CAT at a score of 34.2 (19%). CONCLUSION: The PIF CAT was comparable to the ASES score, the current gold standard. Compared with legacy measures, both the UE CAT and PIF CAT are less burdensome and have few floor or ceiling effects. The PIF CAT may be a viable alternative to describe the physical and psychosocial impact of pain in biceps tenodesis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression symptoms are prevalent in the general population, and as many as one in eight patients seeing a hand surgeon may have undiagnosed major depression. It is not clear to what degree lower mood is the consequence or cause of greater symptoms and limitations. If depressive symptoms are a consequence of functional limitations, they might be expected to improve when pathophysiology and impairment are ameliorated. Because surgical treatment is often disease-modifying or salvage, surgery might have a greater impact than nonoperative treatment, which is more often palliative (symptom relieving) than disease-modifying. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) For which hand or wrist conditions are depression symptoms lower after operative compared with nonoperative treatment? (2) Among the subset of patients with the highest depression scores, are depression symptoms lower after operative treatment compared with nonoperative treatment? (3) Among the subset of patients who had nonoperative treatment, are depression symptoms lower after a corticosteroid injection compared with no specific biomedical intervention? METHODS: At an academic orthopaedic department, 4452 patients had a new office visit for carpal tunnel syndrome, benign neoplasm, primary hand osteoarthritis, de Quervain's tendinopathy, or trigger digit. We analyzed the 1652 patients (37%) who had a return visit at least 3 months later for the same diagnosis. Patients completed the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression computerized adaptive test at every office visit (higher scores indicate more depression symptoms) and PROMIS Pain Interference (higher scores indicates greater hindrance in daily life owing to pain). Patients with a return visit were more likely to have surgical treatment and had greater Pain Interference scores at the first visit. Thirteen percent of patients (221 of 1652) had incomplete or missing scores at the initial visit and 33% (550 of 1652) had incomplete or missing scores at the final return visit. We used multiple imputations to account for missing or incomplete data (imputations = 50). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, we compared the mean change in Depression scores between patients treated operatively and those treated nonoperatively, accounting for PROMIS Pain Interference scores at the first visit, age, gender diagnosis, provider, and treatment duration. A post-hoc power analysis demonstrated that the smallest patient cohort (benign lump, n = 176) provided 99% power (alpha = 0.05) with eight predictor variables to detect a change of 2 points in the PROMIS Depression score (minimally important difference = 3.5). RESULTS: After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as pain interference and age, only carpal tunnel release was associated with a slightly greater decrease in depression symptoms compared with nonoperative treatment (regression coefficient [RC] = -3 [95% confidence interval -6 to -1]; p = 0.006). In patients with the highest PROMIS Depression scores for each diagnosis, operative treatment was not associated with an improvement in depression symptoms (carpal tunnel release: RC = 5 [95% CI -7 to 16]; p = 0.44). Moreover, a corticosteroid injection was not associated with fewer depression symptoms than no biomedical treatment (carpal tunnel release: RC = -3 [95% CI -8 to 3]; p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Given that operative treatment of hand pathology is not generally associated with a decrease in depression symptoms, our results support treating comorbid depression as a separate illness rather than as a secondary effect of pain or physical limitations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Biopsychosocial factors are associated with patient-reported upper extremity disability; however, their impact on postoperative outcomes remains less clear. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that high levels of preoperative patient-reported upper extremity and psychological disability are associated with lower magnitudes of improvement following trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction tendon interposition (LRTI). METHODS: Adult patients undergoing LRTI by fellowship-trained hand surgeons between February 2014 and March 2017 were considered for inclusion. Patient-reported outcomes were collected by tablet computer, including the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference (PI) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT), PROMIS Depression CAT, and PROMIS Anxiety CAT. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with QuickDASH improvement. RESULTS: Of 119 included patients, the mean age was 62.7 +/- 7.2 years and 74% were women. At a mean of 14 weeks after surgery, the QuickDASH improved by a mean of -10 +/- 20 points. The QuickDASH improvement was significantly greater for patients with preoperative QuickDASH scores greater than the median (score change, -19 +/- 20) versus those at or below the median (-2 +/- 16), and for patients with preoperative PI CAT scores greater than the median (-17 +/- 21) versus at or below the median (-4 +/- 17). No differences were observed between groups when Anxiety or Depression CAT baseline scores were similarly dichotomized. Multivariable modelling revealed that higher preoperative QuickDASH scores were associated with greater improvement on the QuickDASH; however, no association was observed for preoperative PI CAT, Depression CAT, and Anxiety CAT scores. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher levels of preoperative upper extremity disability experienced more improvement in the early postoperative period following LRTI. Baseline pain interference, depression, and anxiety were not associated with early outcomes. These findings may be useful when identifying patients who may experience the most functional improvement in the immediate postoperative period following LRTI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Outcome measures typically used to evaluate disease modifying therapies (DMTs) provide important information regarding their effects on disease activity, but they do not capture the full impact of living with multiple sclerosis (MS). Patient reported outcome measures (PROs) are increasingly being used to capture an individual's subjective experience of disease. We compared DMTs across a wide range of PRO outcomes in individuals with MS. METHODS: Subjects enrolled in SysteMS completed the computer adaptive testing version of the Neuro-QoL within four weeks of a clinical neurological exam. Neuro-QoL measures included the following 11 health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains: Ability to participate in Social Roles and Activities, Anxiety, Cognitive Function, Depression, Emotional and Behavioral Dyscontrol, Fatigue, Lower Extremity Function (mobility), Positive Affect and Wellbeing, Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities, Stigma, and Upper Extremity Function (fine motor). Treatments were grouped based on the three main modes of delivery: injectable, oral and infusion. The three treatment groups were compared using linear regression adjusting for two sets of covariates (set 1: age, sex, disease duration and EDSS; set 2: age, sex, disease duration, EDSS and treatment duration). We also compared the individual treatments using linear regression. RESULTS: After adjusting for the first set of clinical and demographic features of MS, there was a difference between treatment groups for Upper Extremity Function and Stigma. Subjects using injectable treatments reported better functioning in terms of Upper Extremity Function and Stigma than subjects using infusion treatments. In addition, subjects using injectable treatments reported better Upper Extremity Function than subjects treated with oral DMTs. When all individual treatments were compared, interferon-treated subjects reported significantly better functioning in terms of Stigma than natalizumab treated subjects. When further adjusting for time on treatment, the group differences were attenuated and no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We examined differences between MS treatment groups across a wide range of HRQOL outcomes. The results suggest that overall there are few differences between treatments on the physical, cognitive and emotional dimensions of well-being.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study is to understand how listeners with and without sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) use energy and temporal envelope cues to detect tones in noise. Previous studies of low-frequency tone-in-noise detection have shown that when energy cues are made less reliable using a roving-level paradigm, thresholds of listeners with normal hearing (NH) are only slightly increased. This result is consistent with studies demonstrating the importance of temporal envelope cues for masked detection. In contrast, roving-level detection thresholds are more elevated in listeners with SNHL at the test frequency, suggesting stronger weighting of energy cues. The present study extended these tests to a wide range of frequencies and stimulus levels. The authors hypothesized that individual listeners with SNHL use energy and temporal envelope cues differently for masked detection at different frequencies and levels, depending on the degree of hearing loss. DESIGN: Twelve listeners with mild to moderate SNHL and 12 NH listeners participated. Tone-in-noise detection thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in 1/3 octave bands of simultaneously gated Gaussian noise were obtained using a novel, two-part tracking paradigm. A track refers to the sequence of trials in an adaptive test procedure; the signal to noise ratio was the tracked variable. Each part of the track consisted of a two-alternative, two-interval, forced-choice procedure. The initial portion of the track estimated detection threshold using a fixed masker level. When the track continued, stimulus levels were randomly varied over a 20-dB rove range (+/-10 dB with respect to mean masker level), and a second threshold was estimated. Rove effect (RE) was defined as the difference between thresholds for the fixed- and roving-level tests. The size of the RE indicated how strongly a listener weighted energy-based cues for masked detection. Participants were tested at one to three masker levels per frequency, depending on audibility. RESULTS: Across all stimulus frequencies and levels, NH listeners had small REs ( approximately 1 dB), whereas listeners with SNHL typically had larger REs. Some listeners with SNHL had larger REs at higher frequencies, where pure-tone audiometric thresholds were typically elevated. RE did not vary significantly with masker level for either group. Increased RE for the SNHL group was consistent with simulations in which energy cues were more heavily weighted than envelope cues. CONCLUSIONS: Tone-in-noise detection thresholds in NH listeners were typically elevated only slightly by the roving-level paradigm at any frequency or level tested, consistent with the primary use of level-independent cues, such as temporal envelope cues that are conveyed by fluctuations in neural responses. In comparison, thresholds of listeners with SNHL were more affected by the roving-level paradigm, suggesting stronger weighting of energy cues. For listeners with SNHL, the largest RE was observed at 4000 Hz, for which pure-tone audiometric thresholds were most elevated. Specifically, RE size at 4000 Hz was significantly correlated with higher pure-tone audiometric thresholds at the same frequency, after controlling for the effect of age. Future studies will explore strategies for restoring or enhancing neural fluctuation cues that may lead to improved hearing in noise for listeners with SNHL.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prospectively study the clinical and developmental profile; hematological profile and the B-12 status using multiple parameters in children with Infantile tremor syndrome (ITS). METHODS: In this observational study (NCT02762682) (July 2015 through December 2016) children (and their mothers) with a clinical diagnosis of ITS were evaluated clinically; and development was assessed by CAPUTE scales. A complete blood count (CBC); peripheral blood smear examination; markers of vitamin B12 status (serum B12, homocysteine, folate); acylcarnitines [using Tandem mass spectrometry (TMS)] and urine methylmalonic acid (MMA) [Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS)] were estimated. A control group of children and their mothers were sampled for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 286 individuals were enrolled for this study. One-hundred-ten children with ITS were screened and 92 (20 with tremors; age 12.7 +/- 5 mo, 61 boys) children and their mothers were enrolled. Fifty-one children and their mothers were enrolled as controls. The median clinical linguistic & auditory milestone-developmental quotient (CLAM-DQ) was 32 (IQR 20.6-45.5) and median cognitive adaptive test-developmental quotient (CAT-DQ) was 36.2 (IQR 18.7-49.0). All babies except 9 (ovo-veg) had vegetarian mothers. Head circumference below 2 SD (WHO standards) was seen in 84% and below 3 SD in 58%. The CBC findings were; Hb- 8.3 +/- 1.6 g/dl, Thrombocytopenia-29 (32%), mean corpuscular volume (MCV)- 92.2 +/- 13.4, MCV- more than 95 fL-38(42%), Red cell distribution width (RDW)- 21.6 +/- 6.5, and macrocytes on peripheral smear in 68%. In 89 (97%) out of 92 children had laboratory features of deficient B12 status. Two-thirds of the mothers also had evidence of B12 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: ITS is, in all likelihood is a consequence of vitamin B12 defeciency. It has a significant impact on head growth and development of affected infants.

AB  - AIMS: Patient engagement in adaptive health behaviours and interactions with their healthcare ecosystem can be measured using self-reported instruments, such as the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) and the Effective Consumer Scale (ECS-17). Few studies have investigated the influence of patient engagement on limitations (patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs). First, we assessed whether patient engagement (PAM-13, ECS-17) within two to four weeks of an upper limb fracture was associated with limitations (the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Upper Extremity Physical Function computer adaptive test (PROMIS UE PF) scores) measured six to nine months after fracture, accounting for demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors. Secondly, we assessed the association between patient engagement and experience (numerical rating scale for satisfaction with care (NRS-C) and satisfaction with services (NRS-S) six to nine months after fracture. METHODS: A total of 744 adults with an isolated fracture of the proximal humerus, elbow, or distal radius completed PROMs. Due to multicollinearity of patient engagement and psychosocial variables, we generated a single variable combining measures of engagement and psychosocial factors using factor analysis. We then performed multivariable analysis with p < 0.10 on bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Patient engagement and psychosocial factors combined to form a single factor (factor 1) accounting for 20% (QuickDASH, semi-partial R(2) = 0.20) and 14% (PROMIS UE PF, semi-partial R(2) = 0.14) of the variation in limitations six to nine months after fracture. Factor 1 also accounted for 17% (NRS-C, semi-partial R(2) = 0.17) of variation in satisfaction with care, and 21% (NRS-S, semi-partial R(2) = 0.21) of variation in satisfaction with services. Demographic factors (age, sex, work status) and measures of greater pathophysiology (type of fracture, high-energy injury, post-surgical complications), accounted for much less variation. CONCLUSION: Patients who actively manage their health and demonstrate effective emotional and social functioning share a common underlying trait. They have fewer limitations and greater satisfaction with care during recovery from upper limb fractures. Future efforts should focus on evaluating initiatives that optimize patient engagement, such as patient education, coaching, and a communication strategy for healthcare professionals.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish preoperative validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function computer adaptive test (PROMIS PF-CT) with legacy patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for meniscal root tears (MRTs). Our study included 51 patients (52 knees) with MRT. Patients completed PROMIS PF-CT, Short Form 36 (SF-36 physical function, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional well-being, role limitations due to physical health, and role limitations due to emotional problems), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS pain, symptoms, activities of daily living [ADLs], sports, and quality of life [QOL]), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC pain, stiffness, and function), EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), and Knee Activity Scale questionnaires at their preoperative visit. Correlations between the PROMs listed above were evaluated along with floor and ceiling effects. Correlations were defined as weak (0.2-0.39), moderate (0.4-0.59), strong (0.6-0.79), and very strong (0.8-1.0). Preoperative data showed that PROMIS PF-CT has a strong correlation with SF-36 PF, KOOS-ADL, WOMAC-function, and EQ-5D; and moderate correlation with KOOS-sport, KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-QOL, WOMAC-pain, and WOMAC-stiffness. The Knee Activity Scale did not show any significant correlation with PROMIS PF-CT (r = 0.12, p = 0.2080). Of all the PROMs administered, PROMIS PF-CT demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects compared with 11.54% ceiling effect in KOOS-sports, and 5.77% floor effect in KOOS-ADL. On average, patients answered fewer PROMIS PF-CT questions (4.15 +/- 0.72). PROMIS PF-CT is a valuable tool to assess preoperative patient-reported physical function in patients that may undergo MRT repair. It correlates strongly with other well-established PROMs. It also demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects and demonstrated a low test burden in our sample of 52 knees. This is a level III, prognostic retrospective comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. METHOD: Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. RESULTS: We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. CONCLUSION: This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intolerance of uncertainty-the tendency to overestimate the chance of and be unwilling to accept potential, but unlikely, negative outcomes in uncertain situations-is a cognitive construct that has been shown to affect symptoms and limitations for patients with traumatic and nontraumatic upper-extremity conditions. Cognitive flexibility and tolerance of uncertainty can be trained and practiced, with the potential to increase musculoskeletal health. However, to our knowledge, the degree to which intolerance of uncertainty might be associated with symptom intensity and the magnitude of limitations in adults with upper-extremity problems has not been characterized. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: After accounting for personal and social factors, is intolerance of uncertainty independently associated with (1) the magnitude of physical limitations and (2) pain intensity? METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational study, 139 new and returning patients presenting to one of four orthopaedic offices in a large urban area completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (a validated measure of the level of comfort with uncertain situations), the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Physical Function Upper Extremity computer adaptive test (to measure the magnitude of limitations), and an 11-point ordinal measure of pain intensity. The mean age of the 139 participants was 51 years +/- 16 years and 55% (76 of 139) were men. Participants presented to the clinics with a wide variety of upper-extremity conditions, such as trigger finger, distal radius fractures, lateral epicondylitis, or non-specific shoulder pain. We also assessed sex, race, marital status, education level, income, public versus private insurance, area deprivation index, and the participant's self-perception of their healthcare experience through a multiple-choice question (answer choices: none, some, a little, and a lot of experience). The following patient characteristics were more common in our study participants: white, employed, part of a married or unmarried couple, and private insurance coverage. We created two multivariable linear regression models to assess factors independently associated with the magnitude of limitations and pain intensity. RESULTS: After controlling for potentially confounding variables including sex, insurance, area deprivation index, and type of visit, we found that fewer physical limitations were associated with a greater intolerance of uncertainty (regression coefficient [beta] -0.30; 95% confidence interval, -0.50 to -0.10; p = 0.003; semi-partial r = 0.07; adjusted r for the full model = 0.16), as was being a man (beta 3.2; 95% CI, 0.08-6.3; p = 0.045; semi-partial r = 0.03) and having private insurance coverage (beta 5.2; 95% CI, 2.1-8.2; p = 0.001; semi-partial r = 0.08). After controlling for one important potentially confounding variable, the level of education, greater pain intensity was associated with a greater intolerance of uncertainty (beta 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.14; p = 0.009; semi-partial r = 0.05; adjusted r for the full model = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Intolerance of uncertainty-a byproduct of cognitive bias and error, which are elements of the normal functioning of the human mind-increases limitations and pain intensity across diagnoses, independent of demographic and social factors. Future studies can address the effect of strategies that incorporate mindset training (for example, cognitive behavioral therapy and its derivatives) on musculoskeletal symptoms and limitations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - Glaucoma, an irreversible blinding condition affecting 3-4% adults aged above 40 years worldwide, is set to increase with a rapidly aging global population. Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma where the treatment paradigm is focused on managing IOP using medications, laser, or surgery regimens. However, notwithstanding IOP and other clinical parameters, patient-reported outcomes, including daily functioning, emotional well-being, symptoms, mobility, and social life, remain the foremost concerns for people being treated for glaucoma. These outcomes are measured using objective patient-centered outcome measures (PCOMs) and subjective patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Studies using PCOMs have shown that people with glaucoma have several mobility, navigational and coordination challenges; reading and face recognition deficits; and are slower in adapting to multiple real-world situations when compared to healthy controls. Similarly, studies have consistently demonstrated, using PROMs, that glaucoma substantially and negatively impacts on peoples' self-reported visual functioning, mobility, independence, emotional well-being, self-image, and confidence in healthcare, compared to healthy individuals, particularly in those with late-stage disease undergoing a heavy treatment regimen. The patient-centred effectiveness of current glaucoma treatment paradigms is equivocal due to a lack of well-designed randomized controlled trials; short post-treatment follow-up periods; an inappropriate selection or availability of PROMs; and/or an insensitivity of currently available PROMs to monitor changes especially in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage glaucoma. We provide a comprehensive, albeit non-systematic, critique of the psychometric properties, limitations, and recent advances of currently available glaucoma-specific PCOMs and PROMs. Finally, we propose that item banking and computerized adaptive testing methods can address the multiple limitations of paper-pencil PROMs; customize their administration; and have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for people with glaucoma.

TI  - Responsiveness of PROMIS(R) to change in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
JO  - Journal of patient-reported outcomes
VL  - 3

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive chronic disease characterized by airflow obstruction that leads to shortness of breath and substantial negative impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQL). The course of COPD includes periodic acute exacerbations that require changes in treatment and/or hospitalizations. This study was designed to examine the responsiveness of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System(R) (PROMIS(R)) measures to changes associated with COPD exacerbation recovery. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis using mixed-effects models was conducted of people who were enrolled while stable (n = 100) and those who experienced an acute exacerbation (n = 85). PROMIS (physical function, pain interference, pain behavior, fatigue, anxiety, depression, anger, social roles, discretionary social activities, Global Health, dyspnea severity and dyspnea functional limitations) and COPD-targeted HRQL measures were completed at baseline and at 12 weeks. RESULTS: We administered PROMIS measures using computer adaptive testing (CAT), followed by administration of any remaining short form (SF) items that had not yet been administered by CAT. Examination of the difference between group differences from baseline to 12 weeks in the stable and exacerbation groups revealed that the exacerbation group changed (improved) significantly more than the stable group in anxiety (p < .001 to p < .01; f(2) effect size [ES] = 0.023/0.021), fatigue (p < .0001; ES = 0.036/0.047) and social roles (p < .001 to p < .05; ES = 0.035/0.024). All effect sizes were small in magnitude and smaller than hypothesized. Depression was also statistically significant (p < .05, SF only) but the ES was trivial. For all other PROMIS domains, the differences were not significant and ES were trivial. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study provides some support for the validity of the PROMIS fatigue, anxiety, and social roles domains in COPD, but further evaluation of responsiveness is warranted.

AB  - There is limited validated data regarding the relationship between preoperative expectations and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients undergoing knee surgery. The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the preoperative expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery and (2) determine the relationship between preoperative patient demographics, PROs, and preoperative patient expectations. We hypothesized that younger patients with worse function and worse general health status would have greater expectations of knee surgery. We analyzed data from 399 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic medical center. We utilized the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System to measure preoperative expectations. Multiple legacy PRO measures were recorded, as well as the new Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) Computer Adaptive Testing. Nonparametric statistical analyses were performed to determine significance. Overall, patients undergoing knee surgery had high expectations, with a mean of 88.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 86.7-89.3) and median of 91.7 (95% CI, 89.2-94.3). Greater preoperative expectations of knee surgery were associated with higher income, surgically naive knee, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, better PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores, greater Marx knee activity scores, and lower total body pain (p < 0.05). Preoperative expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery are associated with a history of prior knee surgery, income, general and mental health, activity, and pain. Expectations were also found to be associated with PRO measures of function and psychological well-being. These findings may have implications for patient education and shared decision-making preoperatively. The level of evidence for the study is IV.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of 8 pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) item banks in a clinical sample of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: A total of 154 Dutch children (mean +/- SD age 14.4 +/- 3.0 years; range 8-18 years) with JIA completed 8 pediatric version 1.0 PROMIS item banks (anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, pain interference, peer relationships, physical function mobility, physical function upper extremity) twice and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ) once. Structural validity of the item banks was assessed by fitting a graded response model (GRM) and inspecting GRM fit (comparative fit index [CFI], Tucker-Lewis index [TLI], and root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]) and item fit (S-X(2) statistic). Convergent validity (with PedsQL/C-HAQ subdomains) and discriminative validity (active/inactive disease) were assessed. Reliability of the item banks, short forms, and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was expressed as the SE of theta (SE[theta]). Test-retest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and smallest detectable change. RESULTS: All item banks had sufficient overall GRM fit (CFI >0.95, TLI >0.95, RMSEA <0.08) and no item misfit (all S-X(2) P > 0.001). High correlations (>0.70) were found between most PROMIS T scores and hypothesized PedsQL/C-HAQ (sub)domains. Mobility, pain interference, and upper extremity item banks were able to discriminate between patients with active and inactive disease. Regarding reliability, PROMIS item banks outperformed legacy instruments. Post hoc CAT simulations outperformed short forms. Test-retest reliability was strong (ICC >0.70) for all full-length item banks and short forms, except for the peer relationships item bank. CONCLUSION: The pediatric PROMIS item banks displayed sufficient psychometric properties for Dutch children with JIA. PROMIS item banks are ready for use in clinical research and practice for children with JIA.

AB  - Purpose: We are developing item banks assessing the impact of retinal and vitreoretinal diseases (excluding age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment, covered elsewhere) on quality of life (QoL) for adults. This study outlines the first two phases of the multi-stage process: content development and item evaluation.Methods: We grouped retinal and vitreoretinal diseases into hereditary and acquired. Development of the item banks involved two phases: item identification and item evaluation. The items were extracted from three sources: (1) 17 pre-existing PRO instruments, (2) 4 qualitative studies and (3) 79 semi-structured interviews. Item evaluation involved three stages namely, binning (grouping) and winnowing (reduction), expert panel opinion and cognitive interviews.Results: The item identification phase yielded 1,217 items. After three sessions of binning and winnowing, items were reduced to a minimally representative set (n = 411) across nine QoL domains namely, activity limitation, emotional, social, health concerns, symptoms, economic, mobility, convenience, and coping. The hereditary group had a total of 345 items and the acquired group had a total of 257 items. After 23 cognitive interviews items were amended for hereditary diseases resulting in a final set of 345 items and 3 items were amended for acquired diseases, resulting in a final set of 254 items. Overall across nine domains 189 items were common to hereditary and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.Conclusion: As most of the items were unique to hereditary versus acquired retinal and vitreoretinal disease groups separate item banks are required to capture the QoL impacts for hereditary and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcome Measures and Patient Activation: What Are Their Roles in Orthopedic Trauma?
JO  - Journal of orthopaedic trauma
VL  - 33 Suppl 7
PY  - 2019
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - The rise of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement across medicine has been swift and now extends to the world of orthopedic trauma. However, PRO measures (PROMs) applied to trauma patients pose special considerations; measuring "episodes of care" is less straightforward, injuries are heterogeneous in their severity, and the patient's initial visit is "postinjury." Obtaining baseline scores and assessing the impact of a traumatic event on mental health are key considerations. Currently, few, if any, trauma registries include PROs; though general and condition-specific PROMs plus the patient empowerment measure of Patient Activation represent meaningful inputs for the clinical decision-making process. To be useful in trauma care, PROMs should be psychometrically sound and validated, be used for capturing function, screen for mental state and substance use, and give the clinician a sense of the patient's "activation" (engagement in their own health). Although the implementation of routine PRO collection can seem daunting, clinicians can use a multitude of electronic resources to access validated measures and simplify the implementation process. Computer-adaptive testing has evolved to help minimize patient burden, and PROM collection must maximize efficiency. Once established as part of your practice, PROs become an important tool to track recovery, identify mental health issues, engage in the prevention of future injury, and enable care of the whole patient.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Liver transplantation candidates are among the most comorbid patients awaiting lifesaving intervention. Health related quality of life (HRQOL) measured by instruments that incorporate dynamic computerized adaptive testing, could improve their assessment. We aimed to determine the feasibility of administration of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-CAT) in liver transplant candidates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver transplantation candidates were prospectively enrolled following a review of their available medical history. Subjects were given a tablet computer (iPad) to access the pre-loaded PROMIS CAT. RESULTS: 109 candidates with mean age 55.6+/-8.6 years were enrolled in this pilot study. Mean MELD-Na score was 16.3+/-6.3; 92.6% had decompensated liver disease. Leading etiologies of cirrhosis included hepatitis C (34.8%), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (25.7%) and alcohol (21.1%). Subjects with MELD-Na score>20 had the most significant impairment in HRQOL (anxiety/fear+5.9+/-2.7, p=0.0289, depression+5.1+/-2.5, p=0.0428, fatigue+4.3+/-2.6, p=0.0973) and physical impairment (-7.8+/-2.5, p=0.0022). Stage of cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease were predictive of impaired HRQOL but Child-Pugh Turcotte score was not. Hepatic encephalopathy was the strongest independent predictor of impaired HRQOL, with significant impairment across all domains of health. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant candidates have significantly impaired HRQOL across multiple domains of health as measured by PROMIS-CAT. HRQOL impairment parallels disease severity. Future study is needed to determine how best HRQOL could be systematically included in liver transplantation listing policy, especially in those candidates with hepatic encephalopathy.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To (1) confirm validity of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function and pain interference computer-adaptive tests (CATs) and (2) assess the validity of PROMIS Global Health (GH) and five additional PROMIS CATs: social role satisfaction, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance in a population of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) who completed a 3-month Interdisciplinary Pain Program (IPP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent recommendations for assessing outcomes in patients with cLBP have included PROMIS scales; however, there is a need for further evaluation, and PROMIS GH has not been studied in this population. METHODS: The study cohort included patients with cLBP who completed the entirety of a 3-month IPP between August 2016 and December 2018. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were analyzed before the start of the IPP and at graduation. Convergent and discriminant validity were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Known groups' validity assessed the change in PROMIS scores stratified by improvement on the Modified LBP Disability Questionnaire. Responsiveness was evaluated with standardized response means based on global impression of change. RESULTS: IPP was completed by 217 patients (67.7% women, age 53.8 +/- 12.8). Convergent validity was supported (P < 0.01 for all pairwise PROMs comparisons). All PROMs improved significantly by graduation, with the largest improvement for PROMIS pain interference, physical function, social role satisfaction, and Modified LBP Disability Questionnaire. Known groups' validity demonstrated the greatest change on PROMIS physical function, social role satisfaction, pain interference, and depression. Responsiveness was supported for all PROMs in 170 (78.3%) patients who indicated at least minimal improvement (standardized response means 0.43-1.06). CONCLUSION: Our study provides support of PROMIS CATs, highlights the importance of including other meaningful outcome measures, such as social role satisfaction, and provides the first validation of PROMIS GH, in patients with cLBP. PROMs collection can be streamlined through the use of PROMIS CATs which offer advantages over legacy measures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

AB  - PURPOSE: To test the null hypothesis that baseline opioid use is not associated with functional or psychological impairment among new hand surgery clinic patients, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments. METHODS: New adult (>/= 18 years) patient visits to a tertiary academic orthopedic nonshoulder hand and upper extremity clinic between February 2014 and April 2018 were eligible. Collected outcomes include the question, "Are you currently taking narcotic pain medications?", the PROMIS Upper Extremity (UE) computerized adaptive testing (CAT), abbreviated version of the Disorders of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH), PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT, PROMIS Pain Interference (PI) CAT, PROMIS Depression CAT, and PROMIS Anxiety CAT. Patients responding to the opioid question, plus the UE CAT or QuickDASH, were included. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression modelling were used to assess factors associated with baseline scores. RESULTS: Of 5997 included patients, 1,046 (17.4%) reported baseline opioid use. Patients in the opioid group demonstrated significantly worse scores on all patient-reported outcomes, and a significantly greater proportion of patients with PROMIS Depression CAT scores exceeding 60 (associated with a clinical diagnosis of depression; 29.5% vs 15.5%). Lower functional scores were observed in the opioid group after controlling for age, sex, other activity-limiting comorbidities, and either depression (UE CAT -7.0; QuickDASH +18.1; and PF CAT -6.6 points), anxiety (UE CAT -6.3; QuickDASH +16.4; PF CAT -6.3), or PI (UE CAT -3.7; QuickDASH +9.5; and PF CAT -4.2 points). Pain interference was greater among opiate users when controlling for age, sex, other activity-limiting comorbidities, and baseline function or psychological status: PI was 2.5, 5.0, or 4.3 points greater when controlling for the PROMIS UE CAT, Depression CAT, or Anxiety CAT. CONCLUSIONS: New patients presenting to a hand surgery clinic who endorse use of opioid medications at baseline report significantly decreased physical function, increased psychological burden, and greater levels of pain interference than nonusers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncology practice can be enhanced by the integration of the assessment of patient-reported symptoms and concerns into the electronic health record (EHR) and clinical workflows. METHODS: Adult oncology outpatients (n = 6825) received 38,422 invitations to complete assessments through the EHR patient portal. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests were administered to assess fatigue, pain interference, physical function, depression, and anxiety. Checklists identified psychosocial, nutritional, and informational needs. In real time, assessment results were populated in the EHR, and clinicians were notified of elevated symptoms and needs. RESULTS: In all, 3521 patients (51.6%) completed 8162 assessments; approximately 55% of the responding patients completed 2 or more within 32 months. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression scores were comparable to those of the general population (approximately 5% of assessments triggered clinical alerts across those domains); mean scores indicated a lower level of physical function (with severe scores prompting alerts in nearly 5% of assessments). More than half of assessments triggered an alert based on patient endorsement of supportive care needs, with the majority of those being nutritional (41.82% of assessments). Patient endorsement of supportive care needs was associated with significantly higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain interference scores and lower physical function scores. Patients who triggered clinical alerts tended to be younger and more recently diagnosed, to have greater comorbidities, and to be a racial/ethnic minority. Patients who triggered clinical alerts had more health care service encounters in the ensuing month. CONCLUSIONS: EHR integration facilitated the assessment and reporting of patient-reported symptoms and needs within routine oncology outpatient care.

AB  - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are a measure of health care quality that reflect the patient's perceptions of their own health status. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in implementation of PROs into everyday clinical practice. There are many dozens of PROs available to foot and ankle surgeons with little consensus on which measures are most appropriate for a given condition. These measures vary widely in length, validity, and content. When integrating PROs into clinical practice, we recommend that clinicians should collect, at a minimum, validated PRO scores that assess pain, function, and general health. Furthermore, concise instruments should be used wherever possible to minimize patient burden, maximize patient engagement, and ensure meaningful data are collected. In the near future, outcomes registries employing computer adaptive testing will facilitate the routine collection of PRO data from all patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, expert opinion.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent literature on the adaptive assessment of complex mental health disorders and provide a detailed comparison of classical test theory and adaptive testing based on multidimensional item response theory. RECENT FINDINGS: Adaptive tests for a wide variety of mental health traits (e.g., depression, anxiety, mania, substance misuse, suicidality) are now available in a cloud-based environment. These tests have been validated in a variety of settings against lengthy structured clinical interviews with excellent results and even higher reliability than fixed-length tests. Applications include screening and assessments in emergency departments, psychiatric and primary care clinics, student health clinics, perinatal medicine clinics, child welfare settings, and the judicial system. The future of mental health measurement will be based on automated screening and assessments. Adaptive tests will provide increased precision of measurement and decreased burden of measurement.

TI  - Jet fuel exposure and auditory outcomes in Australian air force personnel.
JO  - BMC public health
VL  - 19
PY  - 2019
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal data suggest that jet fuels such as JP-8 are associated with hearing deficits when combined with noise and that the effect is more pronounced than with noise exposure alone. Some studies suggest peripheral dysfunction while others suggest central auditory dysfunction. Human data are limited in this regard. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible chronic adverse effects of JP-8 combined with noise exposure on the peripheral and central auditory systems in humans. METHODS: Fifty-seven participants who were current personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were selected. Based on their levels of exposure to jet fuels, participants were divided into three exposure groups (low, moderate, high). Groups were also categorised based on their noise exposure levels (low, moderate, high). All participants were evaluated by tympanometry, pure-tone audiometry (1-12 kHz), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), words-in-noise, compressed speech, dichotic digit test, pitch pattern sequence test, duration pattern sequence test and adaptive test of temporal resolution. All auditory tests were carried out after the participants were away from the Air Force base for a minimum of two weeks, thus two weeks without jet fuel and noise exposure. RESULTS: Jet fuel exposure was significantly associated with hearing thresholds at 4 and 8 kHz; average hearing thresholds across frequencies in the better ear; DPOAEs at 2.8, 4 and 6 kHz; ABR wave V latency in the right ear; compressed speech and words-in-noise. Further analyses revealed that participants with low exposure level to jet fuels showed significantly better results for the aforementioned procedures than participants with moderate and high exposure levels. All results were controlled for the covariates of age and noise exposure levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that jet fuel exposure, when combined with noise exposure, has an adverse effect on audibility in humans. Taking all the test results into consideration, jet fuel exposure combined with noise exposure specifically seems to affect the peripheral hearing system in humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex interrelationship among physical health, mental health, and social health has gained the attention of the medical community in recent years. Poor social health, also called social deprivation, has been linked to more disease and a more-negative impact from disease across a wide variety of health conditions. However, it remains unknown how social deprivation is related to physical and mental health in patients presenting for orthopaedic care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do patients living in zip codes with higher social deprivation report lower levels of physical function and higher levels of pain interference, depression, and anxiety as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) at initial presentation to an orthopaedic provider than those from less deprived areas; and if so, is this relationship independent of other potentially confounding factors such as age, sex, and race? (2) Does the relationship between the level of social deprivation of a patient's community and that patient's physical function, pain interference, depression, and anxiety, as measured by PROMIS remain consistent across all orthopaedic subspecialties? (3) Are there differences in the proportion of individuals from areas of high and low levels of social deprivation seen by the various orthopaedic subspecialties at one large, tertiary orthopaedic referral center? METHODS: This cross-sectional evaluation analyzed 7500 new adult patients presenting to an orthopaedic center between August 1, 2016 and December 15, 2016. Patients completed PROMIS Physical Function-v1.2, Pain Interference-v1.1, Depression-v1.0, and Anxiety-v1.0 Computer Adaptive Tests. The Area Deprivation Index, a composite measure of community-level social deprivation, based on multiple census metrics such as income, education level, and housing type for a given nine-digit zip code was used to estimate individual social deprivation. Statistical analysis determined the effect of disparate area deprivation (based on most- and least-deprived national quartiles) for the entire sample as well as for patients categorized by the orthopaedic subspecialty providing care. Comparisons of PROMIS scores among these groups were based on an MCID of 5 points for each PROMIS domain (Effect size 0.5). RESULTS: Patients living in zip codes with the highest levels of social deprivation had worse mean scores across all four PROMIS domains when compared with those living in the least-deprived quartile (physical function 38 +/- 9 versus 43 +/- 9, mean difference 4, 95% CI, 3.7-5.0; p < 0.001; pain interference 64 +/- 8 versus 60+/-8, mean difference -4, 95% CI, -4.8 to -3.7; p < 0.001; depression 50+/-11 versus 45+/-8, mean difference -5, 95% CI, -6.0 to -4.5; p < 0.001; anxiety 56+/-11 versus 50 +/-10, mean difference -6, 95% CI, -6.9 to -5.4; p < 0.001). There were no differences in physical function, pain interference, depression, or anxiety PROMIS scores between patients from the most- and least-deprived quartiles who presented to the subspecialties of spine (physical function, mean 35+/-7 versus 35+/-7; p = 0.872; pain interference, 67+/-7 versus 66+/-7; p = 0.562; depression, 54+/-12 versus 51 +/-10; p = 0.085; and anxiety, 60+/-11 versus 58 +/-9; p = 0.163), oncology (physical function, mean 33+/-9 versus 38 +/-13; p = 0.105; pain interference, 68+/-9 versus 64+/-10; p = 0.144; depression, 51+/-10 versus 52+/-13; p = 0.832; anxiety, 59+/-11 versus 59+/-10 p = 0.947); and trauma (physical function, 35+/-11 versus 32+/-10; p = 0.268; pain interference, 66+/-7 versus 67+/-6; p = 0.566; depression, 52+/-12 versus 53+/-11; p = 0.637; and anxiety, 59+/-12 versus 60+/-9 versus; p = 0.800). The social deprivation-based differences in all PROMIS domains remained for the subspecialties of foot/ankle, where mean differences ranged from 3 to 6 points on the PROMIS domains (p < 0.001 for all four domains), joint reconstruction where mean differences ranged from 4 to 7 points on the PROMIS domains (p < 0.001 for all four domains), sports medicine where mean differences in PROMIS scores ranged from 3 to 5 between quartiles (p < 0.001 for all four domains), and finally upper extremity where mean differences in PROMIS scores between the most- and least-deprived quartiles were five points for each PROMIS domain (p < 0.001 for all four domains). The proportion of individuals from the most- and least-deprived quartiles was distinct when looking across all seven subspecialty categories; only 11% of patients presenting to sports medicine providers and 17% of patients presenting to upper extremity providers were from the most-deprived quartile, while 39% of trauma patients were from the most-deprived quartile (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic patients must be considered within the context of their social environment because it influences patient-reported physical and mental health as well as has potential implications for treatment and prognosis. Social deprivation may need to be considered when using patient-reported outcomes to judge the value of care delivered between practices or across specialties. Further studies should examine potential interventions to improve the perceived health of patients residing in communities with greater social deprivation and to determine how social health influences ultimate orthopaedic treatment outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A large body of research shows that psychologic distress and ineffective coping strategies substantially contribute to more severe pain and increased physical limitations among patients with orthopaedic disorders. However, little is known about the relationship between positive psychology (constructs that enable individuals to thrive and adapt to challenges) and pain and physical limitations in this population. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which positive-psychology factors (satisfaction with life, gratitude, coping through humor, resilience, mindfulness, and optimism) are independently associated with fewer upper-extremity physical limitations after controlling for the other clinical and demographic variables? (2) Which positive-psychology factors are independently associated with pain intensity after controlling for relevant clinical and demographic variables? METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we recruited patients presenting for a scheduled appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon at a hand and upper-extremity clinic of a major urban academic medical center. Of 125 approached patients, 119 (44% men; mean age, 50 +/- 17 years) met screening criteria and agreed to participate. Patients completed a clinical and demographic questionnaire, the Numerical Rating Scale to assess pain intensity, the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Physical Function computerized adaptive test to assess physical limitations, and six measures assessing positive-psychology constructs: The Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Gratitude Questionnaire, the Coping Humor Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised, and the Life Orientation Test-Revised. We first examined bivariate associations among physical limitations, pain intensity, and all positive-psychology factors as well as demographic and clinical variables. All variables that demonstrated associations with physical limitations or pain intensity at p < 0.05 were included in two-stage multivariable hierarchical regression models. RESULTS: After controlling for the potentially confounding effects of prior surgical treatment and duration since pain onset (step1; R total = 0.306; F[7,103] = 6.50), the positive-psychology variables together explained an additional 15% (R change = 0.145, F change [5, 103] = 4.297, p = 0.001) of the variance in physical limitations. Among the positive-psychology variables tested, mindfulness was the only one associated with fewer physical limitations (beta = 0.228, t = 2.293, p = 0.024, 4% variance explained). No confounding demographic or clinical variables were found for pain intensity in bivariate analyses. All positive-psychology variables together explained 23% of the variance in pain intensity (R = 0.23; F[5,106] = 6.38, p < 0.001). Among the positive-psychology variables, satisfaction with life was the sole factor independently associated with higher intensity (beta = -0.237, t = -2.16, p = 0.033, 3% variance explained). CONCLUSIONS: Positive-psychology variables explained 15% of the variance in physical limitations and for 23% of the variance in pain intensity among patients with heterogenous upper extremity disorders within a hand and upper extremity practice. Of all positive-psychology factors, mindfulness and satisfaction with life were most important for physical limitations and pain intensity, respectively. As positive-psychology factors are more easily modifiable through skills-based interventions than pain and physical limitations, results suggest implementation of such interventions to potentially improve outcomes in this population. Skills-based interventions targeting mindfulness and satisfaction with life may be of particular benefit. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - Genetic variants associated with disease outcomes can be used to develop personalized treatment. To reach this precision medicine goal, hundreds of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in the past decade to search for promising genetic variants associated with various traits. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However, in total these identified variants explain only part of the variation for most complex traits. There remain many genetic variants with small effect sizes to be discovered, which calls for the development of (a) GWAS with more samples and more comprehensively genotyped variants, for example, the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is planning to conduct whole genome sequencing on over 100 000 individuals; and (b) novel and more powerful statistical analysis methods. The current dominating GWAS analysis approach is the "single trait" association test, despite the fact that many GWAS are conducted in deeply phenotyped cohorts including many correlated and well-characterized outcomes, which can help improve the power to detect novel variants if properly analyzed, as suggested by increasing evidence that pleiotropy, where a genetic variant affects multiple traits, is the norm in genome-phenome associations. We aim to develop pleiotropy informed powerful association test methods across multiple traits for GWAS. Since it is generally very hard to access individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data for those existing GWAS, due to privacy concerns and various logistical considerations, we develop rigorous statistical methods for pleiotropy informed adaptive multitrait association test methods that need only summary association statistics publicly available from most GWAS. We first develop a pleiotropy test, which has powerful performance for truly pleiotropic variants but is sensitive to the pleiotropy assumption. We then develop a pleiotropy informed adaptive test that has robust and powerful performance under various genetic models. We develop accurate and efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-value for the proposed adaptive test without the need of resampling or permutation. We illustrate the performance of proposed methods through application to joint association test of GWAS meta-analysis summary data for several glycemic traits. Our proposed adaptive test identified several novel loci missed by individual trait based GWAS meta-analysis. All the proposed methods are implemented in a publicly available R package.

AB  - Genome-wide sequencing enables evaluation of associations between traits and combinations of variants in genes and pathways. But such evaluation requires multi-locus association tests with good power, regardless of the variant and trait characteristics. And since analyzing families may yield more power than analyzing unrelated individuals, we need multi-locus tests applicable to both related and unrelated individuals. Here we describe such tests, and we introduce SKAT-X, a new test statistic that uses genome-wide data obtained from related or unrelated subjects to optimize power for the specific data at hand. Simulations show that: a) SKAT-X performs well regardless of variant and trait characteristics; and b) for binary traits, analyzing affected relatives brings more power than analyzing unrelated individuals, consistent with previous findings for single-locus tests. We illustrate the methods by application to rare unclassified missense variants in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA2, as applied to combined data from prostate cancer families and unrelated prostate cancer cases and controls in the Multi-ethnic Cohort (MEC). The methods can be implemented using open-source code for public use as the R-package GATARS (Genetic Association Tests for Arbitrarily Related Subjects) <https://gailg.github.io/gatars/>.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) Network has developed a comprehensive repository of electronic patient reported outcomes measures (ePROs) of major symptom domains that have been validated in cancer patients. Their use for patients with gynecologic cancer has been understudied. Our objective was to establish feasibility and acceptability of PROMIS ePRO integration in a gynecologic oncology outpatient clinic and assess if it can help identify severely symptomatic patients and increase referral to supportive services. METHODS: English-speaking patients with a confirmed history of gynecologic cancer completed PROMIS ePROs on iPads in the waiting area of an outpatient gynecologic oncology clinic. Symptom scores were calculated for each respondent and grouped using documented severity thresholds. Response data was compared with clinicopathologic characteristics across symptom domains. Severely symptomatic patients were offered referral to ancillary services and asked to complete post-exposure surveys assessing acceptability of the ePRO. RESULTS: Of the 336 patients who completed ePROs, 35% had active disease and 19% had experienced at least one disease recurrence. Sixty-nine percent of the cohort demonstrated moderate to severe physical dysfunction (60%), pain (36%), fatigue (28%), anxiety (9%), depression (8%), and sexual dysfunction (32%). Thirty-nine (12%) severely symptomatic patients were referred to services such as psychiatry, palliative care, pain management, social work or integrative oncology care. Most survey respondents identified the ePROs as helpful (78%) and easy to complete (92%). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient PROMIS ePRO administration is feasible and acceptable to gynecologic oncology patients and can help identify severely symptomatic patients for referral to ancillary support services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Legacy hip outcome measures may be burdensome to patients and sometimes yield floor or ceiling effects. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) allow for low-burden data capture and limited ceiling and floor effects. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PROMIS CAT domains demonstrate correlation against commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The authors hypothesized the following: (1) PROMIS CAT scores based on physical function (PF), pain interference (PIF), pain behavior, and pain intensity would show strong correlation with the following legacy scores: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12), Hip Outcome Score (HOS) Sports and Activities of Daily Living subscales, and Veterans RAND-6D (VR-6D) utility measure. (2) The mental and physical health portions of the VR-6D legacy measure would show weak correlation with mental- and psychosocial-specific PROMIS elements-depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. (3) All PROMIS measures would exhibit fewer floor and ceiling effects than legacy scores. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Prospective data were collected on 125 patients in the hip preservation clinics. Enrollees completed legacy scores (visual analog scale for pain, mHHS, iHOT-12, HOS, and VR-6D) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (PF, PIF, pain behavior, anxiety, depression, sleep, social roles and activities, pain intensity, fatigue). Spearman rank correlations were calculated, with r(s) values of 0 to 0.3 indicating negligible correlation; 0.3 to 0.5, weak correlation; 0.5 to 0.7, moderately strong correlation; and >0.7, strong correlation. Floor and ceiling effects were evaluated. RESULTS: As anticipated, the PF-CAT yielded strong correlations with the iHOT-12, mHHS, HOS-Sports, HOS-Activities of Daily Living, and VR-6D, with r(s) values of 0.76, 0.71, 0.81, 0.87, and 0.71, respectively. The PIF-CAT was the only pain score to show moderately strong to strong correlation with all 14 patient-reported outcome measures. A strong correlation was observed between the VR-6D and the social roles and activities CAT ( r(s) = 0.73). The depression CAT had a significant floor effect at 19%. No additional floor or ceiling effect was present for any other legacy or PROMIS measure. CONCLUSION: The PF-CAT shows strong correlation with legacy patient-reported outcome scores among patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The PIF-CAT also correlates strongly with legacy and PROMIS measures evaluating physical and mental well-being. PROMIS measures are less burdensome and demonstrate no floor or ceiling effects, making them a potential alternative to legacy patient-reported outcome measures for the hip.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computer-adaptive tests (CAT) use individualised sets of questions to assess patient-reported health states, whereas static (conventional) questionnaires present the same questions to all patients. CAT has been shown to increase measurement precision and reduce assessment length. In our study, we investigated if patients perceive CAT questions as more appropriate than static questionnaires, a claim that is frequently associated with CAT measures. METHODS: We compared the static European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) against its corresponding CAT measures focusing on two domains: Physical Functioning (PF) and Emotional Functioning (EF). Cancer patients completed the questionnaires and participated in a cognitive interview to assess how appropriate they perceive the QLQ-C30 and the CAT questions for their current health state. RESULTS: Forty-four cancer patients (mean age = 54.6; 56.8% female) were assessed. For the PF domain, patients considered the CAT items more appropriate (p = 0.002) than the QLQ-C30 items (56.8% vs. 15.9%; 27.2% indifferent). For the EF domain, patients were in favour of the QLQ-C30 items (p < 0.001), with 54.5% considering the QLQ-C30, and 4.5% considering the CAT items to be more appropriate; 40.9% were indifferent. Most patients (N = 36) commented on the preference for the CAT (PF), mentioning better matching of the questions and the health state (38.6%) and better item wording (15.9%). CONCLUSION: For the PF domain the CAT measure better matched the score distribution in the patient sample than the QLQ-C30 PF scale and was consequently considered more appropriate by patients. For the EF domain, the CAT measure did not show better fit than the QLQ-C30 and hence no such preference in terms of appropriateness was observed.

AB  - PURPOSE: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for depression in the general adult population. Although screening questionnaires for depression and anxiety exist in primary care settings, electronic health tools such as computerized adaptive tests based on item response theory can advance screening practices. This study evaluated the validity of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) for screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) and assessing MDD and anxiety severity among adult primary care patients. METHODS: We approached 402 English-speaking adults for participation from a primary care clinic, of whom 271 adults (71% female, 65% black) participated. Participants completed modules from the CAT-MH (Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD, CAT-Depression Inventory, CAT-Anxiety Inventory); brief paper questionnaires (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]); and a reference-standard interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) Diagnoses. RESULTS: On the basis of the interview, 31 participants met criteria for MDD and 29 met criteria for GAD. The diagnostic accuracy of the Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD (area under curve [AUC] = 0.85) was similar to that of the PHQ-9 (AUC = 0.84) and higher than that of the PHQ-2 (AUC = 0.76) for MDD screening. Using the interview as the reference standard, the accuracy of the CAT-Anxiety Inventory (AUC = 0.93) was similar to that of the GAD-7 (AUC = 0.97) for assessing anxiety severity. The patient-preferred screening method was assessment via tablet/computer with audio. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized adaptive testing could be a valid and efficient patient-centered screening strategy for depression and anxiety screening in primary care settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the authors demonstrate to spine surgeons the prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression among patients presenting for surgery and explore the relationships between different legacy and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) screening measures. METHODS: A total of 512 adult spine surgery patients at a single institution completed the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7), 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression scale, and PROMIS Anxiety and Depression computer-adaptive tests (CATs) preoperatively. Correlation coefficients were calculated between PROMIS scores and GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores. Published reference tables were used to determine the presence of anxiety or depression using GAD-7 and PHQ-8. Sensitivity and specificity of published guidance on the PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were compared. Guidance from 3 sources was compared: published GAD-7 and PHQ-8 crosswalk tables, American Psychiatric Association scales, and expert clinical consensus. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine data-driven cut-points for PROMIS Anxiety and Depression. Significance was accepted as p < 0.05. RESULTS: In 512 spine surgery patients, anxiety and depression were prevalent preoperatively (55% with any anxiety, 24% with generalized anxiety screen-positive; and 54% with any depression, 24% with probable major depression). Correlations were moderately strong between PROMIS Anxiety and GAD-7 scores (r = 0.72; p < 0.001) and between PROMIS Depression and PHQ-8 scores (r = 0.74; p < 0.001). The observed correlation of the PROMIS Depression score was greater with the PHQ-8 cognitive/affective score (r = 0.766) than with the somatic score (r = 0.601) (p < 0.001). PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were able to detect the presence of generalized anxiety screen-positive (sensitivity, 86.0%; specificity, 81.6%) and of probable major depression (sensitivity, 82.3%; specificity, 81.4%). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated data-driven cut-points for these groups. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs are reliable tools for identifying generalized anxiety screen-positive spine surgery patients and those with probable major depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiatrists' unique training in person-centered biopsychosocial management of complex problems may influence musculoskeletal patients' expectations and self- and/or physician-referral patterns to physiatrists. Consequently, average patient complexity and need for multi-disciplinary services may be increased in physiatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare musculoskeletal patients' self-reported physical and emotional health according to provider specialty. Researchers tested the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores between patients who present to physiatrists in comparison to other musculoskeletal specialists. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Orthopedic department of a tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Participants included 31 791 new adult patients (mean age 52.6 +/- 16.2 years) who presented for initial elective evaluation of a musculoskeletal problem by an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine trained emergency medicine, family medicine, pediatric, or physiatric physician. METHODS: Patients completed the PROMIS computer adaptive test (CAT) Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression domains at department check-in prior to the physician encounter. Score differences by provider type were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Mean PROMIS score in each domain subdivided by physiatric, surgical, and other nonsurgical provider type. RESULTS: In total, 2081 patients presented to physiatrists, 28 267 presented to surgeons, and 1443 presented to other nonsurgical providers. For each respective provider type, average PROMIS scores were Physical Function 38.9 +/- 8.2, 41.5 +/- 9.5, and 43.5 +/- 8.2; Pain Interference 62.6 +/- 7.2, 60.9 +/- 7.7, and 59.2 +/- 6.8; Anxiety 54.5 +/- 10.4, 51.9 +/- 10.6, and 49.8 +/- 9.8; and Depression 49.3 +/- 10.4, 47.0 +/- 10.0, and 44.2 +/- 8.7. Physiatric patients had significantly worse average scores for all domains compared to surgical (P < .001) and other nonsurgical patients (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Average PROMIS Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression scores were worse in musculoskeletal patients who presented to physiatrists in comparison to surgical or other nonsurgical providers. This suggests that some patients who choose to see or are referred to see physiatrists may have more or be more willing to endorse having biopsychosocial impairments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: This study develops psychometrically valid item banks across 10 areas of quality of life (QoL) specific to people with hereditary retinal diseases, which will enable clinicians and researchers to explore the impact of hereditary retinal diseases across all aspects of QoL. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of hereditary retinal disease QoL item banks using Rasch analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system in obtaining precise measurement of QoL using only a few items. METHODS: The hereditary retinal disease item banks were answered by 233 participants (median age, 58 years; range, 18 to 94 years; female participants, 59%). The hereditary retinal disease item banks cover 10 QoL domains: activity limitation, mobility, emotional, social, convenience, economic, health concerns, visual symptoms, ocular comfort symptoms, and general symptoms. Rasch analysis assessed the psychometric properties of the 10 item banks and provided item calibrations for the development of CAT. Computerized adaptive testing simulations were performed to calculate the average number of items required to gain precise measurement of each QoL domain. RESULTS: The convenience, economic, visual symptoms, and the social domains formed unidimensional scales. However, the activity limitation and health concerns domains demonstrated multidimensionality and required major modifications to resolve this, which resulted in four new QoL domains, namely, reading, driving, lighting, and concerns about the disease progression. In total, 10 item banks underwent CAT simulation testing, which indicated that 8 to 12 items were required to gain precise measurement of each QoL domain. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed 10 psychometrically valid item banks to measure the QoL domains relevant to people with hereditary retinal diseases. On average, only 5 and 10 items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively.

TI  - Psychiatrists' Attitudes Toward Disruptive New Technologies: Mixed-Methods Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent discoveries in the fields of machine learning (ML), Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), digital phenotype, imaging, and biomarkers have brought about a new paradigm shift in medicine. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore psychiatrists' perspectives on this paradigm through the prism of new clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). Our primary objective was to assess the acceptability of these new technologies. Our secondary objective was to characterize the factors affecting their acceptability. METHODS: A sample of psychiatrists was recruited through a mailing list. Respondents completed a Web-based survey. A quantitative study with an original form of assessment involving the screenplay method was implemented involving 3 scenarios, each featuring 1 of the 3 support systems, namely, EMA and CAT, biosensors comprising a connected wristband-based digital phenotype, and an ML-based blood test or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated 4 acceptability domains based on International Organization for Standardization and Nielsen models (usefulness, usability, reliability, and risk). RESULTS: We recorded 515 observations. Regarding our primary objective, overall acceptability was moderate. MRI coupled with ML was considered to be the most useful system, and the connected wristband was considered the least. All the systems were described as risky (410/515, 79.6%). Regarding our secondary objective, acceptability was strongly influenced by socioepidemiological variables (professional culture), such as gender, age, and theoretical approach. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess psychiatrists' views on new CDSSs. Data revealed moderate acceptability, but our analysis shows that this is more the result of the lack of knowledge about these new technologies rather than a strong rejection. Furthermore, we found strong correspondences between acceptability profiles and professional culture profiles. Many medical, forensics, and ethical issues were raised, including therapeutic relationship, data security, data storage, and privacy risk. It is essential for psychiatrists to receive training and become involved in the development of new technologies.

TI  - The influence of mental health on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and traditional outcome instruments in patients with symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assessment includes computerized adaptive tests (CATs) that assess function, pain, depression, and anxiety. The influence of mental health on patients' self-reported pain and function has not been explored using PROMIS in patients with symptomatic glenohumeral osteoarthritis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 284 shoulders in 276 patients presenting with isolated glenohumeral osteoarthritis. All patients completed the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), and PROMIS CATs at the time of presentation. PROMIS anxiety and depression scores were converted into Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores, respectively, using the PROsetta Stone "crosswalk" tool. Mean pain and functional scores were compared between patients with and without PROMIS-converted scores corresponding to a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, as well as between scores corresponding to varying degrees of anxiety or depression. RESULTS: Patients with scores corresponding to a diagnosis of anxiety or depression reported lower functional and higher pain scores compared to those with scores in the normal range (P < .001). Analysis of variance showed progressively lower functional and higher pain scores as anxiety severity increased (P < .001). Similar results were seen with ASES, upper extremity CAT, and pain scores as depression severity increased (P < .001). Functional ASES (P = .004), SST (P < .001), and physical function CAT (P = .002) scores were statistically significantly lower in patients with moderate to severe depression than those without depression or with mild depression. DISCUSSION: In patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis, PROMIS-reported anxiety and depression scores, particularly in those with moderate-to-severe scores, correlate with lower functional and higher pain scores. Further investigation is necessary to examine the influence that mental health has on outcomes after operative intervention in this population.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data. RESULTS: Many existing GWAS summary data-based association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by individual trait-based association test. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All the proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely efficient: it takes less than 2 min to compute the list of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux desktop.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with brain tumors can experience symptom burden throughout their disease continuum. The aim of the study was to evaluate symptom burden reported by children with brain tumors and factors that potentially were associated with their symptoms. METHODS: Data from 199 children with brain tumors aged 7-22 (mean age = 14 years; 52% males; 76% white) were analyzed. Symptom burden was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) via computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-anxiety, depression, fatigue, mobility, upper extremity function, peer relationship, and cognition. Patients and parents completed Symptom Distress Scales (SDS). Test statistics and ANOVA were used to evaluate relationships between PROMIS measures and potentially influential variables. RESULTS: Significant results (P < 0.01) showing impact of symptom burden included: PROMIS measures correlated with SDSs reported by patients and parents on all comparisons. Fatigue, mobility, and upper extremity function were associated with Karnofsky functional performance status, number of treatment modalities (0-3), and time since last treatment (</=1 year, >1 year). Fatigue and cognition were associated with educational program (regular classroom without an individualized education plan vs those that had an individualized education plan); mobility and upper extremity function were associated with time since last radiation. Mobility, upper extremity function, and anxiety were associated with time since last chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations were found between PROMIS and SDS as well as clinical and demographic characteristics. Brief-yet-precise PROMIS CATs can be used to systematically assess symptom burden experienced by children with brain tumors.

CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most important aspects of designing a clinical trial is selecting appropriate outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can provide a personal assessment of the burden and impact of a malignant disease and its treatment. PROs comprise a wide range of outcomes including basic clinical symptom scores and complex metrics such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There is limited data on how postoperative complications following cancer surgery affect symptoms and HRQoL. For this reason the primary aim of the PATRONUS study is to investigate how perioperative complications affect cancer-related symptoms and HRQoL in patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery. The PATRONUS study is designed and will be initiated and conducted by medical students under the direct supervision of clinician scientists based on the concept of inquiry-based learning. METHODS: PATRONUS is a non-interventional prospective multicentre cohort study. Patients undergoing elective oncological abdominal surgery will be recruited at regional centres of the clinical network of the German Surgical Society (CHIR-Net) and associated hospitals. A core set of 12 cancer associated symptoms will be assessed via the PRO version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The cancer-specific HRQoL will be measured via the computerised adaptive testing version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. PROs will be measured eight times over a period of six months. The short-term clinical outcome measure is the rate of postoperative complications (grade II to V) within 30 days according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The long-term clinical outcome is overall survival within six months postoperative. DISCUSSION: PATRONUS will provide essential insights into the patients' assessment of their well-being and quality of life in direct relation to clinical outcome parameters following abdominal cancer surgery. Furthermore, PATRONUS will investigate the feasibility of multicentre student-led clinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Auditory processing (AP) is commonly regarded as the perceptual processing of auditory information in the central nervous system. However, the degree to which higher level cognitive processes are involved in AP or its disorders is contentious. Furthermore, there is little evidence regarding the effects of nonauditory cognitive processes on the various tests of AP in common clinical usage and thus on clinical diagnoses of auditory processing disorder. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of increased cognitive demand, generated by using a dual-task paradigm, on performance on different AP tests and types of AP tests in common clinical usage. In addition, to investigate the relationship between executive function and changes in AP test performance associated with increased cognitive demand. RESEARCH DESIGN: Counterbalanced repeated measures design, with assessment of AP test performance both on its own and in a dual-task paradigm designed to increase cognitive demand. STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-nine young adults, with no reported hearing, learning, language or attention difficulties, English as first language, and hearing and middle-ear status within normal limits. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Testing was completed within a single 90-min session. A selection of standard AP tests, representing both adaptive and nonadaptive tests, as well as tests employing difference scores, was administered. These were Competing Sentences Test, Dichotic Digits Test, Frequency Pattern Test (nonadaptive tests); and Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences test, conditions "same-voice, 0 degrees ", "different-voice, 0 degrees ", and "same-voice, 90 degrees " (adaptive tests), from which the difference scores "talker advantage" and "spatial advantage" were also derived. Each AP test was completed on its own (alone condition), and simultaneously with a visually presented task (dual-task condition). Executive function was assessed using the phonemic subtest of the Verbal Fluency Test. Nonparametric statistical test procedures were used. RESULTS: All five AP measures obtained from the nonadaptive tests showed a significant performance decrement in the dual-task condition compared with the alone condition, with one exception because of a strong ceiling effect. By contrast, none of the three AP measures obtained from the adaptive tests showed a significant performance decrement in the dual-task condition. Furthermore, neither of the two AP measures based on difference scores showed a significant performance decrement, but this finding simply reflects the lack of significant decrements in the relevant raw scores. Consistent with past reports of associations between executive function and AP performance, a significant positive correlation was found between executive function scores and performance on the Dichotic Digits Test. However, there were no significant correlations between executive function scores and changes in AP test scores between alone and dual-task conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Performance on commonly used nonadaptive tests of AP was significantly compromised by the increased cognitive demand resulting from the dual-task paradigm. By contrast, performance on AP measures obtained by adaptive test procedures was not significantly affected. Further investigation of the resilience to increased cognitive demand of the adaptive tests used here, and other adaptive tests of AP, is warranted. Results from this study support the further development of computerized adaptive tests of AP for use in clinical test batteries.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Many GWAS conducted in the past decade have identified tens of thousands of disease related variants, which in total explained only part of the heritability for most traits. There remain many more genetics variants with small effect sizes to be discovered. This has motivated the development of sequencing studies with larger sample sizes and increased resolution of genotyped variants, e.g., the ongoing NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) whole genome sequencing project. An alternative approach is the development of novel and more powerful statistical methods. The current dominating approach in the field of GWAS analysis is the "single trait single variant" association test, despite the fact that most GWAS are conducted in deeply-phenotyped cohorts with many correlated traits measured. In this paper, we aim to develop rigorous methods that integrate multiple correlated traits and multiple variants to improve the power to detect novel variants. In recognition of the difficulty of accessing raw genotype and phenotype data due to privacy and logistic concerns, we develop methods that are applicable to publicly available GWAS summary data. RESULTS: We build rigorous statistical models for GWAS summary statistics to motivate novel multi-trait SNP-set association tests, including variance component test, burden test and their adaptive test, and develop efficient numerical algorithms to quickly compute their analytical P-values. We implement the proposed methods in an open source R package. We conduct thorough simulation studies to verify the proposed methods rigorously control type I errors at the genome-wide significance level, and further demonstrate their utility via comprehensive analysis of GWAS summary data for multiple lipids traits and glycemic traits. We identified many novel loci that were not detected by the individual trait based GWAS analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We have implemented the proposed methods in an R package freely available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MSKAT.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Feeling Trapped item bank. RESULTS: From an initial item pool of 28 items, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the retention of 16 items. After graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning analyses were conducted, 15 items were retained in the final measure. GRM calibration data, along with clinical expert input, were used to choose a 6-item, static short form (SF), and the calibration data were used for programming of the TBI-CareQOL Feeling Trapped computer adaptive test (CAT). CAT simulation analyses produced an r=0.99 correlation between CAT scores and the full item bank. Three-week short-form test-retest reliability was very good (r=0.84). CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Feeling Trapped item bank was developed to provide a sensitive and efficient examination of the effect that feelings of being trapped, due to the caregiver role, have on health-related quality of life for caregivers of individuals with TBI. Both the CAT and corresponding 6-item SF demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. Future work is needed to establish the responsiveness of this measure to clinical interventions for these caregivers.

AB  - A cross-sectional analysis of data derived from patients undergoing knee surgery at a single institution was conducted. The objectives of the study were to determine the demographic, diagnostic, and psychologic factors associated with opioid use; and to determine the clinical correlates of opioid use. We hypothesized that preoperative opioid use would be associated with worse patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. The sample consisted of 383 patients undergoing knee surgery. The patients were classified as either opioid or nonopioid users on the basis of medical record review. All participants completed a battery of clinical assessments, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive testing in six domains: Physical Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Social Satisfaction, Anxiety, and Depression. Analyses were conducted to examine clinical variables as a function of opioid use. The results indicated that opioid use was associated with female gender, unemployment, smoking, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, greater number of previous surgeries, depression or anxiety, and worse expectation of surgery (p < 0.05). Multivariable analysis found opioid use to be a significant independent predictor of multiple PRO measures in patients undergoing knee surgery. Potential explanations for these findings are presented, and clinical implications are discussed.

DESIGN: Qualitative data, literature reviews, and cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of civilians (n=344) or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain Item Bank. RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, a graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning supported the retention of 33 items in the final measure. GRM calibration data was used to inform the selection of a 6-item static short form, and to program the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain computer-adaptive test (CAT). CAT simulation analyses indicated a 0.97 correlation between the CAT scores and the full item-bank. Three-week test-retest reliability was strong (r=0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain CAT and corresponding 6-item short form were developed using established rigorous measurement development standards; this is the first self-reported measure developed to evaluate caregiver strain in caregivers of individuals with TBI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop new patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to better understand feelings of loss in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of civilians with TBI (n=344) or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Feelings of Loss-Self and TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Person with Traumatic Brain Injury item banks. RESULTS: While the initial exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the feelings of loss item pool (98 items) potentially supported a unidimensional set of items, further analysis indicated 2 different factors: Feelings of Loss-Self (43 items) and Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI (20 items). For Feelings of Loss-Self, an additional 13 items were deleted due to item-response theory-based item misfit; the remaining 30 items had good overall model fit (comparative fit index [CFI]=0.96, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI]=.96, root mean squared error of approximation [RMSEA]=.10). For Feelings of Loss-Other, 1 additional item was deleted due to an associated high correlated error modification index value; the final 19 items evidenced good overall model fit (CFI=0.97, TLI=.97, RMSEA=.095). The final item banks were developed to be administered as either a Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) or a short-form (SF). Clinical experts approved the content of the 6-item SFs of the 2 measures (3-week test-retest was r=.87 for Feelings of Loss-Self and r=.85 for Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study resulted in the development of 2 new PROs to assess feelings of loss in caregivers of individuals with TBI; TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Self and TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI. Good psychometric properties were established and an SF was developed for ease of use in clinical situations. Additional research is needed to determine concurrent and predictive validity of these measures in the psychological treatment of those caring for persons with TBI.

JO  - The Journal of hand surgery
VL  - 44
PY  - 2019
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - PURPOSE: Social, mental, and physical health have a complex interrelationship with each influencing individuals' overall health experience. Social circumstances have been shown to influence symptom intensity and magnitude of disability for a variety of medical conditions. We tested the null hypothesis that social deprivation would not impact Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores or objective health factors in patients presenting for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 367 patients who presented for evaluation of CTS to 1 of 6 hand surgeons at a tertiary academic center between August 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. Patients completed PROMIS Physical Function-v1.2, Pain Interference-v1.1, Depression-v1.0, and Anxiety-v1.0 Computer Adaptive Tests. The Area Deprivation Index was used to quantify social deprivation. Medical record review determined duration of symptoms, tobacco and opioid use, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for each patient. Sample demographics, PROMIS scores, and objective health measures were compared in groups defined by national quartiles of social deprivation. RESULTS: Patients with CTS living in the most deprived quartile had worse mean scores across all 4 PROMIS domains compared with those living in the least deprived quartile. A higher proportion of individuals from the most deprived quartile had a heightened level of anxiety than those in the least deprived quartile (37.3% vs 12.6%). The mean CCI was higher in the most deprived quartile, as was the proportion of individuals using tobacco. There were no differences in opioid use or symptom duration between patients from each deprivation quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Social deprivation is associated with worse patient-reported health measures in patients with CTS. Compared with those from the least deprived areas, patients from the most deprived areas also have a greater comorbidity burden and higher rates of tobacco use at presentation to a hand surgeon.

VL  - 44

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - PURPOSE: Surgery for nontraumatic upper-extremity problems is largely discretionary and preference-sensitive. Psychological and social determinants of health correlate with greater symptoms and limitations and might be associated with discretionary operative treatment. METHODS: We used routinely collected patient-reported outcome measures from patients with de Quervain tendinopathy, ganglion cyst, trapeziometacarpal arthritis, trigger digit, and carpal tunnel syndrome to study factors associated with discretionary surgery using multiple logistic regression. Patients completed a measure of the magnitude of physical limitations (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Test [CAT]), a measure of the degree to which a person limits activities owing to pain (PROMIS Pain Interference CAT), and a measure of symptoms of depression (PROMIS Depression CAT) at every office visit. RESULTS: Higher PROMIS Pain Interference score, diagnoses of carpal tunnel syndrome, and treatment by teams 3, 4, or 5 were independently associated with discretionary operative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: People with a greater tendency to limit activity owing to pain are more likely to choose discretionary surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interventions that help people remain active despite pain by addressing the psychological and social determinants of health might affect the rate of discretionary surgery.

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether positively or negatively phrased Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) prior to a visit with the hand surgeon affect patient perceived empathy and patient satisfaction (Patient-Reported Experience Measures [PREMs]). METHODS: Between June 2017 and July 2017, we enrolled 134 patients who presented to 3 hand surgeons at 2 outpatient offices. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: completion of negatively framed questionnaires (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS-4], and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] depression Computer Adaptive Test [CAT]) or completion of positively framed questionnaires (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire [PSEQ-2]) prior to the visit. At the end of the visit, all patients completed questionnaires on patient-perceived physician empathy and patient satisfaction. Five patients were excluded from the analysis after randomization. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant differences between groups on patient-perceived physician empathy and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the content of psychological questionnaires completed prior to the visit does not affect patient satisfaction and perceived empathy recorded after the visit. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Given the degree to which PROMs are influenced by psychosocial factors, and prior evidence that PROMs are primed by negatively framed questionnaires, it is reassuring that negatively framed PROMs did not affect PREMs, but more research is merited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate recognition of mental health problems is a prerequisite for successful treatment. Although most people tend to consult their general practitioner (GP) when they first experience mental health problems, GPs are not very well equipped to screen for various forms of psychopathology to help them determine clients' need for treatment. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the development and characteristics of CATja, a computerized adaptive test battery built to facilitate triage in primary care settings, are described, and first results of its implementation are reported. METHODS: CATja was developed in close collaboration with GPs and mental health assistants (MHAs). During implementation, MHAs were requested to appraise clients' rankings (N=91) on the domains to be tested and to indicate the treatment level they deemed most appropriate for clients before test administration. We compared the agreement between domain score appraisals and domain score computed by CATja and the agreement between initial (before test administration) treatment level advice and final treatment level advice. RESULTS: Agreements (Cohen kappas) between MHAs' appraisals of clients' scores and clients' scores computed by CATja were mostly between .40 and .50 (Cohen kappas=.10-.20), and the agreement between "initial" treatment levels and the final treatment level advised was .65 (Cohen kappa=.55). CONCLUSIONS: Using CATja, caregivers can efficiently generate summaries of their clients' mental well-being on which decisions about treatment type and care level may be based. Further validation research is needed.

AB  - Background: Patient-reported outcome measures vary more than expected based on underlying pathology, in part due to the substantial influence of mood and coping strategies. Methods: This study addressed the primary null hypothesis that the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function score 1 month (range, 3-8 weeks) after hand surgery is not associated with PROMIS Depression and PROMIS Pain Interference scores prior to surgery, accounting for other factors. Using an institution-wide database of routinely collected patient-reported outcomes, we identified adult patients who underwent wrist ganglion excision, trapeziometacarpal arthroplasty, hand ganglion excision, trigger digit, De Quervain, and carpal tunnel release. Measures collected included the PROMIS Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT), PROMIS Pain Interference CAT, and PROMIS Depression CAT. We sought factors associated with postsurgical PROMIS Physical Function scores and change between preoperative and postoperative score using multivariable linear regression, accounting for age, sex, surgery type, provider, and time from surgery to postsurgical measurement. Results: Higher postoperative PROMIS Physical Function score was independently associated with lower PROMIS Pain Interference scores, lower PROMIS Depression scores, younger age, and treatment by provider team 3. Greater change in PROMIS Physical Function score was independently associated with greater PROMIS Pain Interference scores, greater time from surgery, and treatment by provider team 3. Conclusions: Mood and effective coping strategies affect the level of symptoms and limitations during recovery from hand surgery and represent important treatment opportunities for enhancing recovery.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our understanding of the coping strategies used by people with visual impairment to manage stress related to visual loss is limited. This study aims to develop a sophisticated coping instrument in the form of an item bank implemented via Computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for hereditary retinal diseases. METHODS: Items on coping were extracted from qualitative interviews with patients which were supplemented by items from a literature review. A systematic multi-stage process of item refinement was carried out followed by expert panel discussion and cognitive interviews. The final coping item bank had 30 items. Rasch analysis was used to assess the psychometric properties. A CAT simulation was carried out to estimate an average number of items required to gain precise measurement of hereditary retinal disease-related coping. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine participants answered the coping item bank (median age = 58 years). The coping scale demonstrated good precision and targeting. The standardised residual loadings for items revealed six items grouped together. Removal of the six items reduced the precision of the main coping scale and worsened the variance explained by the measure. Therefore, the six items were retained within the main scale. Our CAT simulation indicated that, on average, less than 10 items are required to gain a precise measurement of coping. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to develop a psychometrically robust coping instrument for hereditary retinal diseases. CAT simulation indicated that on an average, only four and nine items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). METHODS: All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. RESULTS: The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170â€¯+/-â€¯67â€¯s (averageâ€¯+/-â€¯Stdev) to answer 25â€¯+/-â€¯6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R(2) values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R(2) values of 0.5236. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop the first item bank to measure stress resilience (SR) in clinical populations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative item development resulted in an initial pool of 131 items covering a broad theoretical SR concept. These items were tested in n = 521 patients at a psychosomatic outpatient clinic. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, as well as other state-of-the-art item analyses and item response theory were used for item evaluation and calibration of the final item bank. RESULTS: Of the initial item pool of 131 items, we excluded 64 items (54 factor loading <0.5, four residual correlations >0.3, two nondiscriminative item response curves, and four differential item functioning). The final set of 67 items indicated sufficient model fit in confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory analyses. In addition, a 10-item short form with high measurement precision (SE </= 0.32 in a theta range between -1.8 and +1.5) was derived. Both the SR item bank and the SR short form were highly correlated with an existing static legacy tool (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale). CONCLUSION: The final SR item bank and 10-item short form showed good psychometric properties. When further validated, they will be ready to be used within a framework of computer-adaptive tests for a comprehensive assessment of the stress construct.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research documents that greater psychologic distress (anxiety/depression) and less effective coping strategies (catastrophic thinking, kinesophobia) are associated with greater pain intensity and greater limitations. Recognition and acknowledgment of verbal and nonverbal indicators of psychologic factors might raise opportunities for improved psychologic health. There is evidence that specific patient words and phrases indicate greater catastrophic thinking. This study tested proposed nonverbal indicators (such as flexion of the wrist during attempted finger flexion or extension of uninjured fingers as the stiff and painful finger is flexed) for their association with catastrophic thinking. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do patients with specific protective hand postures during physical examination have greater pain interference (limitation of activity in response to nociception), limitations, symptoms of depression, catastrophic thinking (protectiveness, preparation for the worst), and kinesophobia (fear of movement)? (2) Do greater numbers of protective hand postures correlate with worse scores on these measures? METHODS: Between October 2014 and September 2016, 156 adult patients with stiff or painful fingers within 2 months after sustaining a finger, hand, or wrist injury were invited to participate in this study. Six patients chose not to participate as a result of time constraints and one patient was excluded as a result of inconsistent scoring of a possible hand posture, leaving 149 patients for analysis. We asked all patients to complete a set of questionnaires and a sociodemographic survey. We used Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression, Upper Extremity Physical Function, and Pain Interference computer adaptive test (CAT) questionnaires. We used the Abbreviated Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4) to measure catastrophic thinking in response to nociception. Finally, we used the Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia (TSK) to assess fear of movement. The occurrence of protective hand postures during the physical examination was noted by both the physician and researcher. For uncertainty or disagreement, a video of the physical examination was recorded and a group decision was made. RESULTS: Patients with one or more protective hand postures did not score higher on the PROMIS Pain Interference CAT (hand posture: 59 [56-64]; no posture: 59 [54-63]; difference of medians: 0; p = 0.273), Physical Function CAT (32 +/- 8 versus 34 +/- 8; mean difference: 2 [confidence interval CI, -0.5 to 5]; p = 0.107), nor the Depression CAT (48 [41-55] versus 48 [42-53]; difference of medians: 0; p = 0.662). However, having at least one hand posture was associated with a higher degree of catastrophic thinking (PCS scores: 13 [6-26] versus 10 [3-16]; difference of medians: 3; p = 0.0104) and a higher level of kinesophobia (TSK: 40 +/- 6 versus 38 +/- 6; mean difference: -2 [CI, -4 to -1]; p = 0.0420). Greater catastrophic thinking was associated with a greater number of protective hand postures on average (rho: 0.20, p = 0.0138). CONCLUSIONS: Protective hand postures and (based on prior research) specific words and phrases are associated with catastrophic thinking and kinesophobia, less effective coping strategies that hinder recovery. Surgeons can learn to recognize these signs and begin to treat catastrophic thinking and kinesophobia starting with compassion, empathy, and patience and be prepared to add formal support (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy) to help facilitate recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study.

TI  - What Is the Relationship of Fear Avoidance to Physical Function and Pain Intensity in Injured Athletes?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear avoidance can play a prominent role in maladaptive responses to an injury. In injured athletes, such pain-related fear or fear avoidance behavior may have a substantial influence on the recovery process. Specifically, it may explain why some are able to reach their preinjury abilities, whereas others are unable to return to sport. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is fear avoidance in athletes associated with decreased physical function after injury? (2) To what degree is fear avoidance associated with athletes' pain intensity? METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we recruited injured athletes-defined as patients with sports-related injury, weekly engagement in sport activities, participation in competitive events as part of a team or club, self-identification as an athlete, and a desire to return to sport after recovery-from an orthopaedic sports medicine center at a major urban university hospital. Of 130 approached patients, 102 (84% men; mean +/- SD age 25 +/- 8.5 years) met the inclusion criteria. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Athlete Fear Avoidance Questionnaire, which assesses injury-related fear and avoidance behavior specifically in an athletic population, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and two Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures: Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) and Pain Intensity CAT. RESULTS: After controlling for age, injury region (upper versus lower extremity), catastrophic thinking, and emotional distress, we found that an increase in athletes' fear avoidance was associated with a decrease in physical function (b = -0.32; p = 0.002). The model explained 30% of the variation in physical function with 7.3% explained uniquely by fear avoidance. After controlling for initial appointment/followup, surgery for the current condition, multiple pain conditions, history of prior sport-related injury/surgery, pain medication prescription, catastrophic thinking, and emotional distress, athletes' fear avoidance was not associated with pain (b = -0.14; p = 0.249). The model explained 40% of the variation in pain intensity and pain catastrophizing (b = 0.30; p = 0.001) uniquely explained 7.1% of this variation. CONCLUSIONS: In injured athletes, fear avoidance is independently associated with decreased physical function, whereas pain catastrophizing is associated with high pain intensity. Both level of an athlete's fear avoidance and catastrophic thinking about pain should be accounted for in clinical interventions aimed at helping athletes improve recovery and return to sport. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, validity, and reliability of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Short Form (PROMIS10) in outpatients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: SLE outpatients completed PROMIS10, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), LupusQoL-US, and selected PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CAT) at routine visits at an SLE Center of Excellence. Construct validity was evaluated by correlating PROMIS10 physical and mental health scores with PROMIS CAT, legacy instruments, and physician-derived measures of disease activity and damage. Test-retest reliability was determined among subjects reporting stable SLE activity at 2 assessments 1 week apart using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: A diverse cohort of 204 out of 238 patients with SLE (86%) completed survey instruments. PROMIS10 physical health scores strongly correlated with physical function, pain, and social health domains in PROMIS CAT, SF-36, and LupusQoL, while mental health scores strongly correlated with PROMIS depression CAT, SF-36, and LupusQoL mental health domains (Spearman correlations >/= 0.70). Active arthritis, comorbid fibromyalgia (FM), and anxiety were associated with worse PROMIS10 scores, but sociodemographic factors and physician-assessed flare status were not. Test-retest reliability for PROMIS10 physical and mental health scores was high (ICC >/= 0.85). PROMIS10 required < 2 minutes to complete. CONCLUSION: PROMIS10 is valid and reliable, and can efficiently screen for impaired physical function, pain, and emotional distress in outpatients with SLE. With strong correlations to LupusQoL and SF-36 but significantly reduced responder burden, PROMIS10 is a promising tool for measuring patient-reported outcomes in routine SLE clinical care and value-based healthcare initiatives.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Models from signal detection theory are commonly used to score neuropsychological test data, especially tests of recognition memory. Here we show that certain item response theory models can be formulated as signal detection theory models, thus linking two complementary but distinct methodologies. We then use the approach to evaluate the validity (construct representation) of commonly used research measures, demonstrate the impact of conditional error on neuropsychological outcomes, and evaluate measurement bias. METHOD: Signal detection-item response theory (SD-IRT) models were fitted to recognition memory data for words, faces, and objects. The sample consisted of U.S. Infantry Marines and Navy Corpsmen participating in the Marine Resiliency Study. Data comprised item responses to the Penn Face Memory Test (PFMT; N = 1,338), Penn Word Memory Test (PWMT; N = 1,331), and Visual Object Learning Test (VOLT; N = 1,249), and self-report of past head injury with loss of consciousness. RESULTS: SD-IRT models adequately fitted recognition memory item data across all modalities. Error varied systematically with ability estimates, and distributions of residuals from the regression of memory discrimination onto self-report of past head injury were positively skewed towards regions of larger measurement error. Analyses of differential item functioning revealed little evidence of systematic bias by level of education. CONCLUSIONS: SD-IRT models benefit from the measurement rigor of item response theory-which permits the modeling of item difficulty and examinee ability-and from signal detection theory-which provides an interpretive framework encompassing the experimentally validated constructs of memory discrimination and response bias. We used this approach to validate the construct representation of commonly used research measures and to demonstrate how nonoptimized item parameters can lead to erroneous conclusions when interpreting neuropsychological test data. Future work might include the development of computerized adaptive tests and integration with mixture and random-effects models.

AB  - PURPOSE: Prior research regarding the impact of mental health on upper extremity musculoskeletal function and recovery has frequently grouped catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression. This study was designed to define the relative prevalence of heightened anxiety versus depressive symptoms among a patient population seeking upper extremity care and to determine if those prevalences varied according to the symptomatic condition. METHODS: All adult patients presenting to a tertiary upper extremity orthopedic center between June 1, 2016 and November 30, 2016 (n = 3,315) completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety and Depression Computer Adaptive Tests. Descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression assessed differences in average PROMIS scores between demographic and diagnostic groups. Patients were also analyzed according to crossing thresholds for heightened anxiety and depression scores based on established linkage tables with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Depression scales, respectively. Pearson chi-square analysis and binary logistic regression were performed to determine if the proportion of patients crossing these thresholds varied according to the primary symptomatic condition while accounting for patient age, sex, and race. RESULTS: African American patients and those with carpal tunnel syndrome, trapeziometacarpal arthritis, or shoulder conditions reported significantly higher PROMIS Anxiety scores. Higher PROMIS Depression scores varied only by diagnosis. Seventeen percent of patients exceeded the Anxiety symptoms score threshold and 10% of patients exceeded the Depression symptom threshold. In logistic regression modeling, the likelihood of exceeding the Anxiety threshold varied by diagnosis and was increased in African American patients and females. African American race was associated with exceeding the Depression threshold while accounting for sex and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with upper extremity conditions more frequently report heightened anxiety than heightened depression. Patient race and diagnosis are independent predictors of anxiety among patients seeking care for upper extremity conditions. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate functional outcomes and evaluate predictors of an unfavorable functional outcome in children following a critical illness. DESIGN: Prospective observational longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Two tertiary care, Canadian PICUs: McMaster Children's Hospital and London Health Sciences. PATIENTS: Children 12 months to 17 years old, admitted to PICU for at least 48 hours with one or more organ dysfunction, were eligible. Patients not expected to survive, direct transfers from neonatal ICU and patients in whom long-term follow-up would not be able to be conducted, were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was functional outcome up to 6 months post PICU discharge, measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disabilities Inventory Computer Adaptive Test. Secondary outcomes included predictors of unfavorable functional outcome, caregiver stress, health-related quality-of-life, and clinical outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, and PICU-acquired complications. One hundred eighty-two patients were enrolled; 78 children (43.6%) had functional limitations at baseline and 143 (81.5%) experienced functional deterioration following critical illness. Ninety-two (67.1%) demonstrated some functional recovery by 6 months. Higher baseline function and a neurologic insult at PICU admission were the most significant predictors of functional deterioration. Higher baseline function and increasing age were associated with slower functional recovery. Different factors affect the domains of functioning differently. Preexisting comorbidities and iatrogenic PICU-acquired morbidities were associated with persistent requirement for caregiver support (responsibility function) at 6 months. The degree of functional deterioration after critical illness was a significant predictor of increased hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new information regarding functional outcomes and the factors that influence meaningful aspects of functioning in critically ill children. Identifying patients at greatest risk and modifiable targets for improvement in PICU care guides us in developing strategies to improve functional outcomes and tailor to the rehabilitation needs of these patients and their families.

AB  - In this paper, we summarise and critique a network meta-analysis (NMA) of antidepressant efficacy and tolerability for paediatric depression and an accompanying editorial. Although we agree that many of the extant studies are flawed, this meta-analysis showed clear efficacy of fluoxetine in the NMA, and for sertraline and escitalopram in pairwise analyses. Consequently, these papers underestimate the benefits of antidepressants for paediatric depression, and provide support for current practice guideline, which recommends the use of an antidepressant if the patient does not respond to psychotherapy. In these circumstances, fluoxetine should be the first choice, with escitalopram and sertraline as alternatives.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer-adaptive testing (CAT) physical function and pain interference scores can detect early variations in postoperative outcomes following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and to determine whether age, sex, body mass index, mechanical symptoms, duration of symptoms, and the severity of chondrosis affect these scores. METHODS: Seventy-five patients who had undergone a partial meniscectomy between September 2015 and March 2016 and had both preoperative and postoperative PROMIS-CAT data for physical function, pain interference, and depression were included. Demographic, clinical, and surgical data including the presence of intraoperative chondral lesions were collected for statistical analysis to assess for factors that led to differences in PROMIS-CAT outcomes. RESULTS: Preoperatively, patients had decreased physical function and increased pain interference in excess of 1 standard deviation from the general population with mean PROMIS scores of 38.5 and 63.5, respectively. At the 6-week postoperative visit, patients had significant improvements in both physical function and pain interference with mean scores of 43.4 (P < .001, SE = 0.75) and 55.5 (P < .001, SE = 0.83). Female patients had less improvement in PROMIS physical function (P = .03) and depression (P = .02) scores postoperatively compared with male patients. Patients with high-grade articular cartilage lesions had less improvement in physical function (P = .014) and pain interference (P = .010) at 6 weeks postoperative compared with patients with low grade or no chondral lesion. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS-CAT provides responsive outcome measures to early postoperative changes in physical function and pain following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and has prognostic value in patient outcomes 6 weeks after procedure. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV case series.

AB  - During treatment of lymphedema, routine use of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) is recommended to monitor patient progress; however, the validity functional status (FS) PROMs in these patients is unknown. Our aims were to examine construct validity of the shoulder computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and the foot-and-ankle CAT, as a measure of FS for patients selecting the shoulder or the foot-and-ankle as their main body part affected by their lymphedema. We assessed the ability of the FS scores to distinguish between patient groups in clinically expected ways at admission and discharge from physical therapy. At admission (n=1600), patients who were younger and had more acute symptoms, less severe lymphedema, less co-morbidities, no relevant surgical history, did not use medications for chronic conditions, and exercised regularly, had higher FS. At discharge (n=611), patients who were younger and had less advanced lymphedema, fewer co-morbidities, no relevant surgical history, did not use medications for chronic conditions, exercised regularly, and had more acute symptoms had higher FS change, after controlling for their baseline FS score. Low participation rates in FS outcomes data collection could have biased results. Overall, the CAT-based FS PROMs used in this study discriminated between patient groups in clinically logical ways both at intake and at discharge from lymphedema treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) quality-of-life (QoL) item banks and determine the utility of the final calibrated item banks by simulating a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) application. METHODS: In this clinical, cross-sectional study, 514 participants with DR/DME (mean age +/- SD, 60.4 +/- 12.6 years; 64% male) answered 314 items grouped under nine QoL item pools: Visual Symptoms (SY); Ocular Comfort Symptoms (OS); Activity Limitation (AL); Mobility (MB); Emotional (EM); Health Concerns (HC); Social (SC); Convenience (CV); and Economic (EC). The psychometric properties of the item pools were assessed using Rasch analysis, and CAT simulations determined the average number of items administered at high and moderate precision levels. RESULTS: The SY, MB, EM, and HC item pools required minor amendments, mainly involving removal of six poorly worded, highly misfitting items. AL and CV required substantial modification to resolve multidimensionality, which resulted in two new item banks: Driving (DV) and Lighting (LT). Due to unresolvable psychometric issues, the OS, SC, and EC item pools were not pursued further. This iterative process resulted in eight operational item banks that underwent CAT simulations. Correlations between CAT and the full item banks were high (range, 0.88-0.99). On average, only 3.6 and 7.2 items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our eight psychometrically robust and efficient DR/DME item banks will enable researchers and clinicians to accurately assess the impact and effectiveness of treatment therapies for DR/DME in all areas of QoL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement instruments that are used for monitoring patients in mental health care are developed according to the principles of classical test theory. Because the assumptions underlying this theory are outdated, this is a good time to work towards a new method of measurement known as computerised adaptive testing (CAT), the method being based on item response theory. AIM: To introduce the CAT-methodology into Dutch mental health care, and provide an overview of the current and desirable developments. METHOD: We explain what CAT is and why mental health care should warmly welcome this new development. We also outline the limitations of CAT, summarise the developments that have already been made nationally and internationally and consider some developments we think are desirable. RESULTS: PROMIS item banks for anxiety and depression for adults show that CAT is more efficient than instruments currently in use and is able to produce very precise outcomes. CONCLUSION: The first CATs for anxiety and depression will be available late 2017 or early 2018 for adults receiving mental health care in the Netherlands. Recent results are very impressive and CAT-technology will increase the efficiency of symptom measurements, bringing these measurements to a higher level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization of patient-reported outcome tools allows a more accurate assessment of the efficacy of treatment, which is critical to comparative effectiveness research. OBJECTIVES: The Maryland Orthopaedic Registry (MOR) was established to assess post-surgical outcomes related to patients' pain, functional status, met expectations, and satisfaction using an electronic data collection system. Secondary aims of the registry include assessment of patient expectations of treatment, activity level, and general health status. METHODS: Adult patients enrolled in this prospective observational study completed self-report measures assessing pre-operative pain, function, treatment expectations, and activity levels during the perioperative period. MOR utilizes the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R)))'computer adaptive testing for physical function, pain interference, fatigue, social satisfaction, anxiety, and depression. Perioperative data is extracted from the medical record. RESULTS: 300 patients (40% of eligible) have been enrolled into the initial cohort. Most patients (94.1%) were aged 18-65, and 57% were male. Fifty-seven percent of enrollees were White, 33% Black, and 4% Asian. PROMIS physical function and social satisfaction were both more than half a standard deviation below the population mean. Participants reported PROMIS anxiety scores that were half a standard deviation above the population mean and pain interference scores that were more than a standard deviation above the mean. Physical function scores were significantly worse among participants with lower extremity orthopaedic issues, but scores on other measures were similar between participants undergoing lower or upper extremity surgery. CONCLUSIONS: MOR provides a comprehensive assessment of patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. The utilization of electronic clinical assessment tools as well as computer adaptive testing allows for time-efficient data collection. The diverse population is a particular strength of MOR.

AB  - PURPOSE: The relationship between psychosocial factors and self-reported physical function among hand and upper extremity patients is complex. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) platform has attempted to create a variety of specifically targeted metrics that can be administered using computer adaptive testing (CAT). Three metrics measuring self-reported physical function (herein referred to in combination as "functional" metrics) include the PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT, PROMIS Upper Extremity (UE) CAT, and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH). Two metrics assessing psychosocial factors include the PROMIS Anxiety and Pain Interference (PI) CATs ("nonfunctional" metrics). This study evaluates whether the functional metrics were correlated with nonfunctional metrics. METHODS: The 5 questionnaires were administered prospectively on a tablet computer to all consecutive adult patients presenting to an outpatient hand and upper extremity (nonshoulder) clinic at a tertiary academic medical center from January 1 to November 1, 2014. For patients with multiple visits during the study period, only the first was included. Data were evaluated retrospectively to assess the relationship between functional and nonfunctional measures, with Pearson correlation coefficients to understand the relationship between continuous variables, and 1-way analysis of variance to examine for differences in outcome measures across demographic groups. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine factors predicting functional disability. RESULTS: We included 1,299 patients: mean age was 46.8 years, 53% were female, and 23% were unemployed or on disability. The PROMIS PF CAT, PROMIS UE CAT, and QuickDASH scores were all significantly correlated with PROMIS Anxiety CAT (Pearson correlation coefficients, -0.46, -0.48, and 0.53, respectively) and PROMIS PI CAT (-0.60, -0.65, and 0.76, respectively) scores. Multivariable regression analyses demonstrated that increased PROMIS Anxiety and PI CAT scores each independently and adversely influenced PROMIS PF CAT, PROMIS UE CAT, and QuickDASH scores. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of patient anxiety and pain interference are independently associated with decreased patient-reported upper extremity function. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides further support of the biopsychosocial model by highlighting that increased anxiety is associated with decreased self-reported function using the PROMIS platform.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2009, the Army Pain Management Task Force was chartered. On the basis of their findings, the Department of Defense recommended a comprehensive pain management strategy that included development of a standardized pain assessment system that would collect patient-reported outcomes data to inform the patient-provider clinical encounter. The result was the Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR). The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and response burden of the patient-reported outcome measures in PASTOR. METHODS: Data for analyses were collected from 681 individuals who completed PASTOR at baseline and follow-up as part of their routine clinical care. The survey tool included self-report measures of pain severity and pain interference (measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System [PROMIS] and the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating scale). PROMIS measures of pain correlates also were administered. Validation analyses included estimation of score associations among measures, comparison of scores of known groups, responsiveness, ceiling and floor effects, and response burden. RESULTS: Results of psychometric testing provided substantial evidence for the validity of PASTOR self-report measures in this population. Expected associations among scores largely supported the concurrent validity of the measures. Scores effectively distinguished among respondents on the basis of their self-reported impressions of general health. PROMIS measures were administered using computer adaptive testing and each, on average, required less than 1 minute to administer. Statistical and graphical analyses demonstrated the responsiveness of PASTOR measures over time.

AB  - CONTEXT: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. METHODS: Patients (ages 7-22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. RESULTS: Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

AB  - The potential impact of brain training methods for enhancing human cognition in healthy and clinical populations has motivated increasing public interest and scientific scrutiny. At issue is the merits of intervention modalities, such as computer-based cognitive training, physical exercise training, and non-invasive brain stimulation, and whether such interventions synergistically enhance cognition. To investigate this issue, we conducted a comprehensive 4-month randomized controlled trial in which 318 healthy, young adults were enrolled in one of five interventions: (1) Computer-based cognitive training on six adaptive tests of executive function; (2) Cognitive and physical exercise training; (3) Cognitive training combined with non-invasive brain stimulation and physical exercise training; (4) Active control training in adaptive visual search and change detection tasks; and (5) Passive control. Our findings demonstrate that multimodal training significantly enhanced learning (relative to computer-based cognitive training alone) and provided an effective method to promote skill learning across multiple cognitive domains, spanning executive functions, working memory, and planning and problem solving. These results help to establish the beneficial effects of multimodal intervention and identify key areas for future research in the continued effort to improve human cognition.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the performance of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity (UE) Function Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) relative to the PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT in patients seeking specialty care for upper extremity conditions. METHODS: This observational trial analyzed prospectively collected PROMIS UE and PF CAT scores from 5,202 adult patients with 10,344 outpatient clinic visits presenting to a tertiary orthopedic clinic. Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the association between initial PF and UE scores as well as the association between changes in PF and UE scores between visits. Differences in scores between populations presenting with hand conditions versus shoulder and elbow conditions were evaluated via Student t test, as were differences in scores between new and return patient visits. RESULTS: The PROMIS UE CAT scores were strongly correlated with PROMIS PF CAT scores. However, patients averaged 8 points lower scoring on UE CAT testing than on PF CAT scores. The UE CAT demonstrated a ceiling effect at a score of 56 that affected 7% of patients with a secondary ceiling at 50. Changes in PF and UE scores between visits were moderately correlated with a mean difference of less than 1 point. Patients presenting for hand conditions achieved better PF and UE scores than patients presenting for shoulder and elbow conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS UE module appears responsive to changes over time. However, the current UE CAT has a ceiling score of 56, which does not allow for improvement of scores 0.6 SD higher than the presumptive normative population mean of 50. Although a specific assessment of upper extremity function is desirable, continued refinement of the PROMIS UE CAT is required to better assess patients with higher levels of function.

AB  - We developed a Dutch-Flemish version of the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) adult V1.0 item bank for depression as input for computerized adaptive testing (CAT). As item bank, we used the Dutch-Flemish translation of the original PROMIS item bank (28 items) and additionally translated 28 U.S. depression items that failed to make the final U.S. item bank. Through psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample ( N = 2,010), 8 added items were removed. With the final item bank, we performed several CAT simulations to assess the efficiency of the extended (48 items) and the original item bank (28 items), using various stopping rules. Both item banks resulted in highly efficient and precise measurement of depression and showed high similarity between the CAT simulation scores and the full item bank scores. We discuss the implications of using each item bank and stopping rule for further CAT development.

AB  - Computer adaptive testing (CAT) is a kind of tailored testing, in that it is a form of computer-based testing that is adaptive to each test-taker's ability level. In this review, the impacts of CAT are discussed from different perspectives in order to illustrate crucial points to keep in mind during the development and implementation of CAT. Test developers and psychometricians often emphasize the efficiency and accuracy of CAT in comparison to traditional linear tests. However, many test-takers report feeling discouraged after taking CATs, and this feeling can reduce learning self-efficacy and motivation. A trade-off must be made between the psychological experiences of test-takers and measurement efficiency. From the perspective of educators and subject matter experts, nonstatistical specifications, such as content coverage, content balance, and form length are major concerns. Thus, accreditation bodies may be faced with a discrepancy between the perspectives of psychometricians and those of subject matter experts. In order to improve test-takers' impressions of CAT, the author proposes increasing the target probability of answering correctly in the item selection algorithm even if doing so consequently decreases measurement efficiency. Two different methods, CAT with a shadow test approach and computerized multistage testing, have been developed in order to ensure the satisfaction of subject matter experts. In the shadow test approach, a full-length test is assembled that meets the constraints and provides maximum information at the current ability estimate, while computerized multistage testing gives subject matter experts an opportunity to review all test forms prior to administration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current suicide risk screening and measurement are inefficient, have limited measurement precision, and focus entirely on suicide-related items. For this study, a psychometric harmonization between related suicide, depression, and anxiety symptom domains that provides a more balanced and complete spectrum of suicidal symptomatology was developed. The objective of this article is to describe the results of the early stages of computerized adaptive testing development for a suicide scale and pave the way for the final stage of validation. METHODS: Data from psychiatric outpatients at the University of Pittsburgh and a community health clinic were collected from January 2010 through June 2012. 789 participants were enrolled in the calibration phase; 70% were female, and 30% were male. The rate of major depressive disorder as diagnosed by DSM-5 was 47%. The item bank contained 1,008 items related to depression, anxiety, and mania, including 11 suicide items. Data were analyzed using a bifactor model to identify a core dimension between suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and mania items. A computerized adaptive test was developed via simulation from the actual complete item responses in 308 subjects. RESULTS: 111 items were identified that provided an extension of suicidality assessment to include statistically related responses from depression and anxiety domains that are syndromally associated with suicidality. All items had high loadings on the primary suicide dimension (average = 0.67; range, 0.49-0.88). Analyses revealed that a mean of 10 items (5-20) had a correlation of 0.96 with the 111-item scale, with a precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale metric. Preliminary validation data based on 290 clinician interviews revealed a 52-fold increase in the likelihood of current suicidal ideation across the range of the Computerized Adaptive Test Suicide Scale (CAT-SS). CONCLUSIONS: The CAT-SS is able to accurately measure the latent suicide dimension with a mean of 10 items in approximately 2 minutes. Further validation against an independent clinician-administered assessment of suicide risk (ideation and attempts) and prediction of suicidal behavior is underway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative developed an array of patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. To reduce the number of questions administered, PROMIS utilizes unidimensional item response theory and unidimensional computer adaptive testing (UCAT), which means a separate set of questions is administered for each measured trait. Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) and multidimensional computer adaptive testing (MCAT) simultaneously assess correlated traits. The objective was to investigate the extent to which MCAT reduces patient burden relative to UCAT in the case of PROs. METHODS: One MIRT and 3 unidimensional item response theory models were developed using the related traits anxiety, depression, and anger. Using these models, MCAT and UCAT performance was compared with simulated individuals. RESULTS: Surprisingly, the root mean squared error for both methods increased with the number of items. These results were driven by large errors for individuals with low trait levels. A second analysis focused on individuals aligned with item content. For these individuals, both MCAT and UCAT accuracies improved with additional items. Furthermore, MCAT reduced the test length by 50%. DISCUSSION: For the PROMIS Emotional Distress banks, neither UCAT nor MCAT provided accurate estimates for individuals at low trait levels. Because the items in these banks were designed to detect clinical levels of distress, there is little information for individuals with low trait values. However, trait estimates for individuals targeted by the banks were accurate and MCAT asked substantially fewer questions. CONCLUSION: By reducing the number of items administered, MCAT can allow clinicians and researchers to assess a wider range of PROs with less patient burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficient screening questionnaires are useful in general practice. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a method to improve the efficiency of questionnaires, as only the items that are particularly informative for a certain responder are dynamically selected. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT could improve the efficiency of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ), a frequently used self-report questionnaire designed to assess common psychosocial problems in general practice. METHODS: A simulation study was conducted using a sample of Dutch patients visiting a general practitioner (GP) with psychological problems (n=379). Responders completed a paper-and-pencil version of the 50-item 4DSQ and a psychometric evaluation was performed to check if the data agreed with item response theory (IRT) assumptions. Next, a CAT simulation was performed for each of the four 4DSQ scales (distress, depression, anxiety, and somatization), based on the given responses as if they had been collected through CAT. The following two stopping rules were applied for the administration of items: (1) stop if measurement precision is below a predefined level, or (2) stop if more than half of the items of the subscale are administered. RESULTS: In general, the items of each of the four scales agreed with IRT assumptions. Application of the first stopping rule reduced the length of the questionnaire by 38% (from 50 to 31 items on average). When the second stopping rule was also applied, the total number of items could be reduced by 56% (from 50 to 22 items on average). CONCLUSIONS: CAT seems useful for improving the efficiency of the 4DSQ by 56% without losing a considerable amount of measurement precision. The CAT version of the 4DSQ may be useful as part of an online assessment to investigate the severity of mental health problems of patients visiting a GP. This simulation study is the first step needed for the development a CAT version of the 4DSQ. A CAT version of the 4DSQ could be of high value for Dutch GPs since increasing numbers of patients with mental health problems are visiting the general practice. In further research, the results of a real-time CAT should be compared with the results of the administration of the full scale.

AB  - Background: Almost 2 decades have passed since the development of the items contained in the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and during this time, daily tasks have changed to adapt to changes in technology. Methods: A cohort of 108 patients completed demographic information, the Quick DASH (both standard and technologically updated versions), and 2 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-based computerized adaptive testing questionnaires: PROMIS pain interference and upper-extremity function. To create a technologically updated Quick DASH, we substituted 3 items from the standard Quick DASH questionnaire with 3 other items related to the use of technology: (1) Text or dial with your cell phone, (2) Type on a keyboard, and (3) Use a computer mouse. Results: The technologically updated Quick DASH questionnaire had lower scores compared with the standard Quick DASH (37 vs. 33, respectively), but they had a large correlation and both had high internal consistency. The items "Text or dial with your cell phone" and "Use a computer mouse" in the updated Quick DASH questionnaire had the lowest scores. Except for affected side, the standard Quick DASH and updated Quick DASH were influenced by the same factors. PROMIS pain interference was the only independent variable affecting both questionnaire scores. Conclusions: A technologically updated Quick DASH had no advantage over the standard Quick DASH.

AB  - The current study investigated the utility and validity of a computerized "depression" module of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Second version (MMPI-2), with and without sequential testing rules, with a college student sample. Participants completed one of three MMPI-2 test-retest administrations (i.e., conventional-conventional, conventional-module, or conventional-sequential module) as well as 15 criterion measures across two testing sessions exactly 1 week apart. The findings pointed to statistically significant and clinically meaningful time-savings in administering selected MMPI-2 scales (for both full-length and variable-length versions). Criterion measures rationally selected to represent similar (depression, anhedonia, anxiety) and dissimilar (behavioral, thought, and somatic dysfunction) psychological constructs were administered to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the depression module. The criterion correlations suggested minimal differences in discriminant and convergent validity across administration modes, suggesting limited to no impact of administering targeted MMPI-2 scales in terms of construct validity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess reliability and validity of three single leg standing clinical tests in patients with plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS). DESIGN: Cross-sectional reliability study. PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients diagnosed with PHPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients stood on their affected foot in a static stance for up to 30seconds, a half squat for up to 10 repetitions, and a heel rise for up to 10 repetitions. The first sensation of pain (p1) determined the termination of each test, and established a positive test result. The level of p1 was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS); time or repetitions for each test were recorded. Prior to performing the tests, all patients completed the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test to measure functional status (FS). RESULTS: Detection of p1 in each test showed good reliability for inter- and intrarater assessment (Kappa=0.60 to 0.78 and 0.56 to 0.77, respectively). The intraclass correlation coefficient for the VAS measures was 0.85 to 0.95 for inter-rater assessment and 0.78 to 0.92 for intrarater assessment. However, the Bland and Altman limits of agreement were wide, indicating that these measures were less reliable than the correlation coefficients suggested. Thirty-five patients (88%) experienced a positive pain response to at least one test. Significant correlations were found between the VAS measures in each test and FS (r=0.63 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The static stance, half squat and heel rise tests were easily implemented, and found to be reliable and valid according to one analysis, yet less reliable with another, for pain provocation and VAS levels in patients with PHPS. All three VAS levels correlated well with FS.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

AB  - The patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) provides clinicians and researchers access to reliable, validated measures of physical, mental, and social well-being. The use of PROMIS can facilitate comparisons among clinical subpopulations and with the U.S. general population. We report on the first study using PROMIS measures in patients with neurofibromatosis (NF). Eighty-six adult patients (mean age = 44; 55% female; 87% white; 50% NF1, 41% NF2 and 9% schwannomatosis) completed a battery of PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CATs). Across all PROMIS instruments, mean scores for each CAT were between 48.97 and 52.60, which is within +/-0.5 SD of the U.S. general population norms. However, scores were distributed across a broad range for each PROMIS measure (+/-3 SDs). Clinically meaningful scores (defined >1 SD impairment) were observed in 20% (pain interference), 17% (pain behavior), 16% (physical function), 16% (anxiety), 16% (depression), 15% (satisfaction with social roles), 13% (fatigue), 6% (anger), and 5% (satisfaction with discretionary social activities) of the sample. All PROMIS measures were highly interrelated in bivariate analysis (P </= .001). There were no differences in PROMIS scores by disease type (NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis), or self reported learning disabilities, or compared with the US population. Scores suggest a broad continuum of symptoms and functioning in patients with NF that is not affected by NF type, as well as interrelation among the physical and psychosocial domains as measured by PROMIS. PROMIS measures may be useful in clinical practice to monitor changes in symptoms and functioning over time, as well as in clinical trials to determine patient reported changes during drug and psychosocial clinical trials.

AB  - Due to its high dimensionality and high noise levels, analysis of a large brain functional network may not be powerful and easy to interpret; instead, decomposition of a large network into smaller subcomponents called modules may be more promising as suggested by some empirical evidence. For example, alteration of brain modularity is observed in patients suffering from various types of brain malfunctions. Although several methods exist for estimating brain functional networks, such as the sample correlation matrix or graphical lasso for a sparse precision matrix, it is still difficult to extract modules from such network estimates. Motivated by these considerations, we adapt a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) framework to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data to identify modular structures in brain functional networks. Modular structures are identified by using topological overlap matrix (TOM) elements in hierarchical clustering. We propose applying a new adaptive test built on the proportional odds model (POM) that can be applied to a high-dimensional setting, where the number of variables (p) can exceed the sample size (n) in addition to the usual p < n setting. We applied our proposed methods to the ADNI data to test for associations between a genetic variant and either the whole brain functional network or its various subcomponents using various connectivity measures. We uncovered several modules based on the control cohort, and some of them were marginally associated with the APOE4 variant and several other SNPs; however, due to the small sample size of the ADNI data, larger studies are needed.

AB  - The development of the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory (ESI) was motivated by the need to comprehensively assess the interrelated nature of externalizing psychopathology and personality using an empirically driven framework. The ESI measures 23 theoretically distinct yet related unidimensional facets of externalizing, which are structured under 3 superordinate factors representing general externalizing, callous aggression, and substance abuse. One limitation of the ESI is its length at 415 items. To facilitate the use of the ESI in busy clinical and research settings, the current study sought to examine the efficiency and accuracy of a computerized adaptive version of the ESI. Data were collected over 3 waves and totaled 1,787 participants recruited from undergraduate psychology courses as well as male and female state prisons. A series of 6 algorithms with different termination rules were simulated to determine the efficiency and accuracy of each test under 3 different assumed distributions. Scores generated using an optimal adaptive algorithm evidenced high correlations (r > .9) with scores generated using the full ESI, brief ESI item-based factor scales, and the 23 facet scales. The adaptive algorithms for each facet administered a combined average of 115 items, a 72% decrease in comparison to the full ESI. Similarly, scores on the item-based factor scales of the ESI-brief form (57 items) were generated using on average of 17 items, a 70% decrease. The current study successfully demonstrates that an adaptive algorithm can generate similar scores for the ESI and the 3 item-based factor scales using a fraction of the total item pool.

AB  - Backgound : Assessing specific personality traits has shown better predictive power of enterprising personality than have broad personality traits. Hitherto, there have been no instruments that evaluate the combination of specific personality traits of enterprising personality in an adaptive format. So, the aim was to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) to assess enterprising personality in young people. METHODS: A pool of 161 items was developed and applied to two sets of participants (n 1 = 357 students, M age = 17.89; SD age = 3.26; n 2 = 2,693 students; M age = 16.52, SD age = 1.38) using a stratified sampling method. RESULTS: 107 items that assess achievement motivation, risk-taking, innovativeness, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, internal locus of control, and optimism were selected. The assumption of unidimensionality was tested. The CAT demonstrated high precision for a wide range of q, using a mean of 10 items and demonstrating a relatively low Standard Error (0.378). CONCLUSIONS: A brief, valid, and precise instrument was obtained with relevant implications for educational and entrepreneurial contexts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) have been proposed to facilitate assessments in mental health. These tests are built in a standard way, disregarding useful and usually available information not included in the assessment scales that could increase the precision and utility of CATs, such as the history of suicide attempts. METHODS: Using the items of a previously developed scale for suicidal risk, we compared the performance of a standard CAT and a decision tree in a support decision system to identify suicidal behavior. We included the history of past suicide attempts as a class for the separation of patients in the decision tree. RESULTS: The decision tree needed an average of four items to achieve a similar accuracy than a standard CAT with nine items. The accuracy of the decision tree, obtained after 25 cross-validations, was 81.4%. A shortened test adapted for the separation of suicidal and non-suicidal patients was developed. CONCLUSION: CATs can be very useful tools for the assessment of suicidal risk. However, standard CATs do not use all the information that is available. A decision tree can improve the precision of the assessment since they are constructed using a priori information.

CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life is inconsistently captured among children with cleft lip and palate. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) captures health-related quality of life, with the added benefit of comparability across clinical conditions. In this study, the authors define the validity and feasibility of PROMIS among children with clefts. METHODS: Children with cleft lip and palate who were at least 5 years old and able to complete instruments independently were eligible for inclusion (n = 93). Children completed PROMIS anxiety, depression, and peer relationship item banks as short forms or computerized adaptive tests. Participants also completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Construct validity was measured by Spearman correlations between PROMIS and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory controlling for race, sex, age, and income. Feasibility was measured using instrument completion time, reading level, and floor/ceiling effects. RESULTS: PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (peer relationship, r = 0.49; depression, r = -0.56; and anxiety, r = -0.36) and short forms (peer relationship, r = 0.65; depression, r = -0.54; and anxiety, r = -0.56) demonstrated moderate correlation with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Computerized adaptive tests had fewer floor (0 percent versus 0 percent) and ceiling (8.6 to 19.3 percent versus 21.8 to 41.9 percent) effects than short forms, and demonstrated better readability. Computerized adaptive tests required more time than short forms (peer relationship, 0.84 +/- 0.67 versus 1.3 +/- 0.92; depression, 0.52 +/- 0.38 versus 1.1 +/- 0.73; and anxiety, 0.53 +/- 0.23 versus 1.1 +/- 0.62; p = 0.001), as each computerized adaptive test included on average four more questions. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS correlates well with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and demonstrates similar accuracy, with better readability and efficiency. Use of PROMIS will improve our ability to compare children with cleft lip and palate to diverse populations and clinical conditions. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic, II.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the proportion and characteristics of patients with late stage cancer that are and are not receptive to receiving rehabilitation services, and the rationale for their level of interest. DESIGN: Prospective mixed-methods study. SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center in a quaternary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with stage IIIC or IV non-small cell or extensive stage small cell lung cancer (N=311). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Telephone-acquired responses to the administration of (1) the Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM-PAC-CAT); (2) numerical rating scales for pain, dyspnea, fatigue, general emotional distress, and distress associated with functional limitations; (3) a query regarding receptivity to receipt of rehabilitation services, and (4) a query about rationale for nonreceptivity. RESULTS: Overall, 99 (31.8%) of the study's 311 participants expressed interest in receiving rehabilitation services: 38 at the time of enrollment and an additional 61 during at least 1 subsequent contact. Participants expressing interest were more likely to have a child as primary caregiver (18.18% vs 9.91%, P=.04) and a musculoskeletal comorbidity (42.4% vs 31.6%, P=.05). Function-related distress was highly associated with receptivity, as were lower AM-PAC-CAT scores. Reasons provided for lack of interest in receiving services included a perception of their limited benefit, being too busy, and prioritization below more pressing tasks/concerns. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients with late stage lung cancer are likely to be interested in receiving rehabilitation services despite high levels of disability and related distress. These findings suggest that patient misperception of the role of rehabilitation services may be a barrier to improved function and quality of life. Efforts to educate patients on the benefits of rehabilitation and to more formally integrate rehabilitation as part of comprehensive care may curb these missed opportunities.

This study aims at investigating the criterion validity, and identifying appropriate cut-off values for its use in cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: 106 cardiovascular rehabilitation patients were tested for anxiety disorders using the instruments ACAT-cardio and SKID-I. Receiver operating characteristics were employed to analyse the results of 3 stopping rules of the ACAT-cardio. RESULTS: ROC analyses for the stopping rules yielded areas under the curve (AUC) between 0.80 and 0.84. The ideal cut-off values of the ACAT-cardio (theta scores) were - 0.20 (sensitivity: 86%),-0.23 (sensitivity: 71%) and - 0.35 (sensitivity: 86%). CONCLUSIONS: The ACAT-cardio has proven to be a valid instrument that can be used for screening anxiety disorders in cardiac rehabilitation.

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for positive and negative psychotic experiences were developed and tested in N = 5705 help-seeking, non-psychotic young individuals. Instead of presenting all items, CATs choose a varying number of different items during test administration depending on respondents' previous answers, reducing the average number of items while still obtaining accurate person estimates. We assessed the appropriateness of two-parameter logistic models to positive and negative symptoms of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ), computed measurement precision of all items and resulting adaptive tests along psychotic dimensions by Real Data Simulations (RDS), and computed indices for criterion and predictive validities of the CATs. For all items, mean absolute differences between observed and expected response probabilities were smaller than 0.02. CAT-POS predicted transition to psychosis and duration of hospitalization in individuals at-risk for psychosis, and CAT-NEG was suggestively related to later functioning. Regarding psychosis risk classifications of help-seeking individuals, CAT-POS performed less than the PQ-16. Adaptive testing based on self-reported positive and negative symptoms in individuals at-risk for psychosis is a feasible method to select patients for further risk classification. These promising findings need to be replicated prospectively in a non-selective sample that also includes non-at-risk individuals. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acupuncture has been shown to alleviate symptoms and increase general well-being in different medical patient samples. A major challenge in acupuncture clinical research is the availability of comparable and standardized patient-reported outcome measurement (PRO) tools. OBJECTIVES: This study used a pragmatic design to examine longitudinal changes in quality of life (QOL) in a medical patient sample following acupuncture using PROs from the National Institutes of Health's Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative. It also examined the role of acupuncture expectancies, as well as patient and provider perceptions of acupuncture benefit. DESIGN: Following informed consent, patients completed baseline QOL measures (T1) prior to their first acupuncture session. Subsequent assessments (up to 20) were completed immediately following ensuing acupuncture sessions. Patients completed assessments either on a touch-screen computer at the clinic or from their home computer. RESULTS: Compared with acupuncture-naive participants, those who received prior acupuncture treatment reported significantly higher anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and lower positive affect at baseline. By the second assessment, however, these differences became nonexistent. Participants who held greater baseline acupuncture expectations (e.g., their situation would improve a lot, they would have improved coping skills, their symptoms would disappear, their energy would increase) reported significantly higher fatigue, pain interference, and problems with physical functioning. Between T1 and T2, all participants reported significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Exploratory longitudinal models demonstrated significant linear improvements over time in anxiety (p = 0.006), depression (p = 0.007), pain interference (p < 0.001), and sleep disturbance (p = 0.004). No linear reduction over time was found with fatigue (p = 0.587), physical function (p = 0.654), or positive affect (p = 0.247). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, PROMIS computer adaptive tests were able to assess domains of QOL briefly. Although pretreatment acupuncture expectations highlighted subgroup differences in outcomes at baseline, linear-growth models demonstrated the positive effects of acupuncture over time on anxiety, depression, pain interference, and sleep disturbance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is widely used as an outcome measure in the evaluation of treatment interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In order to address challenges associated with existing fixed-length measures (e.g., too long to be used routinely, too short to ensure both content validity and reliability), a COPD-specific item bank (COPD-SIB) was developed. METHODS: Items were selected based on literature review and interviews with Dutch COPD patients, with a strong focus on both content validity and item comprehension. The psychometric quality of the item bank was evaluated using Mokken Scale Analysis and parametric Item Response Theory, using data of 666 COPD patients. RESULTS: The final item bank contains 46 items that form a strong scale, tapping into eight important themes that were identified based on literature review and patient interviews: Coping with disease/symptoms, adaptability; Autonomy; Anxiety about the course/end-state of the disease, hopelessness; Positive psychological functioning; Situations triggering or enhancing breathing problems; Symptoms; Activity; Impact. CONCLUSIONS: The 46-item COPD-SIB has good psychometric properties and content validity. Items are available in Dutch and English. The COPD-SIB can be used as a stand-alone instrument, or to inform computerised adaptive testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in psychometric modeling and technology allow pooling well-validated items from existing instruments into larger item banks and their deployment through methods of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Use of item response theory-based bifactor methods and integrative data analysis overcomes barriers in cross-instrument comparison. This paper presents the joint calibration of an item bank for researchers keen to investigate population variations in general psychological distress (GPD). METHODS: Multidimensional item response theory was used on existing health survey data from the Scottish Health Education Population Survey (n = 766) to calibrate an item bank consisting of pooled items from the short common mental disorder screen (GHQ-12) and the Affectometer-2 (a measure of "general happiness"). Computer simulation was used to evaluate usefulness and efficacy of its adaptive administration. RESULTS: A bifactor model capturing variation across a continuum of population distress (while controlling for artefacts due to item wording) was supported. The numbers of items for different required reliabilities in adaptive administration demonstrated promising efficacy of the proposed item bank. CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric modeling of the common dimension captured by more than one instrument offers the potential of adaptive testing for GPD using individually sequenced combinations of existing survey items. The potential for linking other item sets with alternative candidate measures of positive mental health is discussed since an optimal item bank may require even more items than these.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain intensity and disability correlate with psychosocial factors such as depression and pain interference (the degree to which pain interferes with activities of daily living) as much or more than pathophysiology in upper extremity illness. However, other factors like emotional support (perception of being cared for and valued as a person), instrumental support (perception of availability of tangible assistance when needed), positive psychosocial impact (perception and focus on the positive side of a difficult situation, sometimes characterized as posttraumatic growth, benefit-finding, or meaning making), also might be associated with disability in patients with upper extremity orthopaedic illness. This is the first published study, to our knowledge, addressing the potential association of emotional support, instrumental support, and positive psychosocial illness impact with disability in patients with upper extremity illness. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Is there a correlation between the QuickDASH and the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R))) emotional support Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT)? (2) Is there a correlation between the QuickDASH and PROMIS((R)) instrumental support CAT? (3) Is there a correlation between the QuickDASH and PROMIS((R)) positive psychosocial illness impact CAT? (4) Among the PROMIS((R)) measures of depression, emotional support, instrumental support, positive illness impact, and pain interference, which accounts for the most variance in QuickDASH scores? METHODS: One hundred ninety-three patients with upper extremity illness (55% women; average age, 51 +/- 18 years) of 213 approached (91% recruitment rate) completed the QuickDASH, and five different PROMIS((R)) CATs: pain interference (the degree to which pain interferes with accomplishing one's goals), depression, emotional support, psychosocial illness impact, and instrumental support. We recruited patients from the practice of three surgeons in hand service of the department of orthopaedic surgery at a major urban university hospital. RESULTS: Pearson Product Moment Correlations showed that emotional support (r = -0.18; p = 0.014) and instrumental support (r = -0.19; p = 0.008) were weakly and inversely associated with the QuickDASH), while positive psychosocial illness impact was moderately and inversely associated with the QuickDASH (r = -0.36; p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, pain interference, but not the social support measures, was the only psychosocial factor associated with the QuickDASH and alone explained 66% of variance. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional support, instrumental support and positive psychosocial illness impact are all individually associated with disability to a small degree, but pain interference (the degree to which pain interferes with accomplishing one's goals) has the strongest influence on magnitude of disability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the precision and construct validity of pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments in a population of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients and parent proxies. METHODS: A convenience sample of JIA patients and parents of JIA patients completed PROMIS instruments for 8 domains: anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, mobility, pain interference, peer relationships, and upper-extremity function. Short form and computerized adaptive test (CAT) scores were derived from item bank responses. Raw scores were translated to standardized T scores with corresponding SEs. Discrimination between inactive versus active disease was evaluated as an indicator of each measure's construct validity. SEs were plotted to evaluate each instrument's relative precision. Patient-parent concordance was assessed using intraclass correlations (ICCs). RESULTS: A total of 228 patients and 223 parents participated, providing 71-78 responses per domain. Patient- and parent-reported anger, fatigue, mobility, and pain interference scores significantly differed between those with inactive and active disease. Anxiety, depressive symptoms, and peer relationships differed by disease activity levels for parent-report only. Short forms and CATs provided comparable reliability to the full item banks across the full range of each outcome. Patient-parent agreement ranged from ICC 0.3 to 0.8. CATs did not reduce the number of items for any domain compared to the short form. CONCLUSION: Precision and discriminatory abilities of PROMIS instruments depend on health domain and report type (self-report versus parent proxy-report) for children with JIA. Varying levels of patient-parent concordance reinforces the importance of considering both perspectives in comprehensive health outcomes assessments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is a useful tool for evaluating mechanical sensitivity in patients suffering from various musculoskeletal disorders. However, no previous study has investigated PPT in the heel of patients experiencing plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS). The aim of this study was to compare PPT levels and topographic presentation of sensitivity in the heel of patients with PHPS and in healthy controls. METHODS: The reliability of PPT testing in patients with PHPS was assessed for intra- and interrater recordings. The PPT levels of 40 feet in each group were then assessed on 5 predetermined sites in the heel using a standardized measurement protocol. Patient functional status (FS) as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was employed as an external reference. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed no group differences for PPTs at all sites (P = .406). Age (P = .099) or BMI (P = .510) did not affect PPT values, although there was an effect on gender (P = .006). The analysis revealed significant differences between sites (P < .001) demonstrating a diverse topographic distribution. In the PHPS group, PPT levels at the anterior/medial, posterior/medial and central sites were significantly lower than at the posterior/lateral and anterior/lateral sites (P < .05). For the control group, PPT levels at the anterior/medial site were significantly lower than all other sites (P < .001). CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found between PPT of the PHPS patients and controls, therefore, PPT cannot be recommended as an assessment tool for these patients. The topographic distribution indicated low PPT levels at the anterior/medial area of the heel in patients with PHPS and controls. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia affects up to 10% of pregnancies worldwide and is one of the main causes of fetal morbidity and mortality. Although it has been linked to developmental delay, its long-term effects on neurologic development in children have yet to be sufficiently quantified. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether preeclampsia's severity and its obstetric management correlate to the degree of disability in these infants. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This is an observational and descriptive study performed on a population of 96 women who were diagnosed with preeclampsia at Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon between 2007 and 2014, and their 111 children. To evaluate the mother, we gathered data pertaining to her medical history, renal function markers, and medical management of the preeclampsia. To assess the children, we collected fetal growth measurements, acute fetal distress markers and main diagnoses at birth. We used the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory in its computerized adaptive test version (PEDI-CAT) to study performance in the relevant areas, and the TNO-AZL Preschool children Quality of Life (TAPQOL) to estimate health-related quality of life. RESULTS: PEDI-CAT percentiles were consistently lower in the social/cognitive domain than in other areas. Lower social/cognitive percentiles were associated to both lower maternal IgG levels and presence of necrotizing enterocolitis during the neonatal period. CONCLUSIONS: A connection between preeclampsia and poor social/cognitive outcomes exists that warrants further research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness to change of the PROMIS negative affect measures (depression, anxiety, and anger) using longitudinal data collected in six chronic health conditions. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), back pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and cancer completed PROMIS negative affect instruments as computerized adaptive test or as fixed-length short form at baseline and a clinically relevant follow-up interval. Participants also completed global ratings of health. Linear mixed effects models and standardized response means (SRM) were estimated at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 903 individuals participated (back pain, n = 218; cancer, n = 304; CHF, n = 60; COPD, n = 125; MDD, n = 196). All three negative affect instruments improved significantly for treatments of depression and pain. Depression improved for CHF patients (anxiety and anger not administered), whereas anxiety improved significantly in COPD groups (stable and exacerbation). Response to treatment was not assessed in cancer. Subgroups of patients reporting better or worse health showed a corresponding positive or negative average SRM for negative affect across samples. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the PROMIS negative affect scores are sensitive to change in intervention studies in which negative affect is expected to change. These results inform the estimation of meaningful change and enable comparative effectiveness research.

AB  - Reducing the response burden of standardized pain measures is desirable, particularly for individuals who are frail or live with chronic illness, e.g., those suffering from cancer and those in palliative care. The Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System((R)) (PROMIS((R))) project addressed this issue with the provision of computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and short form measures that can be used clinically and in research. Although there has been substantial evaluation of PROMIS item banks, little is known about the performance of PROMIS short forms, particularly in ethnically diverse groups. Reviewed in this article are findings related to the differential item functioning (DIF) and reliability of the PROMIS pain interference short forms across diverse sociodemographic groups. METHODS: DIF hypotheses were generated for the PROMIS short form pain interference items. Initial analyses tested item response theory (IRT) model assumptions of unidimensionality and local independence. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor analytic methods; local dependence (LD) was tested using IRT-based LD indices. Wald tests were used to examine group differences in IRT parameters, and to test DIF hypotheses. A second DIF-detection method used in sensitivity analyses was based on ordinal logistic regression with a latent IRT-derived conditioning variable. Magnitude and impact of DIF were investigated, and reliability and item and scale information statistics were estimated. RESULTS: The reliability of the short form item set was excellent. However, there were a few items with high local dependency, which affected the estimation of the final discrimination parameters. As a result, the item, "How much did pain interfere with enjoyment of social activities?" was excluded in the DIF analyses for all subgroup comparisons. No items were hypothesized to show DIF for race and ethnicity; however, five items showed DIF after adjustment for multiple comparisons in both primary and sensitivity analyses: ability to concentrate, enjoyment of recreational activities, tasks away from home, participation in social activities, and socializing with others. The magnitude of DIF was small and the impact negligible. Three items were consistently identified with DIF for education: enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, and enjoyment of recreational activities. No item showed DIF above the magnitude threshold and the impact of DIF on the overall measure was minimal. No item showed gender DIF after correction for multiple comparisons in the primary analyses. Four items showed consistent age DIF: enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, day to day activities, and enjoyment of recreational activities, none with primary magnitude values above threshold. Conditional on the pain state, Spanish speakers were hypothesized to report less pain interference on one item, enjoyment of life. The DIF findings confirmed the hypothesis; however, the magnitude was small. Using an arbitrary cutoff point of theta (theta) >/= 1.0 to classify respondents with acute pain interference, the highest number of changes were for the education groups analyses. There were 231 respondents (4% of the total sample) who changed from the designation of no acute pain interference to acute interference after the DIF adjustment. There was no change in the designations for race/ethnic subgroups, and a small number of changes for respondents aged 65 to 84. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant DIF was observed after correction for multiple comparisons, all DIF was of low magnitude and impact. However, some individual-level impact was observed for low education groups. Reliability estimates were high. Thus, the PROMIS short form pain items examined in this ethnically diverse sample performed relatively well; although one item was problematic and removed from the analyses. It is concluded that the majority of the PROMIS pain interference short form items can be recommended for use among ethnically diverse groups, including those in palliative care and with cancer and chronic illness.

AB  - PURPOSE: Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) items are frequently used to assess psychological distress but no study to date has investigated the GHQ-30's potential for adaptive administration. In computerized adaptive testing (CAT) items are matched optimally to the targeted distress level of respondents instead of relying on fixed-length versions of instruments. We therefore calibrate GHQ-30 items and report a simulation study exploring the potential of this instrument for adaptive administration in a longitudinal setting. METHODS: GHQ-30 responses of 3445 participants with 2 completed assessments (baseline, 7-year follow-up) in the UK Health and Lifestyle Survey were calibrated using item response theory. Our simulation study evaluated the efficiency of CAT administration of the items, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with different estimators, item selection methods, and measurement precision criteria. RESULTS: To yield accurate distress measurements (marginal reliability at least 0.90) nearly all GHQ-30 items need to be administered to most survey respondents in general population samples. When lower accuracy is permissible (marginal reliability of 0.80), adaptive administration saves approximately 2/3 of the items. For longitudinal applications, change scores based on the complete set of GHQ-30 items correlate highly with change scores from adaptive administrations. CONCLUSIONS: The rationale for CAT-GHQ-30 is only supported when the required marginal reliability is lower than 0.9, which is most likely to be the case in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies assessing mean changes in populations. Precise measurement of psychological distress at the individual level can be achieved, but requires the deployment of all 30 items.

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between the total area marked on pain and numbness diagrams and psychosocial factors (depression, pain catastrophic thinking, and health anxiety). METHODS: A total of 155 patients marked painful and numb areas on separate hand diagrams. Patients also completed demographic, condition-related, and psychosocial (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression Computer Adaptive Test, and Short Health Anxiety Inventory) questionnaires. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to determine factors associated with total area marked on the pain and numbness diagrams. RESULTS: The total area marked on the pain diagram correlated with catastrophic thinking, symptoms of depression, and health anxiety. In multivariable analysis, catastrophic thinking was the sole predictor of marked pain area, accounting for 10% of variance in the hand pain diagram. The total area marked on the numbness diagram correlated with the interval between onset and visit, diagnosis, catastrophic thinking, and symptoms of depression. In multivariable analysis, the interval between onset and visit, a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, and catastrophic thinking were independently associated with total area marked on the hand numbness diagram. CONCLUSIONS: Catastrophic thinking was independently associated with larger pain and numbness areas on a hand diagram. This suggests that larger symptom markings on hand diagrams may indicate less effective coping strategies. Hand diagrams might be used as a basis for discussion of coping strategies and illness behavior in patients with upper extremity conditions. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients and surgeons can feel uncomfortable discussing coping strategies, psychological distress, and stressful circumstances. It has been suggested that patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) facilitate the discussion of factors associated with increased symptoms and disability. This study assessed the effect of providing feedback to patients regarding their coping strategy and illness behavior on patient satisfaction and patient-physician communication in orthopedic surgery. METHODS: In a prospective study, 136 orthopedic patients were randomly assigned to either receive feedback about the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference computer-adaptive test (CAT) prior to the visit with the hand surgeon or not. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction with the consultation and secondary outcomes involved patient-physician communication. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the influence of the feedback on patient satisfaction and communication. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between patients who received feedback and patients who did not (P = 0.70). Feedback was associated with more frequent discussion of coping strategies (P = 0.045) in bivariate analysis but was not independently associated: in multivariable analysis, only PROMIS Pain Interference CAT and age were identified as independent predictors (odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.0-1.1, P = 0.013, and OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.032, respectively). No factors were associated with discussion of stressors. Discussion of circumstances was independently associated with increased PROMIS Pain Interference CAT, marital status, and work status. CONCLUSION: We found that feedback regarding coping strategies and illness behavior using the PROMIS Pain Interference CAT did not affect patient satisfaction. Although feedback was associated with increased discussion of illness behavior in bivariate analysis, less effective coping strategies and personal factors (age, marital status, and work status) were more important factors.

AB  - The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was devised to facilitate assessment of patient self-reported health status, taking advantage of Item Response Theory. We aimed to assess measurement properties of the PROMIS Depression item bank and an 8-item static short form in a Spanish clinical sample. A three-month follow-up study of patients with active mood/anxiety symptoms (n = 218) was carried out. We assessed model unidimensionality (Confirmatory Item Factor Analysis), reliability (internal consistency and Item Information Curves), and validity (convergent-discriminant with correlations; known-groups with comparison of means and effect sizes; and criterion validity with Receiver operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis). We also assessed 3-month responsiveness to change (Cohen's effect sizes (d) in stable and recovered patients). The unidimensional model showed adequate fit (CFI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.08). Information Curves had reliabilities over 0.90 throughout most of the score continuum. As expected, we observed high correlations with external self-reported depression, and moderate with self-reported anxiety and clinical measures. The item bank showed an increasing severity gradient from no disorder (mean = 48, SE = 0.6) to depression with comorbid anxiety (mean = 55.8, SE = 0.4). PROMIS detected depression disorder with great accuracy according to the area under the curve (AUC = 0.89). Both formats, item bank and short form, were highly responsive to change in recovered patients (d > 0.7) and had small changes in stable patients (d < 0.2). The good metric properties of the Spanish PROMIS Depression measures provide further evidence of their adequacy for monitoring depression levels of patients in clinical settings. This double check of quality (within countries and populations) supports the ability of PROMIS measures for guaranteeing fair comparisons across languages and countries in specific clinical populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of an adaptive speech recognition protocol (NSRT((R))) that can be self-administered in non-clinical venues by listeners using internet-based software. DESIGN: All participants were given an audiological evaluation, including pure-tone testing, and responded to the NSRT administered in quiet and + 5 dB SNR listening conditions. The NSRT test materials are sentence-length utterances containing phonetic contrasts, primarily minimal pairs. STUDY SAMPLE: Subjects were 123 adults with normal hearing to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss (mean age = 55 years, SD = 23). RESULTS: Performance on the NSRT is strongly related to pure-tone thresholds. Linear regression analyses support the utility of the NSRT as a proxy for clinically-obtained hearing thresholds across the octave frequencies 0.5 to 8 kHz, primarily for individuals in the - 10 to 55 dB HL range. Other NSRT results are linked to analyses of phonetic errors and components of aural rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Among its numerous results, the NSRT yields quantitative predictions of frequency-specific hearing thresholds, provides insight into the phonetic errors that affect speech understanding in adults who suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, primarily in the - 10 to 55 dB HL range, and has implications for the design of individualized auditory training programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are diagnosed without the classic signs of renal or osseous complications. Vague and subjective symptoms have been attributed to PHPT but have been difficult to measure during the medical encounter. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) of the National Institutes of Health contains validated measures of physical and mental health that can be administered by the use of computer-adaptive testing (CAT). The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of PROMIS assessment in the clinical setting to measure changes in patient-reported health before and after parathyroidectomy. We hypothesized that patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT would report greater improvement in mental and physical health compared with control patients. METHODS: Adult PHPT patients scheduled for parathyroidectomy and control patients requiring diagnostic thyroid operation were enrolled prospectively during a 6-month period. Patients were administered clinically relevant PROMIS health domains via CAT at a preoperative visit and 3 weeks after operation. A change in score of 5 or greater for each PROMIS instrument was defined as clinically important. Statistical significance of pre/post-surgery changes in scores was determined using paired t tests. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with PHPT and 9 control patients completed the study. The mean number of PROMIS items answered during an assessment was 67 (range 51-121, SD 15.4). Median completion time was 8.2 minutes (range 3.4-38.4, SD 4.7). Clinically important improvement after parathyroidectomy in the PHPT group was greater than in the control group in 5 PROMIS domains. The score improvement experienced by PHPT patients was 8.8 in Fatigue, 6.7 in Sleep-Related Impairment, 5.0 in Anxiety, 7.0 in Applied Cognition, and 6.2 in Depression (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: PROMIS is an efficient clinical assessment platform for measuring patient-reported outcomes in PHPT via CAT. Several domains of physical and mental health in patients with PHPT show statistically and clinically important improvement after parathyroidectomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an item response theory (IRT)-calibrated spinal cord injury (SCI)-specific Positive Affect and Well-being (PAWB) item bank with flexible options for administration. DESIGN: Qualitative feedback from patient and provider focus groups was used to expand on the Neurological Disorders and Quality of Life (Neuro-QOL) positive affect & well-being item bank for use in SCI. New items were created and revised based on expert review and patient feedback and were then field tested. Analyses included confirmatory factor analysis, graded response IRT modeling and evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF). SETTING: We tested a 32-item pool at several rehabilitation centers across the United States, including the University of Michigan, Kessler Foundation, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the University of Washington, Craig Hospital and the James J. Peters/Bronx Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 717 individuals with SCI answered the PAWB questions. RESULTS: A unidimensional model was observed (Confirmatory Fit Index=0.947; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation=0.094) and measurement precision was good (reliability in theta of -2.9 to 1.2 is roughly equivalent to classical reliability of 0.95 or above). Twelve items were flagged for DIF, however, after examination of effect sizes, the DIF was determined to be negligible and would have little practical impact on score estimates. The final calibrated item bank resulted in 28 retained items CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the Spinal Cord Injury--Quality of Life PAWB bank represents a psychometrically robust measurement tool. Short form items are also suggested and a computer adaptive test is available.

DESIGN: Using a mixed-methods design, we developed and tested a Psychological Trauma item bank with patient and provider focus groups, cognitive interviews, and item response theory based analytic approaches, including tests of model fit, differential item functioning (DIF) and precision. SETTING: We tested a 31-item pool at several medical institutions across the United States, including the University of Michigan, Kessler Foundation, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the University of Washington, Craig Hospital and the James J. Peters/Bronx Veterans Administration hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 716 individuals with SCI completed the trauma items RESULTS: The 31 items fit a unidimensional model (CFI=0.952; RMSEA=0.061) and demonstrated good precision (theta range between 0.6 and 2.5). Nine items demonstrated negligible DIF with little impact on score estimates. The final calibrated item bank contains 19 items CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL Psychological Trauma item bank is a psychometrically robust measurement tool from which a short form and a computer adaptive test (CAT) version are available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a calibrated item bank and computer adaptive test to assess anxiety symptoms in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), transform scores to the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) metric, and create a statistical linkage with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, a widely used anxiety measure. DESIGN: Grounded-theory based qualitative item development methods; large-scale item calibration field testing; confirmatory factor analysis; graded response model item response theory analyses; statistical linking techniques to transform scores to a PROMIS metric; and linkage with the GAD-7. Setting Five SCI Model System centers and one Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in the United States. Participants Adults with traumatic SCI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spinal Cord Injury-Quality of Life (SCI-QOL) Anxiety Item Bank RESULTS: Seven hundred sixteen individuals with traumatic SCI completed 38 items assessing anxiety, 17 of which were PROMIS items. After 13 items (including 2 PROMIS items) were removed, factor analyses confirmed unidimensionality. Item response theory analyses were used to estimate slopes and thresholds for the final 25 items (15 from PROMIS). The observed Pearson correlation between the SCI-QOL Anxiety and GAD-7 scores was 0.67. CONCLUSIONS: The SCI-QOL Anxiety item bank demonstrates excellent psychometric properties and is available as a computer adaptive test or short form for research and clinical applications. SCI-QOL Anxiety scores have been transformed to the PROMIS metric and we provide a method to link SCI-QOL Anxiety scores with those of the GAD-7.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive, psychometrically sound, and conceptually grounded patient reported outcomes (PRO) measurement system for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Individual interviews (n=44) and focus groups (n=65 individuals with SCI and n=42 SCI clinicians) were used to select key domains for inclusion and to develop PRO items. Verbatim items from other cutting-edge measurement systems (i.e. PROMIS, Neuro-QOL) were included to facilitate linkage and cross-population comparison. Items were field tested in a large sample of individuals with traumatic SCI (n=877). Dimensionality was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis. Local item dependence and differential item functioning were assessed, and items were calibrated using the item response theory (IRT) graded response model. Finally, computer adaptive tests (CATs) and short forms were administered in a new sample (n=245) to assess test-retest reliability and stability. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES: A calibration sample of 877 individuals with traumatic SCI across five SCI Model Systems sites and one Department of Veterans Affairs medical center completed SCI-QOL items in interview format. RESULTS: We developed 14 unidimensional calibrated item banks and 3 calibrated scales across physical, emotional, and social health domains. When combined with the five Spinal Cord Injury--Functional Index physical function banks, the final SCI-QOL system consists of 22 IRT-calibrated item banks/scales. Item banks may be administered as CATs or short forms. Scales may be administered in a fixed-length format only. CONCLUSIONS: The SCI-QOL measurement system provides SCI researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive, relevant and psychometrically robust system for measurement of physical-medical, physical-functional, emotional, and social outcomes. All SCI-QOL instruments are freely available on Assessment CenterSM.

AB  - CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: The Spinal Cord Injury--Quality of Life (SCI-QOL) measurement system was developed to address the shortage of relevant and psychometrically sound patient reported outcome (PRO) measures available for clinical care and research in spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Using a computer adaptive testing (CAT) approach, the SCI-QOL builds on the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) initiative. This initial manuscript introduces the background and development of the SCI-QOL measurement system. Greater detail is presented in the additional manuscripts of this special issue. DESIGN: Classical and contemporary test development methodologies were employed. Qualitative input was obtained from individuals with SCI and clinicians through interviews, focus groups, and cognitive debriefing. Item pools were field tested in a multi-site sample (n=877) and calibrated using item response theory methods. Initial reliability and validity testing was performed in a new sample of individuals with traumatic SCI (n=245). SETTING: Five Model SCI System centers and one Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with traumatic SCI. INTERVENTIONS: n/a OUTCOME MEASURES: n/a RESULTS: The SCI-QOL consists of 19 item banks, including the SCI-Functional Index banks, and 3 fixed-length scales measuring physical, emotional, and social aspects of health-related QOL (HRQOL). CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL measurement system consists of psychometrically sound measures for individuals with SCI. The manuscripts in this special issue provide evidence of the reliability and initial validity of this measurement system. The SCI-QOL also links to other measures designed for a general medical population.

AB  - To confirm associations with a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each with only a small effect size, as hypothesized in the polygenic theory for schizophrenia, the International Schizophrenia Consortium (2009, Nature 460:748-752) proposed a polygenic risk score (PRS) test and demonstrated its effectiveness when applied to psychiatric disorders. The basic idea of the PRS test is to use a half of the sample to select and up-weight those more likely to be associated SNPs, and then use the other half of the sample to test for aggregated effects of the selected SNPs. Intrigued by the novelty and increasing use of the PRS test, we aimed to evaluate and improve its performance for GWAS data. First, by an analysis of the PRS test, we point out its connection with the Sum test [Chapman and Whittaker, Genet Epidemiol 32:560-566; Pan, Genet Epidemiol 33:497-507]; given the known advantages and disadvantages of the Sum test, this connection motivated the development of several other polygenic tests, some of which may be more powerful than the PRS test under certain situations. Second, more importantly, to overcome the low statistical efficiency of the data-splitting strategy as adopted in the PRS test, we reformulate and thus modify the PRS test, obtaining several adaptive tests, which are closely related to the adaptive sum of powered score (SPU) test studied in the context of rare variant analysis [Pan et al., 2014, Genetics 197:1081-1095]. We use both simulated data and a real GWAS dataset of alcohol dependence to show dramatically improved power of the new tests over the PRS test; due to its superior performance and simplicity, we recommend the whole sample-based adaptive SPU test for polygenic testing. We hope to raise the awareness of the limitations of the PRS test and potential power gain of the adaptive SPU test.

AB  - Vaccine benefit is usually two-folded: (i) prevent a disease or, failing that, (ii) diminish the severity of a disease. To assess vaccine effect, we propose two adaptive tests. The weighted two-part test is a combination of two statistics, one on disease incidence and one on disease severity. More weight is given to the statistic with the larger a priori effect size, and the weights are determined to maximize testing power. The randomized test applies to the scenario where the total number of infections is relatively small. It uses information on disease severity to bolster power while preserving disease incidence as the primary interest. Properties of the proposed tests are explored asymptotically and by numerical studies. Although motivated by vaccine studies, the proposed tests apply to any trials that involve both binary and continuous outcomes for evaluating treatment effect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the psychometric properties of the 23-item version of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-23) and to quantify their stability across 2 cultures/languages and 2 types of care-settings. METHODS: Rasch analysis of data from 1,000 patients with low back pain from primary care (UK and Denmark) and secondary care (Denmark). RESULTS: The RMDQ-23 is unidimensional if local item dependency issues are accommodated, but contains several misfitting or overdiscriminating items, some poor targeting of items, and the scoring of 4-5 items is differentially affected by common clinical characteristics (such as age, gender, pain intensity, pain duration and care setting), depending on the country. CONCLUSION: As similar results have been found for the RMDQ-24, we believe it is timely to reconsider whether: (i) the RMDQ should be reconstructed using an item-response theory-based approach that includes consideration of new items and response options; or (ii) the use of alternative questionnaires should be recommended, such as the Oswestry Disability Index, that have shown evidence of fitting the Rasch model; or (iii) a completely new condition-specific questionnaire should be developed, perhaps utilizing a computerized adaptive testing platform.

AB  - Utilization of patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) had been limited by the lack of psychometrically sound measures scored in real-time. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative developed a broad array of high-quality PRO measures. Towards reducing the number of items administered in measuring PROs, PROMIS employs Item Response Theory (IRT) and Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT). By only administering questions targeted to the subject's trait level, CAT has cut testing times in half(1). The IRT/CAT implementation in PROMIS is unidimensional in that there is a separate set of questions administered for each measured trait. However, there are often correlations among traits. Multidimensional IRT (MIRT) and multidimensional CAT (MCAT) provide items concerning several correlated traits, and should ameliorate patient burden. We developed an MIRT model using existing PROMIS item banks for depression and anxiety, developed MCAT software, and compared the efficiency of the MCAT approach to the unidimensional approach. Note: Research reported in this publication was supported in part by the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01LM011962.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of surveys is becoming popular in the health care industry for acquiring information useful to the accomplishment of several studies. Besides their exploitation on a large scale for conducting epidemiological studies, surveys are being increasingly carried out on a narrower perspective through the administration of questionnaires aimed at assessing the quality of life perceived by patients or their clinical status during mid- or long-term treatments. This is useful for managing resources or optimizing and individualizing treatments. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes Gquest, a platform for modeling, generating and administering questionnaires through mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. Gquest was motivated by the need of administering questionnaires during home treatments, albeit its applicability is rather general. The main requirement was to have a very simple, clean and easy to use platform able to support (a) physicians in the design and delivery of questionnaires and (b) outpatients in sending self-recorded outcomes to the clinical staff. METHODS: Gquest has two basic components. The first one is a model devised for representing questionnaires which is extremely flexible. It allows the generation of questions and answers of different types, supports adaptivity in the dialog with the user and enforces simple consistency rules for checking his input. The second component is an application able to run instances of those questionnaires. It downloads questionnaires over the air in terms of XML files from a server and stores them locally into the mobile repository. Questionnaires become then available to the user, who in our case is a patient or one of his relatives. The user can select which one to fill-in, according to his needs and/or the specific treatment protocol. The selected questionnaire may be filled-in all at once or be completed in subsequent steps over time since any input provided is persisted on a local database. Finally, when a questionnaire is closed all the answers are transparently synchronized to a server for further evaluation or statistical purposes. RESULTS: The platform has been exploited and tested in two medical domains where questionnaires have very different purposes; a quality of life pilot survey involving patients with atrial fibrillation within the EU-funded project MobiGuide, and an investigation of the users' needs during the requirements elicitation phase of a telemedicine project for the safe discharge of fragile patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gquest proved to be a suitable tool for dealing with a wide variety of question types and has been positively accepted by the patients enrolled in the pilot study.

AB  - Patient self-reported symptoms are of crucial importance to identify anxiety disorders, as well as to monitor their treatment in clinical practice and research. Thus, for evidence-based medicine, a precise, reliable, and valid (ie, "objective") assessment of the patient's reported "subjective" symptoms is warranted. There is a plethora of instruments available, which can provide psychometrically sound assessments of anxiety, but there are several limitations of current tools that need to be carefully considered for their successful use. Nevertheless, the empirical assessment of mental health status is not as accepted in medicine as is the assessment of biomarkers. One reason for this may be that different instruments assessing the same psychological construct use different scales. In this paper we present some new developments that promise to provide one common metric for the assessment of anxiety, to facilitate the general acceptance of mental health assessments in the future.

AB  - Depression and anxiety disorders are common conditions with significant morbidity. Many screening tools of varying length have been well validated for these conditions in the office-based setting. Novel instruments, including Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, may be promising tools in the future. The best evidence for cost-effectiveness currently is for screening of major depression linked with the collaborative care model for treatment. Data are not conclusive regarding comparative cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple conditions at once or for other conditions. This article reviews screening tools for depression and anxiety disorders in the ambulatory setting.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking behavior is influenced by social motivations such as the expected social benefits of smoking and the social cues that induce craving. This paper describes development of the PROMIS Social Motivations for Smoking item banks, which will serve to standardize assessment of these social motivations among daily and nondaily smokers. METHODS: Daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N =1,183) smokers completed an online survey. Item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and differential item functioning analyses were conducted to identify a unidimensional set of items for each group. Short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive tests (CATs) were evaluated as tools for more efficiently assessing this construct. RESULTS: A total of 15 items were included in the item banks (9 items common to daily and nondaily smokers, 3 unique to daily, 3 unique to nondaily). Scores based on full item banks are highly reliable (reliability = 0.90-0.91). Additionally, the item banks are strongly unidimensional and perform similarly across gender, age, and race/ethnicity groups. A fixed SF for use with both daily and nondaily smokers consists of 4 items (reliability = 0.80). Results from simulated CATs showed that, on average, fewer than 5 items are needed to assess this construct with adequate precision using the item banks. CONCLUSIONS: A new set of items has been identified for assessing the social motivations for smoking in a reliable, standardized manner for daily and nondaily smokers. In addition to using the full item banks, efficient assessment can be achieved by using SFs, employing CATs, or selecting items tailored to specific research or clinical purposes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The positive emotional and sensory expectancies of cigarette smoking include improved cognitive abilities, positive affective states, and pleasurable sensorimotor sensations. This paper describes development of Positive Emotional and Sensory Expectancies of Smoking item banks that will serve to standardize the assessment of this construct among daily and nondaily cigarette smokers. METHODS: Data came from daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N =1,183) smokers who completed an online survey. To identify a unidimensional set of items, we conducted item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and differential item functioning analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of fixed-item short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive tests (CATs) to efficiently assess the construct. RESULTS: Eighteen items were included in the item banks (15 common across daily and nondaily smokers, 1 unique to daily, 2 unique to nondaily). The item banks are strongly unidimensional, highly reliable (reliability = 0.95 for both), and perform similarly across gender, age, and race/ethnicity groups. A SF common to daily and nondaily smokers consists of 6 items (reliability = 0.86). Results from simulated CATs indicated that, on average, less than 8 items are needed to assess the construct with adequate precision using the item banks. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses identified a new set of items that can assess the positive emotional and sensory expectancies of smoking in a reliable and standardized manner. Considerable efficiency in assessing this construct can be achieved by using the item bank SF, employing computer adaptive tests, or selecting subsets of items tailored to specific research or clinical purposes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Smoking is a coping strategy for many smokers who then have difficulty finding new ways to cope with negative affect when they quit. This paper describes analyses conducted to develop and evaluate item banks for assessing the coping expectancies of smoking for daily and nondaily smokers. METHODS: Using data from a large sample of daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N = 1,183) smokers, we conducted a series of item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses (according to gender, age, and ethnicity) to arrive at a unidimensional set of items for daily and nondaily smokers. We also evaluated performance of short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive tests (CATs) for assessing coping expectancies of smoking. RESULTS: For both daily and nondaily smokers, the unidimensional Coping Expectancies item banks (21 items) are relatively DIF free and are highly reliable (0.96 and 0.97, respectively). A common 4-item SF for daily and nondaily smokers also showed good reliability (0.85). Adaptive tests required an average of 4.3 and 3.7 items for simulated daily and nondaily respondents, respectively, and achieved reliabilities of 0.91 for both when the maximum test length was 10 items. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides a new set of items that can be used to reliably assess coping expectancies of smoking, through a SF, CAT, or a tailored set selected for a specific research purpose.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The PROMIS Smoking Initiative has developed an assessment toolkit for measuring 6 domains of interest to cigarette smoking research: nicotine dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and sensory expectancies, health expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social motivations for smoking. The papers in this supplement describe the methods used to develop these item banks, their psychometric properties, and the preliminary evidence for their validity. This commentary is meant to provide background information for the material in this supplement. METHODS: After discussing the use of item response theory in behavioral measurement, I will briefly review the initial developmental steps for the smoking assessment toolkit. Finally, I will describe the contents of this supplement and provide some closing remarks. RESULTS: Psychometric evidence strongly supports the utility of the toolkit of item banks, short forms (SFs), and computer adaptive tests (CATs). The item banks for daily smokers produce scores with reliability estimates above 0.90 for a wide range of each cigarette smoking domain continuum, and SF and CAT administrations also achieve high reliability (generally greater than 0.85) using very few items (4-7 items for most banks). Performance of the banks for nondaily smokers is similar. Preliminary evidence supports the concurrent and the discriminant validity of the bank domains. CONCLUSIONS: The new smoking assessment toolkit has attractive measurement features that are likely to benefit smoking research as researchers begin to utilize this resource. Information about the toolkit and access to the assessments is available at the project Web site (http://www.rand.org/health/projects/promis-smoking-initiative.html) and can also be accessed via the PROMIS Assessment Center (www.assessmentcenter.net).

AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), structured in Itens Banks, provides a new tool for evaluating results that apply to various chronic diseases through advanced statistical techniques (TRI) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The aim of this study was to culturally adapt the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of PROMIS to the Portuguese language. The process followed the recommendations of PROMIS through the advanced translation, reconciliation, back-translation, FACIT review, independent review, finalization, pre-test, and incorporation of the results from the pre-test. The translated version was pre-tested in ten patients, and items 3, 46, and 53 of the Bank of Anxiety and item 46 of the bank of Depression had to be changed. Changes affected equivalence of meaning, and the final version was consistent with the Brazilian population's linguistic and cultural skills. In conclusion, for the Brazilian population the translated version proved semantically and conceptually equivalent to the original.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Missing data are unavoidable in clinical research. Older age, female gender, and fewer years of education are risk factors for missing items in a questionnaire. This study assessed the differences between patients with complete and incomplete Disabilities of the Arms, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires in terms of demographics and psychological factors. METHODS: We analyzed a convenience sample of 1,204 patients enrolled in eight prospective studies. The DASH and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were completed by all patients. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, and an ordinal pain scale were completed by 745, 493, 545, and 391 patients, respectively. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to determine risk factors for incomplete (one or more unanswered question) or invalid (more than three unanswered questions) DASH questionnaires. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients did not complete all questions on the DASH. Patients with an incomplete DASH were older, had fewer years of education, and had higher levels of catastrophic thinking, depression, and pain anxiety. Age and catastrophic thinking were retained in the best logistic regression models of predictors of both incomplete and invalid DASH questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that patients who complete disability questionnaires are different from patients who do not may affect the interpretation of clinical research. Computer adaptive testing may be preferable to avoid incomplete questionnaires. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are important for clinical research and care, yet administering and scoring the questionnaires requires considerable effort and time. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) could considerably reduce administrative obstacles and lessen survey burden for participants. OBJECTIVE: Assess the feasibility and validity of PROMIS, compared to commonly-used legacy measures for multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 133 participants with confirmed MS completed legacy surveys and PROMIS Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) for depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue and physical function. We conducted a multi-trait, multi-method analysis and verified results with confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The correlations between PROMIS and the corresponding legacy measures were large (0.67 to 0.87). The multi-trait, multi-method criteria were generally well met, providing good evidence of the validity of PROMIS measures. PROMIS surveys asked fewer questions and required substantially less time to complete than the legacy scales. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence of the construct validity of PROMIS for use with MS patients. Several aspects of the PROMIS CATs made them an important resource, including: (a) less time was required to complete them; (b) missing data was reduced; and (c) the automatic scoring referenced the general population. Our findings support the use of PROMIS in MS research and may have broader implications for clinical care, as well.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS) is a common foot disorder; however, there is limited clinical evidence on which to base treatment. Repeated clinical observations indicating heel pain during heel rise and minisquat on the affected leg, involving activation of posterior calf muscles, formed the basis of this study. OBJECTIVE: To compare deep massage therapy to posterior calf muscles and neural mobilization with a self-stretch exercise program (DMS) to a common treatment protocol of ultrasound therapy to the painful heel area with the same self-stretch exercises (USS). METHODS: Patients with PHPS were assigned to a program of 8 treatments over a period of 4-6 weeks in a single-blind randomized clinical trial. Functional status (FS) at admission and discharge from therapy as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included in the trial (mean age 53, standard deviation (SD) 13, range 25-86, 57% women), 36 received DMS treatment and 33 with USS. The overall group-by-time interaction for the mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was found statistically significant (p=0.034), with a change of (mean (confidence interval, CI)) 15 (9-21) and 6 (1-11) FS points for the DMS and USS groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Data indicated that both treatment protocols resulted in an overall short-term improvement, however, DMS treatment was significantly more effective in treating PHPS than USS treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe whether negative affect and sleep impairment are associated with the clinical effect of epidural steroid injections (ESIs) for low back pain. DESIGN: Observational study; patients were evaluated before ESI and 1 and 3 months after ESI. SETTING: Spine center and related treatment sites. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=158) seeking treatment for low back pain with or without radiculopathy. INTERVENTION: ESI for low back pain with or without radiculopathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the dependent (global pain severity for back and leg pain, pain behavior, pain interference) and independent variables (depression, sleep disturbance, and covariates of back pain response) with the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and legacy measures. Outcome was assessed cross-sectionally using multiple regression and longitudinally with path analysis. RESULTS: After 1 month, sleep disturbance was the only predictor for the global ratings of improvement in back pain (R(2)=16.8%) and leg pain (R(2)=11.4%). The proportions of variance explained by sleep disturbance and negative affect for all dependent variables were greater at 3 months than 1 month. Mediation analysis was significant for negative affect for the 3-month outcomes on PROMIS pain behavior (beta=.87, P<.01) and pain interference (beta=.37, P<.01). There was no evidence of mediation by sleep disturbance for any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect and sleep disturbance are associated with worse outcomes after ESI. Further research is needed to determine if treatment of negative affect and sleep disturbance prior to or concurrently with ESI will improve outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of symptom intensity, mood, and comorbidities on patient-clinician agreement and the consistency of responses to functional patient-reported outcomes (PROs). DESIGN: Two data sources were used. The first, a cross-sectional database of patients with breast cancer who completed functional PROs and were administered the FIM, was used to examine whether average pain intensity (as measured with an 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) and Rand Mental Health inventory scores differed among those rating their functional independence as different than clinicians. The second, a longitudinal database of 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer who completed the Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM PAC CAT) with differences between their expected and actual responses as reflected in their AM PAC CAT SEs. SETTING: Two tertiary medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Data source #1, 163 women with stage IV breast cancer; data source #2, 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data source #1, FIM, pain NRS, Older Americans Resource Study activities of daily living subscale, Physical Function-10, Mental Health Inventory-17. Data source #2, AM PAC CAT and NRS symptom ratings. RESULTS: Pain intensity was significantly higher when clinicians and patients disagreed regarding a patient's independence in the ability to transfer (NRS pain severity, 3.78 vs 2.40; P=.014), groom (3.71 vs 2.36, P=.009), bathe (3.76 vs 2.40, P=.016), and dress (3.09 vs 2.44, P=.034). The magnitude of AM PAC CAT SEs was significantly associated with the severity of participants' pain, dyspnea, and fatigue, as well as the presence of musculoskeletal disorders and coronary artery disease. Neither mood nor emotional distress was associated with clinician-patient agreement or AM PAC CAT SE. CONCLUSIONS: Pain intensity is associated with disagreement between patients and clinicians about the patient's level of functioning. Moreover, physical symptoms (pain, dyspnea, fatigue) as well as specific medical comorbidities (musculoskeletal disorders, coronary artery disease), but not mood, are associated with inconsistency in patients' assessment of their functional abilities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article describes the procedures used in the PROMIS Smoking Initiative for the development and evaluation of item banks, short forms (SFs), and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for the assessment of 6 constructs related to cigarette smoking: nicotine dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and sensory expectancies, health expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social motivations for smoking. METHODS: Analyses were conducted using response data from a large national sample of smokers. Items related to each construct were subjected to extensive item factor analyses and evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF). Final item banks were calibrated, and SF assessments were developed for each construct. The performance of the SFs and the potential use of the item banks for CAT administration were examined through simulation study. RESULTS: Item selection based on dimensionality assessment and DIF analyses produced item banks that were essentially unidimensional in structure and free of bias. Simulation studies demonstrated that the constructs could be accurately measured with a relatively small number of carefully selected items, either through fixed SFs or CAT-based assessment. Illustrative results are presented, and subsequent articles provide detailed discussion of each item bank in turn. CONCLUSIONS: The development of the PROMIS smoking item banks provides researchers with new tools for measuring smoking-related constructs. The use of the calibrated item banks and suggested SF assessments will enhance the quality of score estimates, thus advancing smoking research. Moreover, the methods used in the current study, including innovative approaches to item selection and SF construction, may have general relevance to item bank development and evaluation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computer adaptive tests (CATs) offer a flexible, test fair, and economic opportunity for accurate measurement of anxiety in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The objective of this study was to develop and calibrate an item bank [anxiety item bank for cardiovascular patients (AIB-cardio)] as a prerequisite for an anxiety-CAT in CVD patients. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: After pretesting for relevance and comprehension, a pool of 155 anxiety items was answered on a five-point Likert scale. Sample consisted of 715 CVD patients, who were recruited in 14 German cardiac rehabilitation centers. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Mokken analysis, and Rasch analysis were conducted. RESULTS: The results of CFA and Mokken analysis confirmed one factor structure and double monotonicity. In Rasch analysis, merging response categories and removing items with misfit, differential item functioning or local response dependency reduced the AIB-cardio to 37 items. The AIB-cardio fitted to the Rasch model with a nonsignificant item-trait interaction (chi-square, 133.89; degrees of freedom, 111; P = 0.07). Person separation reliability was 0.85, and unidimensionality could be verified. CONCLUSION: The calibrated, unidimensional AIB-cardio provides the basis for a CAT to assess anxiety in rehabilitation patients with CVD with good psychometric properties. Further testing in other cardiovascular patients is needed to increase generalizability.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a broad set of claimant-reported items to assess behavioral health functioning relevant to the Social Security disability determination processes, and to evaluate the underlying structure of behavioral health functioning for use in development of a new functional assessment instrument. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Item pools of behavioral health functioning were developed, refined, and field tested in a sample of persons applying for Social Security disability benefits (N=1015) who reported difficulties working because of mental or both mental and physical conditions. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Social Security Administration Behavioral Health (SSA-BH) measurement instrument. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) specified that a 4-factor model (self-efficacy, mood and emotions, behavioral control, social interactions) had the optimal fit with the data and was also consistent with our hypothesized conceptual framework for characterizing behavioral health functioning. When the items within each of the 4 scales were tested in CFA, the fit statistics indicated adequate support for characterizing behavioral health as a unidimensional construct along these 4 distinct scales of function. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents a significant advance both conceptually and psychometrically in assessment methodologies for work-related behavioral health. The measurement of behavioral health functioning relevant to the context of work requires the assessment of multiple dimensions of behavioral health functioning. Specifically, we identified a 4-factor model solution that represented key domains of work-related behavioral health functioning. These results guided the development and scale formation of a new SSA-BH instrument.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use item response theory (IRT) data simulations to construct and perform initial psychometric testing of a newly developed instrument, the Social Security Administration Behavioral Health Function (SSA-BH) instrument, that aims to assess behavioral health functioning relevant to the context of work. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey followed by IRT calibration data simulations. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Sample of individuals applying for Social Security Administration disability benefits: claimants (n=1015) and a normative comparative sample of U.S. adults (n=1000). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: SSA-BH measurement instrument. RESULTS: IRT analyses supported the unidimensionality of 4 SSA-BH scales: mood and emotions (35 items), self-efficacy (23 items), social interactions (6 items), and behavioral control (15 items). All SSA-BH scales demonstrated strong psychometric properties including reliability, accuracy, and breadth of coverage. High correlations of the simulated 5- or 10-item computer adaptive tests with the full item bank indicated robust ability of the computer adaptive testing approach to comprehensively characterize behavioral health function along 4 distinct dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Initial testing and evaluation of the SSA-BH instrument demonstrated good accuracy, reliability, and content coverage along all 4 scales. Behavioral function profiles of Social Security Administration claimants were generated and compared with age- and sex-matched norms along 4 scales: mood and emotions, behavioral control, social interactions, and self-efficacy. Using the computer adaptive test-based approach offers the ability to collect standardized, comprehensive functional information about claimants in an efficient way, which may prove useful in the context of the Social Security Administration's work disability programs.

AB  - The American College of Surgeons (ACoS) Commission on Cancer (CoC) has advanced a new patient-centered accreditation standard requiring programs to implement psychosocial distress screening and referral for psychosocial care. The field of psychosocial oncology has advocated for routine distress screening as an integral component of quality cancer care since the NCCN Distress Management Panel first recommended this practice in 1999. Accreditation standards have a significant impact on practice patterns and quality of care. The new ACoS CoC Psychosocial Distress Screening Standard provides a unique opportunity to integrate the science of psychosocial care into clinical practice. National organizations, including the American Psychosocial Oncology Society, the Association of Oncology Social Work, the Cancer Support Community, and LIVESTRONG, can offer valuable guidance and resources. This article reviews ACoS CoC requirements, highlighting key research findings and providing practical considerations to guide programs with implementation. Although screening for distress encompasses many domains, this article reviews the evidence linking depression-one aspect of distress-and cancer outcomes to highlight the profound influence psychosocial care delivery can have on promoting medical outcomes and quality cancer survivorship. The authors describe distress screening program accomplishments at Northwestern University, including the electronic administration of NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive testing item banks. Electronic medical record integration facilitates real-time scoring, interpretation, provider notification, and triage for psychosocial care. Roughly one-third of patients have requested assistance with psychosocial needs. As ACoS CoC programs implement psychosocial distress screening and management, the emerging field of implementation science can guide future clinical program developments and research priorities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Computer Adaptive Test version of the Community Reintegration of Injured Service Members measure (CRIS-CAT) consists of three scales measuring Extent of, Perceived Limitations in, and Satisfaction with community integration. The CRIS-CAT was developed using item response theory methods. The purposes of this study were to assess the reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive validity and respondent burden of the CRIS-CAT.The CRIS-CAT was developed using item response theory methods. The purposes of this study were to assess the reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive validity and respondent burden of the CRIS-CAT. METHODS: This was a three-part study that included a 1) a cross-sectional field study of 517 homeless, employed, and Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans; who completed all items in the CRIS item set, 2) a cohort study with one year follow-up study of 135 OEF/OIF Veterans, and 3) a 50-person study of CRIS-CAT administration. Conditional reliability of simulated CAT scores was calculated from the field study data, and concurrent validity and known group validity were examined using Pearson product correlations and ANOVAs. Data from the cohort were used to examine the ability of the CRIS-CAT to predict key one year outcomes. Data from the CRIS-CAT administration study were used to calculate ICC (2,1) minimum detectable change (MDC), and average number of items used during CAT administration. RESULTS: Reliability scores for all scales were above 0.75, but decreased at both ends of the score continuum. CRIS-CAT scores were correlated with concurrent validity indicators and differed significantly between the three Veteran groups (P < .001). The odds of having any Emergency Room visits were reduced for Veterans with better CRIS-CAT scores (Extent, Perceived Satisfaction respectively: OR = 0.94, 0.93, 0.95; P < .05). CRIS-CAT scores were predictive of SF-12 physical and mental health related quality of life scores at the 1 year follow-up. Scales had ICCs >0.9. MDCs were 5.9, 6.2, and 3.6, respectively for Extent, Perceived and Satisfaction subscales. Number of items (mn, SD) administered at Visit 1 were 14.6 (3.8) 10.9 (2.7) and 10.4 (1.7) respectively for Extent, Perceived and Satisfaction subscales. CONCLUSION: The CRIS-CAT demonstrated sound measurement properties including reliability, construct, known group and predictive validity, and it was administered with minimal respondent burden. These findings support the use of this measure in assessing community reintegration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of elevated fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of fear-avoidance on recovery of functional status during rehabilitation for people with shoulder impairments. DESIGN: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted. METHODS: Data were collected from 3,362 people with musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder receiving rehabilitation. At intake and discharge, upper-extremity function was measured using the shoulder Computerized Adaptive Test. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale. Completion rate at discharge was 57% for function and 47% for pain intensity. A single-item screen was used to classify patients into groups with low versus elevated fear-avoidance beliefs at intake. A general linear model (GLM) was used to describe how change in function is affected by fear avoidance in 8 disease categories. This study also accounted for within-clinic correlation and controlled for other important predictors of functional change in functional status, including various demographic and health-related variables. The parameters of the GLM and their standard errors were estimated with the weighted generalized estimating equations method. RESULTS: Functional change was predicted by the interaction between fear and disease categories. On further examination of 8 disease categories using GLM adjusted for other confounders, improvement in function was greater for the low fear group than for the elevated fear group among people with muscle, tendon, and soft tissue disorders (Delta=1.37, P<.01) and those with osteopathies, chondropathies, and acquired musculoskeletal deformities (Delta=5.52, P<.02). These differences were below the minimal detectable change. Limitations Information was not available on whether therapists used information on level of fear to implement treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status varies among specific shoulder impairments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a National Institutes of Health initiative to develop item banks measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and to create and make available a computerized adaptive testing system (CAT) that allows for efficient and precise assessment of PROs in clinical research and practice. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This paper provides an overview of PROMIS and its application to mental health research. METHODS: The PROMIS methodology for item bank development and testing is described, with a focus on the implications of this work for mental health research. RESULTS: Utilizing qualitative item review and state-of-the-art applications of item response theory (IRT), PROMIS investigators have developed, tested, and released item banks measuring physical, mental, and social health components. Ongoing efforts continue to add new item banks and further validate existing banks. DISCUSSION: PROMIS provides item banks measuring several domains of interest to mental health researchers including emotional distress, social function, and sleep. PROMIS methodology also provides a rigorous standard for the development of new mental health measures. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION: Web-based CAT or administration of short forms derived from PROMIS item banks provide efficient and precise dimensional estimates of clinical outcomes that can be utilized to monitor patient progress and assess quality improvement. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Use of the dimensional PROMIS metrics (and co-calibration of the PROMIS item banks with existing PROs) will allow comparisons of mental health and related health outcomes across disorders and studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) there is a high demand for short assessments. Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a promising method for efficient assessment. In this article, the efficiency of a CAT version of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, - Anhedonic Depression scale (MASQ-AD) for use in ROM was scrutinized in a simulation study. METHODS: The responses of a large sample of patients (N = 3,597) obtained through ROM were used. The psychometric evaluation showed that the items met the requirements for CAT. In the simulations, CATs with several measurement precision requirements were run on the item responses as if they had been collected adaptively. RESULTS: CATs employing only a small number of items gave results which, both in terms of depression measurement and criterion validity, were only marginally different from the results of a full MASQ-AD assessment. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that CAT improved the efficiency of the MASQ-AD questionnaire very much. The strengths and limitations of the application of CAT in ROM are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Past research has found youth with disabilities to experience poor psychosocial outcomes, but little is known about factors related to psychosocial health among youth with spinal cord injury (SCI). OBJECTIVE: To describe psychosocial health among youth with SCI, examine relationships between psychosocial outcomes and demographic and injury-related factors, and examine relationships between aspects of psychosocial health. Youth activity, participation, quality of life (QOL), coping, anxiety and depression, and caregiver mental health were included. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a prospective study of 420 youth with SCI ages 1-18 and their primary caregivers. Activity data were also presented from a study developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) platform with 226 youth with SCI ages 8-21. RESULTS: Although relationships varied by factor, youth outcomes were related to youth age, sex, age at injury/injury duration, and level/extent of injury. Caregiver mental health related to child age and age at injury. Further, relationships were uncovered between aspects of psychosocial health: aspects of youth mental health were related to youth participation and QOL, youth coping was related to youth mental health, participation, and QOL, and caregiver mental health was related to child mental health and QOL. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial outcomes relate to each other and vary by child and injury-related factors and should be understood in a comprehensive, developmental context. Identifying best measures of activity and psychosocial functioning among youth with SCI and understanding factors related to their psychosocial health is critical to improving outcomes for the pediatric-onset SCI population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a prototype dyspnea computer adaptive test (CAT). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Two outpatient medical facilities. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of adults (N=292) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We developed a modified and expanded item bank and CAT for the Dyspnea Management Questionnaire (DMQ), an outcome measure consisting of 4 dyspnea dimensions: dyspnea intensity, dyspnea anxiety, activity avoidance, and activity self-efficacy. RESULTS: Factor analyses supported a 4-dimensional model underlying the 71 DMQ items. The DMQ item bank achieved acceptable Rasch model fit statistics, good measurement breadth with minimal floor and ceiling effects, and evidence of high internal consistency reliability (alpha=.92-.98). With the use of CAT simulation analyses, the DMQ-CAT showed high measurement accuracy compared with the total item pool (r=.83-.97, P<.0001) and evidence of good to excellent concurrent validity (r=-.61 to -.80, P<.0001). All DMQ-CAT domains showed evidence for known-groups validity (P</=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The DMQ-CAT reliably and validly captured 4 distinct dyspnea domains. Multidimensional dyspnea assessment in COPD is needed to better measure the effectiveness of pharmacologic, pulmonary rehabilitation, and psychosocial interventions in not only alleviating the somatic sensation of dyspnea but also reducing dysfunctional emotions, cognitions, and behaviors associated with dyspnea, especially for anxious patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients have an impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which is usually analysed using static paper-pencil questionnaires. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computerised adaptive testing (CAT) are flexible, freely available, noncopyrighted, HRQOL instruments with US-based norms across 11 domains. CAT presents five to seven questions/domain depending on the patient's response, from large validated question banks. This provides brevity and precision equivalent to the entire question bank. AIM: To evaluate PROMIS CAT tools against 'legacy instruments' for cirrhotics and their informal caregivers. METHODS: A total of 200 subjects: 100 cirrhotics (70 men, 53% decompensated) and 100 caregivers were administered the PROMIS and legacy instruments [Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Beck depression/anxiety inventories, Pittsburgh Sleep-Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS)] concurrently. Both legacy and PROMIS results for patients were compared with caregivers and US norms. These were also compared between compensated and decompensated patients. Preference for SIP or PROMIS was inquired of a selected group (n = 70, 50% patients). Test - retest reliability was assessed in another group of 20 patients. RESULTS: Patients had significant impairment on all PROMIS domains apart from anger and anxiety compared with caregivers and US norms (P < 0.02 to <0.0001). Decompensated patients had significantly worse sleep, pain, social and physical function scores compared with compensated ones, similar to legacy instruments. There was a statistically significant correlation between PROMIS and their corresponding legacy instruments. The majority (71%) preferred PROMIS over SIP. PROMIS tools had significant test - retest reliability (ICC range 0.759-0.985) when administered 12 +/- 6 days apart. CONCLUSION: PROMIS computerised adaptive testing tools had significant concurrent and discriminant validity, test - retest reliability and subject preference for assessing HRQOL in cirrhotic patients.

AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population.

CY  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Questionnaires used by health services to identify children with psychosocial problems are often rather short. The psychometric properties of such short questionnaires are mostly less than needed for an accurate distinction between children with and without problems. We aimed to assess whether a short Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) can overcome the weaknesses of short written questionnaires when identifying children with psychosocial problems. METHOD: We used a Dutch national data set obtained from parents of children invited for a routine health examination by Preventive Child Healthcare with 205 items on behavioral and emotional problems (n = 2,041, response 84%). In a random subsample we determined which items met the requirements of an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to a sufficient degree. Using those items, item parameters necessary for a CAT were calculated and a cut-off point was defined. In the remaining subsample we determined the validity and efficiency of a Computerized Adaptive Test using simulation techniques, with current treatment status and a clinical score on the Total Problem Scale (TPS) of the Child Behavior Checklist as criteria. RESULTS: Out of 205 items available 190 sufficiently met the criteria of the underlying IRT model. For 90% of the children a score above or below cut-off point could be determined with 95% accuracy. The mean number of items needed to achieve this was 12. Sensitivity and specificity with the TPS as a criterion were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively. CONCLUSION: An IRT-based CAT is a very promising option for the identification of psychosocial problems in children, as it can lead to an efficient, yet high-quality identification. The results of our simulation study need to be replicated in a real-life administration of this CAT.

AB  - PURPOSE: Considerable research has demonstrated the negative psychosocial impact of cancer. Recent work has highlighted positive psychosocial outcomes. Research is now needed to evaluate the relationship between negative and positive impacts. This paper reports the development and validation of a measurement model capturing positive and negative psychosocial illness impacts. METHODS: The sample included 754 cancer patients on- or post-treatment. Item development was informed by literature review, expert input patient interviews and the results of a pilot study of 205 cancer patients, resulting in 43 positive and 46 negative items. Factor analyses were used to evaluate the dimensionality of the item pools. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine relationships between psychosocial illness impact and other variables. RESULTS: Unidimensionality was demonstrated within but not across negative and positive impact items. ANOVA results showed differential relationships between negative and positive impacts, respectively, and patient sociodemographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Positive and negative psychosocial illness impacts are best conceptualized and measured as two independent factors. Computerized adaptive tests and short-form measures developed from this comprehensive psychosocial illness impact item bank may benefit future research and clinical applications.

AB  - People with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy are likely to experience enhanced social and emotional strain. Critically, those with both vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and psychosocial problems may have significantly reduced levels of functioning compared with psychologically healthy counterparts. This can cause inadequate compliance, increased strain on family functioning, worse diabetes control, increased progression of diabetic retinopathy and, consequently, further psychosocial stress resulting in a number of concerning implications for disease management, clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. However, the emotional and social health consequences of diabetic retinopathy have not yet been systematically explored. This information is crucial as it allows for a targeted approach to treatment and prevention and avoidance of the potentially detrimental implications described above. Therefore, this paper reviews the current qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and identifies directions for future research. Key search terms were applied to the electronic databases Pubmed, ISI Web of Science and Embase and the bibliographies of relevant papers were systematically reviewed for additional references. Overall, the evidence suggests that diabetic retinopathy and associated vision loss have several debilitating effects, including disruption of family functioning, relationships and roles; increased social isolation and dependence; and deterioration of work prospects resulting in increased financial strain. Adverse emotional responses include fear, anxiety, vulnerability, guilt, loss of confidence, anger, stress and self-perception issues. However, the research to date is largely qualitative in nature, with most quantitative studies being small, cross-sectional and somewhat outdated. Similarly, the outcome measures used in many studies to date are suboptimal in terms of content and validity. Therefore, this review identifies the need for improved outcome measures to provide valid, meaningful measurement of the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and discusses potential directions for future research such as item banking and computer adaptive testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Dyspnea Management Questionnaire (DMQ) is a measure of the psychosocial and behavioral responses to dyspnea for adults with COPD. The research objectives were to evaluate the reliability and validity of an expanded DMQ item pool, as a preliminary step for developing a computer adaptive test. METHODS: The original 66 items of the DMQ were used for the analyses. The sample included 63 women and 44 men with COPD (n = 107) recruited from two urban medical centers. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the factor structure of the DMQ and its underlying cognitive-behavioral theoretical base. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and breadth of coverage of the expanded DMQ item bank were also evaluated. RESULTS: Five distinct dyspnea domains were confirmed using 56 original items of the DMQ: dyspnea intensity, dyspnea anxiety, activity avoidance, activity self-efficacy, and strategy satisfaction. Overall, the breadth of items was excellent with a good match between sample scores and item difficulty. The DMQ-56 showed good internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.85-to 0.96) and good preliminary test-retest reliability over a 3-week interval (ICC = 0.69-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The DMQ demonstrated acceptable levels of reliability and validity for measuring multidimensional dyspnea outcomes after medical, psychological, and behavioral interventions for adults with COPD.

AB  - Item response theory (IRT) and related latent variable models represent modern psychometric theory, the successor to classical test theory in psychological assessment. Although IRT has become prevalent in the measurement of ability and achievement, its contributions to clinical domains have been less extensive. Applications of IRT to clinical assessment are reviewed to appraise its current and potential value. Benefits of IRT include comprehensive analyses and reduction of measurement error, creation of computer adaptive tests, meaningful scaling of latent variables, objective calibration and equating, evaluation of test and item bias, greater accuracy in the assessment of change due to therapeutic intervention, and evaluation of model and person fit. The theory may soon reinvent the manner in which tests are selected, developed, and scored. Although challenges remain to the widespread implementation of IRT, its application to clinical assessment holds great promise. Recommendations for research, test development, and clinical practice are provided.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. METHODS: Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. RESULTS: On average, patients took about 1.5 minutes (SD <2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal clinically important improvement. LIMITATIONS: Because this study was a secondary analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future studies would benefit from more complete data. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for measuring health status in knee osteoarthritis. METHOD: Three hundred and fifty-one patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) answered 118 questions from a range of widely used questionnaires. Three dimensions relevant to knee OA were identified by expert opinion as 'pain, mental and emotional status'; 'self-care and household activities' and 'mobility and social activities'. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the relationship between the items and their dimensions. After CFA, these dimensions were subjected to Rasch analysis to calibrate the items onto an interval scale. A CAT was developed for each dimension, and the results checked against simulated applications from 10,000 simulees. RESULTS: After CFA and Rasch analysis, 14, 22 and 23 items remained in the first, second and third dimensions, respectively. Items were mostly free of differential item functioning for age, gender and duration of disease. Reliability exceeded 0.87 for each dimension. The health status levels generated using item banks and those obtained from the simulated CAT application were highly correlated (i.e. >0.91 for each dimension). On average, 8, 10 and 10 items were used to estimate the health status levels using the CAT for the first, second and third dimensions respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination approach of CFA and Rasch analysis, this study has shown that it is possible to calibrate items onto a single metric in a way that can be used to provide the basis of a CAT application.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the presence and impact of differential item functioning (DIF) in a set of knee-specific functional status (FS) items administered using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) among English (United States) and Hebrew (Israel) speaking patients receiving therapy for knee impairments. DIF occurs in an item if probabilities of endorsing responses differ across groups after controlling for the FS measured. METHODS: We analyzed data from 28,320 patients (14,160 U.S., 14,160 Israel) who completed the knee-specific CAT. Items were assessed for DIF by gender, age, symptom acuity, surgical history, exercise history, and language spoken using a hybrid technique that combines multiple ordinal logistic regression and item response theory FS estimates. RESULTS: Several items had non-uniform DIF for covariates including language, but unadjusted and DIF-adjusted functional status estimates were in strong concordance [ICC(2,1) values >/=0.97], and differences between unadjusted and adjusted FS scores represented <0.4% of the unadjusted FS standard deviation. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant DIF was identified in some items but represented negligible clinical impact. Results suggested no need to adjust items for DIF when assessing FS outcomes across groups of patients with knee impairments who answer the knee CAT items in English in the United States or Hebrew in Israel. These findings suggest negligible differences in cultural perceptions between English and Hebrew wording of these knee-specific CAT FS items.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to develop a functional outcome instrument for hip and knee osteoarthritis research (OA-FUNCTION-CAT) using item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive test (CAT) methods and to assess its psychometric performance compared to the current standard in the field. METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature review, focus groups, and cognitive testing to guide the construction of an item bank consisting of 125 functional activities commonly affected by hip and knee osteoarthritis. We recruited a convenience sample of 328 adults with confirmed hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Subjects reported their degree of functional difficulty and functional pain in performing each activity in the item bank and completed the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to assess scale uni-dimensionality, and IRT methods were used to calibrate the items and examine the fit of the data. We assessed the performance of OA-FUNCTION-CATs of different lengths relative to the full item bank and WOMAC using CAT simulation analyses. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed distinct functional difficulty and functional pain domains. Descriptive statistics for scores from 5-, 10-, and 15-item CATs were similar to those for the full item bank. The 10-item OA-FUNCTION-CAT scales demonstrated a high degree of accuracy compared with the item bank (r = 0.96 and 0.89, respectively). Compared to the WOMAC, both scales covered a broader score range and demonstrated a higher degree of precision at the ceiling and reliability across the range of scores. CONCLUSIONS: The OA-FUNCTION-CAT provided superior reliability throughout the score range and improved breadth and precision at the ceiling compared with the WOMAC. Further research is needed to assess whether these improvements carry over into superior ability to measure change.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a prototype measure (OA-DISABILITY-CAT) for osteoarthritis research using item response theory (IRT) and computer-adaptive test (CAT) methodologies. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We constructed an item bank consisting of 33 activities commonly affected by lower extremity (LE) osteoarthritis. A sample of 323 adults with LE osteoarthritis reported their degree of limitation in performing everyday activities, and completed the Health Assessment Questionnaire-II (HAQ-II). We used confirmatory factor analyses to assess scale unidimensionality and IRT methods to calibrate the items and examine the fit of the data. Using CAT simulation analyses, we examined the performance of OA-DISABILITY-CATs of different lengths compared with the full-item bank and the HAQ-II. RESULTS: One distinct disability domain was identified. The 10-item OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated a high degree of accuracy compared with the full-item bank (r=0.99). The item bank and the HAQ-II scales covered a similar estimated scoring range. In terms of reliability, 95% of OA-DISABILITY reliability estimates were over 0.83 vs. 0.60 for the HAQ-II. Except at the highest scores, the 10-item OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated superior precision to the HAQ-II. CONCLUSION: The prototype OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated promising measurement properties compared with the HAQ-II, and is recommended for use in LE osteoarthritis research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the Computerized Adaptive Test to measure anxiety (A-CAT), a patient-reported outcome questionnaire that uses computerized adaptive testing to measure anxiety. METHODS: The A-CAT builds on an item bank of 50 items that has been built using conventional item analyses and item response theory analyses. The A-CAT was administered on Personal Digital Assistants to n=357 patients diagnosed and treated at the department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Charite Berlin, Germany. For validation purposes, two subgroups of patients (n=110 and 125) answered the A-CAT along with established anxiety and depression questionnaires. RESULTS: The A-CAT was fast to complete (on average in 2 min, 38 s) and a precise item response theory based CAT score (reliability>.9) could be estimated after 4-41 items. On average, the CAT displayed 6 items (SD=4.2). Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures. CONCLUSIONS: The German A-CAT is an efficient, reliable, and valid tool for assessing anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders and other conditions with significant potential for initial assessment and long-term treatment monitoring. Future research directions are to explore content balancing of the item selection algorithm of the CAT, to norm the tool to a healthy sample, and to develop practical cutoff scores.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of chronic (recurrent) otitis media with effusion (OME) on frequency weighting in the perception of speech in noise. It was hypothesized that children with a history of OME weight speech information in the mid frequency region higher than control children. DESIGN: This is a matched cohort study looking at differences in frequency weighting in 12 children with a history of OME 1 to 2 wks after placement of tympanostomy tubes compared with 21 control children. Children were tested on their ability to identify key words in sentences presented in speech-shaped noise. The frequency content of the sentences was manipulated to determine the relative importance of frequencies in the regions of 1, 2, and 4 kHz. The frequency bands selected were 798 to 1212 Hz (low band), 1575 to 2425 Hz (mid band), and 3000 to 5000 Hz (high band). Initial testing involved adaptive runs where a speech-shaped masker was held at a constant level and the level of the speech with all three bands present varied. Once a level corresponding to 85% to 90% correct was identified, novel sentences were then presented at this signal-to-noise ratio in fixed block runs, with all bands present, or with one of the three bands omitted. RESULTS: The children in the OME group achieved 85% to 90% correct at a lower signal-to-noise ratio than controls in the adaptive testing, where all three speech bands were present. Fixed block testing indicated that children with OME history gave more weight to speech frequencies in the region of 2000 Hz compared with the age-matched control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with an interpretation that the development of frequency weighting in the perception of speech can be affected by a history of OME.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a first computerized adaptive test (CAT) for the measurement of stress perception (Stress-CAT), in terms of the two dimensions: exposure to stress and stress reaction. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Item response theory modeling was performed using a two-parameter model (Generalized Partial Credit Model). The evaluation of the Stress-CAT comprised a simulation study and real clinical application. A total of 1,092 psychosomatic patients (N1) were studied. Two hundred simulees (N2) were generated for a simulated response data set. Then the Stress-CAT was given to n=116 inpatients, (N3) together with established stress questionnaires as validity criteria. RESULTS: The final banks included n=38 stress exposure items and n=31 stress reaction items. In the first simulation study, CAT scores could be estimated with a high measurement precision (SE<0.32; rho>0.90) using 7.0+/-2.3 (M+/-SD) stress reaction items and 11.6+/-1.7 stress exposure items. The second simulation study reanalyzed real patients data (N1) and showed an average use of items of 5.6+/-2.1 for the dimension stress reaction and 10.0+/-4.9 for the dimension stress exposure. Convergent validity showed significantly high correlations. CONCLUSIONS: The Stress-CAT is short and precise, potentially lowering the response burden of patients in clinical decision making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the combination of item response theory and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for psychiatric measurement as a means of reducing the burden of research and clinical assessments. METHODS: Data were from 800 participants in outpatient treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder; they completed 616 items of the 626-item Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Scales (MASS) at two times. The first administration was used to design and evaluate a CAT version of the MASS by using post hoc simulation. The second confirmed the functioning of CAT in live testing. RESULTS: Tests of competing models based on item response theory supported the scale's bifactor structure, consisting of a primary dimension and four group factors (mood, panic-agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, and social phobia). Both simulated and live CAT showed a 95% average reduction (585 items) in items administered (24 and 30 items, respectively) compared with administration of the full MASS. The correlation between scores on the full MASS and the CAT version was .93. For the mood disorder subscale, differences in scores between two groups of depressed patients--one with bipolar disorder and one without--on the full scale and on the CAT showed effect sizes of .63 (p<.003) and 1.19 (p<.001) standard deviation units, respectively, indicating better discriminant validity for CAT. CONCLUSIONS: Instead of using small fixed-length tests, clinicians can create item banks with a large item pool, and a small set of the items most relevant for a given individual can be administered with no loss of information, yielding a dramatic reduction in administration time and patient and clinician burden.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was initiated to improve precision, reduce respondent burden, and enhance the comparability of health outcomes measures. We used item response theory (IRT) to construct and evaluate a preliminary item bank for physical function assuming four subdomains. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data from seven samples (N=17,726) using 136 items from nine questionnaires were evaluated. A generalized partial credit model was used to estimate item parameters, which were normed to a mean of 50 (SD=10) in the US population. Item bank properties were evaluated through Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) simulations. RESULTS: IRT requirements were fulfilled by 70 items covering activities of daily living, lower extremity, and central body functions. The original item context partly affected parameter stability. Items on upper body function, and need for aid or devices did not fit the IRT model. In simulations, a 10-item CAT eliminated floor and decreased ceiling effects, achieving a small standard error (< 2.2) across scores from 20 to 50 (reliability >0.95 for a representative US sample). This precision was not achieved over a similar range by any comparable fixed length item sets. CONCLUSION: The methods of the PROMIS project are likely to substantially improve measures of physical function and to increase the efficiency of their administration using CAT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methods based on item response theory (IRT) that can be used to examine differential item functioning (DIF) are illustrated. An IRT-based approach to the detection of DIF was applied to physical function and general distress item sets. DIF was examined with respect to gender, age and race. The method used for DIF detection was the item response theory log-likelihood ratio (IRTLR) approach. DIF magnitude was measured using the differences in the expected item scores, expressed as the unsigned probability differences, and calculated using the non-compensatory DIF index (NCDIF). Finally, impact was assessed using expected scale scores, expressed as group differences in the total test (measure) response functions. METHODS: The example for the illustration of the methods came from a study of 1,714 patients with cancer or HIV/AIDS. The measure contained 23 items measuring physical functioning ability and 15 items addressing general distress, scored in the positive direction. RESULTS: The substantive findings were of relatively small magnitude DIF. In total, six items showed relatively larger magnitude (expected item score differences greater than the cutoff) of DIF with respect to physical function across the three comparisons: "trouble with a long walk" (race), "vigorous activities" (race, age), "bending, kneeling stooping" (age), "lifting or carrying groceries" (race), "limited in hobbies, leisure" (age), "lack of energy" (race). None of the general distress items evidenced high magnitude DIF; although "worrying about dying" showed some DIF with respect to both age and race, after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that many physical function items showed DIF with respect to age, even after adjustment for multiple comparisons, indicates that the instrument may be performing differently for these groups. While the magnitude and impact of DIF at the item and scale level was minimal, caution should be exercised in the use of subsets of these items, as might occur with selection for clinical decisions or computerized adaptive testing. The issues of selection of anchor items, and of criteria for DIF detection, including the integration of significance and magnitude measures remain as issues requiring investigation. Further research is needed regarding the criteria and guidelines appropriate for DIF detection in the context of health-related items.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluate a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire that uses computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to measure the impact of osteoarthritis (OA) on functioning and well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OA patients completed 37 questions about the impact of OA on physical, social and role functioning, emotional well-being, and vitality. Questionnaire responses were calibrated and scored using item response theory, and two scores were estimated: a Total-OA score based on patients' responses to all 37 questions, and a simulated CAT-OA score where the computer selected and scored the five most informative questions for each patient. Agreement between Total-OA and CAT-OA scores was assessed using correlations. Discriminant validity of Total-OA and CAT-OA scores was assessed with analysis of variance. Criterion measures included OA pain and severity, patient global assessment, and missed work days. RESULTS: Simulated CAT-OA and Total-OA scores correlated highly (r = 0.96). Both Total-OA and simulated CAT-OA scores discriminated significantly between patients differing on the criterion measures. F-statistics across criterion measures ranged from 39.0 (P < .001) to 225.1 (P < .001) for the Total-OA score, and from 40.5 (P < .001) to 221.5 (P < .001) for the simulated CAT-OA score. CONCLUSIONS: CAT methods produce valid and precise estimates of the impact of OA on functioning and well-being with significant reduction in response burden.

AB  - False impairment is encountered when tested subjects either unintentionally or deliberately put an artificial upper limit on their force, in which case their true capacity cannot be disclosed in a straight forward measurement. The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive testing (CAT) system for directing subjects into generating greater forces than they intended. The system was tested on eleven cooperative female subjects who volunteered to take part in this study. The CAT consisted of interactive testing cycles, each containing a series of isometric tasks of differing intensities. While fulfilling these tasks, the tested subjects were asked to take care not to exceed a self-selected upper force limit (F(ssl)) that they were previously trained to memorize (order of 40% of the maximal voluntary contraction). Visual feedback, displaying the applied force exertions, was provided to the tested subjects but was modified by re-scaling the display in an un-anticipated manner. To confirm the subject's ability to remember her F(ssl), repeatability of joint memory was tested one week after the CAT. The CAT results were successful in causing ten out of the eleven tested participants to exert a higher force than they intended to. Additionally, the CAT algorithm caused a statistically significant higher force than the repeatability test. These results demonstrate the potential of CAT methods in improving the clinical evaluation of muscle strength, particularly in those cases where the subject's cooperation is not sufficient.

AB  - MOTIVATION: An important task in microarray data analysis is the selection of genes that are differentially expressed between different tissue samples, such as healthy and diseased. However, microarray data contain an enormous number of dimensions (genes) and very few samples (arrays), a mismatch which poses fundamental statistical problems for the selection process that have defied easy resolution. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a novel approach to the selection of differentially expressed genes in which test statistics are learned from data using a simple notion of reproducibility in selection results as the learning criterion. Reproducibility, as we define it, can be computed without any knowledge of the 'ground-truth', but takes advantage of certain properties of microarray data to provide an asymptotically valid guide to expected loss under the true data-generating distribution. We are therefore able to indirectly minimize expected loss, and obtain results substantially more robust than conventional methods. We apply our method to simulated and oligonucleotide array data.

AB  - In designing a comparative clinical trial, the required sample size is a function of the effect size, the value of which is unknown and at best may be estimated from historical data. Insufficiency in sample size as a result of overestimating the effect size can be destructive to the success of the clinical trial. Sample size re-estimation may need to be properly considered as a part of clinical trial planning. This paper is intended to give the motivations for the sample size re-estimation based partly on the effect size observed at an interim analysis and for a resulting simple adaptive test strategy. The performance of this adaptive design strategy is assessed by comparing it with a fixed maximum sample size design that is properly adjusted in anticipation of the possible sample size adjustment.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To develop computerized adaptive tests (CATs) designed to assess lower extremity functional status (FS) in people with lower extremity impairments using items from the Lower Extremity Functional Scale and compare discriminant validity of FS measures generated using all items analyzed with a rating scale Item Response Theory model (theta(IRT)) and measures generated using the simulated CATs (theta(CAT)). METHODS: Secondary analysis of retrospective intake rehabilitation data. RESULTS: Unidimensionality of items was strong, and local independence of items was adequate. Differential item functioning (DIF) affected item calibration related to body part, that is, hip, knee, or foot/ankle, but DIF did not affect item calibration for symptom acuity, gender, age, or surgical history. Therefore, patients were separated into three body part specific groups. The rating scale model fit all three data sets well. Three body part specific CATs were developed: each was 70% more efficient than using all LEFS items to estimate FS measures. theta(IRT) and theta(CAT) measures discriminated patients by symptom acuity, age, and surgical history in similar ways. theta(CAT) measures were as precise as theta(IRT) measures. CONCLUSION: Body part-specific simulated CATs were efficient and produced precise measures of FS with good discriminant validity.

AB  - Physical, psychosocial, and lifestyle disturbances, along with physical and emotional symptoms, have been shown to impact the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of those dependent on renal replacement therapy. The value of HRQOL measurement as a tool to improve clinical care has been recognized by patients, clinical investigators, and health care providers. The potential importance of HRQOL assessment lies in the additional information it provides and the impact it has on the clinical decision-making process between a patient and a physician. There remain a multitude of challenges facing renal providers who wish to incorporate HRQOL measurement to improve patient care. These challenges include the clinician's understanding of the conceptual model of HRQOL, the quality of the scientific process that contributed to the current literature on HRQOL, a willingness of the clinician to incorporate HRQOL information into clinical practice, and the logistic difficulties of collecting and applying HRQOL data in a busy practice setting. Arguably, optimizing HRQOL may be the most substantial impact the health care team will have on the person with kidney failure. In order to implement HRQOL assessment at the point of care, providers may consider using computer adaptive testing and scoring algorithms using item response theory, which will allow adequate reliability for interpretation of change among individuals. Moreover, the effective assessment and interpretation of HRQOL will be aided by continued publication of norms, outcomes of randomized controlled trials, and continued experience of investigators and clinicians.

AB  - A multistage testing strategy to detect QTL for resistance to infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon is proposed. First, genotyping of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) were carried out using dead offspring from a disease resistance challenge test. Second, AFLP genotyping among survivors followed by a Mendelian segregation test was performed. Third, within-family survival analyses using all offspring were developed and applied to significant TDT markers with Mendelian inheritance. Maximum-likelihood methodology was developed for TDT with dominant markers to exploit linkage disequilibrium within families. The strategy was tested with two full-sib families of Atlantic salmon sired by the same male and consisting of 79 offspring in total. All dead offspring from the two families were typed for 64 primer combinations, resulting in 340 scored markers. There were 26 significant results out of 401 TDTs using dead offspring. In the second stage, only 17 marker families showed Mendelian segregation and were tested in survival analysis. A permutation test was performed for all survival analyses to compute experimentwise P-values. Two markers, aaccac356 and agccta150, were significant at P < 0.05 when accounting for multiple testing in the survival analyses. The proposed strategy might be more powerful than current mapping strategies because it reduces the number of tests to be performed in the last testing stage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Item response theory (IRT) is a powerful framework for analyzing multiitem scales and is central to the implementation of computerized adaptive testing. OBJECTIVES: To explain the use of IRT to examine measurement properties and to apply IRT to a questionnaire for measuring migraine impact--the Migraine Specific Questionnaire (MSQ). METHODS: Data from three clinical studies that employed the MSQ-version 1 were analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis for categorical data and by IRT modeling. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses showed very high correlations between the factors hypothesized by the original test constructions. Further, high item loadings on one common factor suggest that migraine impact may be adequately assessed by only one score. IRT analyses of the MSQ were feasible and provided several suggestions as to how to improve the items and in particular the response choices. Out of 15 items, 13 showed adequate fit to the IRT model. In general, IRT scores were strongly associated with the scores proposed by the original test developers and with the total item sum score. Analysis of response consistency showed that more than 90% of the patients answered consistently according to a unidimensional IRT model. For the remaining patients, scores on the dimension of emotional function were less strongly related to the overall IRT scores that mainly reflected role limitations. Such response patterns can be detected easily using response consistency indices. Analysis of test precision across score levels revealed that the MSQ was most precise at one standard deviation worse than the mean impact level for migraine patients that are not in treatment. Thus, gains in test precision can be achieved by developing items aimed at less severe levels of migraine impact. CONCLUSIONS: IRT proved useful for analyzing the MSQ. The approach warrants further testing in a more comprehensive item pool for headache impact that would enable computerized adaptive testing.

AB  - Identifying health-related quality of life concerns is a priority when caring for people with cancer. Specific problem areas such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, disease- and treatment-related symptoms, as well as physical functioning can be routinely assessed using applications that draw upon item response theory. Item response theory measurement models can improve on the classical approach to health-related quality of life assessment with advantages that include comparison of patients across diverse instruments, flexibility in degree of precision desired, availability of multiple short forms, interval measurement and capability for individual assessment (real-time clinical monitoring) using computerized adaptive testing. This review describes a model of health-related quality of life in oncology and the contribution of item response theory to assessment using that model.

AB  - A number of issues critical to the development of computer-based neuropsychological testing systems that remain continuing challenges to their widespread use in occupational and environmental health are reviewed. Several computer-based neuropsychological testing systems have been developed over the last 20 years, and they have contributed substantially to the study of neurologic effects of a number of environmental exposures. However, many are no longer supported and do not run on contemporary personal computer operating systems. Issues that are continuing challenges for development of computer-based neuropsychological tests in environmental and occupational health are discussed: (1) some current technological trends that generally make test development more difficult; (2) lack of availability of usable speech recognition of the type required for computer-based testing systems; (3) implementing computer-based procedures and tasks that are improvements over, not just adaptations of, their manually-administered predecessors; (4) implementing tests of a wider range of memory functions than the limited range now available; (5) paying more attention to motivational influences that affect the reliability and validity of computer-based measurements; and (6) increasing the usability of and audience for computer-based systems. Partial solutions to some of these challenges are offered. The challenges posed by current technological trends are substantial and generally beyond the control of testing system developers. Widespread acceptance of the "tablet PC" and implementation of accurate small vocabulary, discrete, speaker-independent speech recognition would enable revolutionary improvements to computer-based testing systems, particularly for testing memory functions not covered in existing systems. Dynamic, adaptive procedures, particularly ones based on item-response theory (IRT) and computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) methods, will be implemented in new tests that will be more efficient, reliable, and valid than existing test procedures. These additional developments, along with implementation of innovative reporting formats, are necessary for more widespread acceptance of the testing systems.

AB  - Virtual environments (VEs), offering a new human-computer interaction paradigm, have attracted much attention, in clinical psychology, especially in the treatment of phobias. However, a possible new application of VR in psychology is as assessment tool: VEs can be considered as an highly sophisticated form of adaptive testing. This chapter describes the context of current psychological assessment and underlines possible advantages of a VR based assessment tool. The chapter also details the characteristics of BIVRS, Body Image Virtual Reality Scale, an assessment tool designed to assess cognitive and affective components of body image. It consists of a non-immersive 3D graphical interface through which the patient is able to choose between 9 figures of different size which vary in size from underweight to overweight. The software was developed in two architectures, the first (A) running on a single user desktop computer equipped with a standard virtual reality development software and the second (B) splitted into a server (B1) accessible via Internet and actually running the same virtual ambient as in (A) and a VRML client (B2) so that anyone can access the application.

AB  - The comparability and validity of a computerized adaptive (CA) Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) were assessed in a sample of 571 undergraduate college students. The CA MMPI-2 administered adaptively Scales L, E the 10 clinical scales, and the 15 content scales, utilizing the countdown method (Butcher, Keller, & Bacon, 1985). All subjects completed the MMPI-2 twice, with three experimental conditions: booklet test-retest, booklet-CA, and conventional computerized (CC)-CA. Profiles across administration modalities show a high degree of similarity, providing evidence for the comparability of the three forms. Correlations between MMPI-2 scales and other psychometric measures (Beck Depression Inventory; Symptom Checklist-Revised; State-Trait Anxiety and Anger Scales; and the Anger Expression Scale) support the validity of the CA MMPI-2. Substantial item savings may be realized with the implementation of the countdown procedure.
