AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

AB  - Although the functionalist perspective on emotional development posits that emotions serve adaptive functions, empirical tests of the role of anger mostly focus on how anger contributes to dysfunction. Developmentally, as children gain agency and skill at emotion regulation between the ages of 36 months and 48 months, their modulation of anger may facilitate its functional role for behavior. We examined this possibility through study of how 120 children's anger and sadness were related to persistence during the transparent locked box task at ages 36 and 48 months. Using survival analyses, we examined how children's anger and sadness were related to their giving up during the challenging task, and whether those relations were moderated by age. Using hidden Markov models (HMMs), we examined how children transitioned among anger, sadness, and on-task behavior states and whether those dynamics differed with age. Survival analysis revealed that age moderated the relation between anger and giving up. Greater anger was associated with greater likelihood of giving up earlier in the task at 36 months but with lower likelihood of giving up at 48 months. HMM analyses revealed that children were more likely to transition from a Calm/On-task to Calm/Off-task state at 36 months than at 48 months; that children were more likely to remain in an Anger/On-task state at 36 months than at 48 months; and that children were more likely to transition from Calm/On-task to Anger/On-task, and from Anger/On-task back to Calm/On-task at 48 months than at 36 months. Taken together, the findings suggest that anger appraisals may facilitate children in maintaining persistence, but that this functionality may develop with age.

AB  - The present study investigated the implications of computer-adaptive testing (operationalized by way of multistage adaptive testing; MAT) and "conventional" fixed order computer testing for various test-relevant outcomes in numeracy, including achievement, test-relevant motivation and engagement, and subjective test experience. It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students' test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students' test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

AB  - Studies have shown that test anxiety has become more prevalent since the adoption of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 and that test anxiety negatively affects student achievement. Early research viewed test anxiety as being a unidimensional construct; however, recent research has purported that test anxiety is a multidimensional construct. Consequently, test anxiety being viewed as multidimensional has changed how test anxiety is measured as evidenced by the development of multidimensional test anxiety measurement scales. Literature indicates that there is a gap in the study of K-12 test anxiety and response time data on assessments. A nonexperimental correlational research design was used for this study. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between multidimensional test anxiety measures and the response time of students taking a computerized adaptive math assessment, the "Measures of Academic Progress"® (MAP®) by the Northwest Evaluation Association™ (NWEA™), while controlling for gender. Participants for the study were 215 seventh grade math students at a school in the West. The test anxiety of participants was measured using the Children's Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS). The response time data was captured by the NWEA™ MAP® math tests. Spearman correlations were used to examine the relationship between test anxiety and response time. No statistically significant relationships were found. Recommendations for future research are to examine relationships between test anxiety and RTE using different normative thresholds (NT) and utilizing other multidimensional test anxiety scales as they become commercially available.

AB  - Technology-Enhanced Items (TEIs) have been purported to be more motivating and engaging to test takers than traditional multiple-choice items. The claim of enhanced engagement, however, has thus far received limited research attention. This study examined the rates of rapid-guessing behavior received by three types of items (multiple-choice, multiple select, and TEIs) on a commonly-used K-12 adaptive achievement test. Across three subject areas, the TEIs consistently showed the lowest rapid guessing rate, suggesting that their use may help mitigate the problem of disengaged test taking.

AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the "SE" is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the "SE" threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the "SE" stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a universal social skills program, the Social Skills Improvement System Classwide Intervention Program (SSIS-CIP; Elliott & Gresham, 2007), for students in first grade. Classrooms from 6 elementary schools were randomly assigned to treatment or business-as-usual control conditions. Teachers assigned to the treatment condition implemented the SSIS-CIP over a 12-week period. Students' social skills, problem behaviors, and approaches to learning were assessed via teacher ratings and direct observations of classroom behavior. In addition, their early literacy and numeracy skills were measured via computer-adaptive standardized tests. SSIS-CIP participation yielded small positive effects in students' social skills (particularly empathy and social engagement) and approaches to learning (academic motivation and engagement). Students' problem behaviors and academic skills, however, were unaffected by SSIS-CIP exposure.

AB  - Scholarship regarding adolescent resilience has typically defined resilience as the absence of negative outcomes rather than the existence of positive outcomes. This study drew on the challenge model of resilience, which anticipates a curvilinear relationship between stress exposure and adaptive functioning, to test whether adolescents reporting moderate levels of stress exposure were more likely to evidence prosocial behavior than youth exposed to more or less stress. Using data from approximately 13,000 adolescents, we tested three analytic models and investigated hypothesized moderation by coping, social resources, and markers of adolescent status. Our results did not align with the challenge model. Instead, we found that stress exposure was differentially associated with measures of prosocial behavior, that social resources supported volunteering but impeded helping a peer in some instances, and that markers of historically marginalized status were more predictive of stopping peer harassment than volunteering. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of CATSIB (Computer Adaptive Testing-Simultaneous Item Bias Test) for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) when items in the matching and studied subtest are administered adaptively in the context of a realistic multi-stage adaptive test (MST). MST was simulated using a 4-item module in a 7-panel administration. Three independent variables, expected to affect DIF detection rates, were manipulated: item difficulty, sample size, and balanced/unbalanced design. CATSIB met the acceptable criteria, meaning that the Type I error and power rates met 5% and 80%, respectively, for the large reference/moderate focal sample and the large reference/large focal sample conditions. These results indicate that CATSIB can be used to consistently and accurately detect DIF on an MST, but only with moderate to large samples. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Current CAT applications consist of predominantly dichotomous items, and CATs with polytomously scored items are limited. To ascertain the best approach to polytomous CAT, a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection, ability estimation, and impact of termination rules based on polytomous IRT models. Few studies investigated the optimal pool characteristics for polytomous CAT implementation. Using the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) (Muraki, 1992), this study aims to identify an optimal item pool design for tests with polytomous items by extending the p-optimality method (Reckase, 2007). The extension includes the definition of atheta-bin to describe polytomous items succinctly for pool design, and item generation strategy using constrained nonlinear optimization method. Optimal item pools are generated using CAT simulations with and without practical constraints. The item pool characteristics under each condition are summarized and their performance is evaluated against an extended operational item pool. The results indicated that the practical constraints of the a-stratified exposure control and content balancing do not affect pool size to a large extent. However, the a-stratified control affects the pool characteristics greatly: the items included in the simulated pools with the control have larger a-parameter and provide higher maximum information on average. On the other hand, the content balancing applied in this study has little impact on pool design. The evaluation results of the pool performance are closely related to the pool characteristics. When the a-stratified exposure control applied, the consistent results include: 1) the average test information is lower than that without the constraint; 2) RMSE is higher and the correlation between the true and estimated abilities is lower; 3) the percentage of the correct classification for the highest achievement level is lower. However, for all the simulated optimal pools, while the test information is consistently above the target level 10.0, it is concluded that the a-stratified method resulted in an efficient use of less discriminative items with small decreases in measurement precision. With regard to the item pool usage, the percentage of items that are fully used, well used, rarely used, and never used are quite comparable for the pools designed with constraints. However, compared with the extended operational pool, when the a-stratified method applied, the conditional test overlap rate of the simulated pools is consistently lower. For the pool blueprint, because the normal ability distribution is assumed, more items are included in the middle of the ability scale for all simulated optimal pools. The distributions of the a- and b- parameters are similar under all conditions. When the a-stratified method applied, there are fewer items in the first stratum and the number of items in the second and third stratum is nearly identical. In addition, with the content balancing control, the number of items in the first content area is slightly less than the second one.

AB  - Measuring the implementation fidelity (IF) or integrity of interventions is crucial, otherwise a positive or negative outcome cannot be interpreted. Direct and indirect methods of IF measurement tend to over-emphasize teacher behaviour. This paper focuses on IF measured by student behaviour collected through computers. Attainment was measured by the STAR test of maths (a computerized item-banked adaptive norm-referenced test). Implementation quality (IF) was measured by Accelerated Maths (AM) (an instruction-free personalized practice and progress-monitoring system in mastery of mathematics skills). Attainment data was gathered in the UK on 20,103 students in 148 schools, and of these implementation data on n = 6,285. Only a small percentage of pupils scored on five AM implementation indices at or above the levels recommended. Correlations between attainment and implementation indices were modest, but high implementation was positively correlated with high attainment. Socio-economic status did not appear to affect implementation or attainment. Implementation quality of AM is clearly a problem in the UK, and needs improvement. However, overall students still scored above average on attainment.

AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Background of the study: Leadership is needed when one must deal with education management which means the relationship of influence between the leader and followers who have the same goal, to make a change. It can be used as a guideline in the planning and creating evaluation criteria to improve the adaptive leadership of teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which consistent with the theory and the research result as well as the vision from scholars and organization. Objective: The objectives of this research were to (a) develop a theoretical model of structural relationship of major components, minor components and indicators of adaptive leadership, (b) test the fitness of the model was developed from theoretical model and empirical data, and (c) verify the factor loading value of the major components, minor components and indicators. Materials and Methods: The descriptive research collected by using the 5-level rating scale questionnaire. The population consisted of 1,740 teachers in Boromarajonani college of nursing under Boromarajchanok Institute. The data analysis using AMOS statistical program was done with the 617-return questionnaire. Results: The results showed that the theoretical model was consistent with empirical data with the following statistical metrics: relative Chi-square (CMIN/DF) < 3.00, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.05, goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and normed fit index (NFI) 0.90-1.00 were in accordance with the criteria from both the first and second order of confirmative factor analysis. The major components had factor loading ranging from 0.71 to 1.00, which is higher than the criterion as 0.70. The minor components and indicators had factor loading are higher than the criterion as 0.30. Conclusion: The finding can be used as a guideline in the planning and creation of evaluation criteria to improve the adaptive leadership of teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which is consistent with the theory and research results as well as the vision from scholars and organization. This will help improve the performance efficiency of the teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which will affect the education management and education improvement.

AB  - The interactionist model (IM) of human development (R. D. Conger & M. B. Donellan, 2007) proposes that the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and human development involves a dynamic interplay that includes both social causation (SES influences human development) and social selection (individual characteristics affect SES). Using a multigenerational data set involving 271 families, the current study finds empirical support for the IM. Adolescent personality characteristics indicative of social competence, goal-setting, hard work, and emotional stability predicted later SES, parenting, and family characteristics that were related to the positive development of a third-generation child. Processes of both social selection and social causation appear to account for the association between SES and dimensions of human development indicative of healthy functioning across multiple generations.

AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) assumes that state-mandated tests provide useful information to school administrators and teachers. However, interviews with administrators and teachers suggest that Minnesota's tests, which are representative of the current generation of state-mandated tests, fail to provide useful information to administrators and teachers about areas that need attention. The use of a single level of difficulty causes harmful stress and provides measurements of poor quality for many students. Computer-adaptive tests are a practical alternative, provide more useful information, reduce stress among students, and address four major concerns that teachers have about testing. This alternative could strengthen the link between testing and improved educational outcomes and improve the chances that NCLB will have a positive impact. However, current federal policy prohibits the use of computer-adaptive tests for accountability purposes. This article provides specific recommendations that potentially could address four critical concerns about current state-mandated tests. (Contains 1 figure, 1 table, and 6 notes.)

AB  - Current interest in measuring quality of life is generating interest in the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) with Likert-type items. Calibration of an item bank for use in CAT requires collecting responses to a large number of candidate items. However, the number is usually too large to administer to each subject in the calibration sample. The concurrent anchor-item design solves this problem by splitting the items into separate subtests, with some common items across subtests; then administering each subtest to a different sample; and finally running estimation algorithms once on the aggregated data array, from which a substantial number of responses are then missing. Although the use of anchor-item designs is widespread, the consequences of several configuration decisions on the accuracy of parameter estimates have never been studied in the polytomous case. The present study addresses this question by simulation, comparing the outcomes of several alternatives on the configuration of the anchor-item design. The factors defining variants of the anchor-item design are (a) subtest size, (b) balance of common and unique items per subtest, (c) characteristics of the common items, and (d) criteria for the distribution of unique items across subtests. The results of this study indicate that maximizing accuracy in item parameter recovery requires subtests of the largest possible number of items and the smallest possible number of common items; the characteristics of the common items and the criterion for distribution of unique items do not affect accuracy.

AB  - The study evaluates an easily-administered test-anxiety reduction program. An entire fifth grade was screened, and 36 students identified as test-anxious were randomly assigned to an Intervention or a non-participant Control group. The intervention was an accelerated desensitization and adaptive attitudes (ADAA) treatment which involved stretch-tense, deep breath, release-relax and positive suggestion sequences to expedite anxiety reduction and also positive adaptive associations to each of eight learning, review, and testing scenes. The intervention was presented via a 31 minute recording, which students reviewed in five separate sessions over about half the school year. Test gains were calculated from the 2005 Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment tests (TCAPs) given after the intervention, adjusted for individual student 2004 TCAPs before the intervention. The Intervention group attained a significant seven percentile test gain over the Controls. The use of the recorded intervention is seen to vastly reduce the number of professional hours required for an anxiety-reduction program, and the program shows promise as a highly cost-effective means to benefit test-anxious students.

AB  - The 7th International Conference on Education Data Mining held on July 4th-7th, 2014, at the Institute of Education, London, UK is the leading international forum for high-quality research that mines large data sets in order to answer educational research questions that shed light on the learning process. These data sets may come from the traces that students leave when they interact, either individually or collaboratively, with learning management systems, interactive learning environments, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games or when they participate in a data-rich learning context. The types of data therefore range from raw log files to eyetracking devices and other sensor data. Being hosted in London, UK the theme of the conference is "Big Data--Big Ben--Education Data Mining for Big Impact in Teaching and Learning". In this seventh year of EDM conferences, it is clear that the field is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. With renewed focus on education driven by big data learning analytics has put the EDM field in the center of growing interest. Traditional educational technologies, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and learning management systems all continue to generate growing amounts of data that are becoming available for analysis. The new interest in MOOCs and their promise to reach thousands or even hundreds of thousands of students per class requires techniques for feedback and grading that are being researched in the EDM domain. The conference submissions this year also continue to grow. A tremendous amount of work has gone into bringing this conference together, and the following are presented: (1) The Field of EDM: Where We Came from and Where We're Going (Joseph Beck); (2) Generative Adaptivity for Optimization of the Learning Ecosystem (Zoran Popovic; (3) 150K+ Online Students at a Time: How to Understand What's Happening in Online 4 Learning (Daniel Russell); (4) Adaptive Practice of Facts in Domains with Varied Prior Knowledge (Jan Papoušek, Radek Pelánek and Vít Stanislav); (5) Alternating Recursive Method for Q-Matrix Learning (Yuan Sun, Shiwei Ye, Shunya Inoue and Yi Sun); (6) Application of Time Decay Functions and the Elo System in Student Modeling (Radek Pelánek); (7) Causal Discovery with Models: Behavior, Affect, and Learning in Cognitive Tutor Algebra (Stephen Fancsali); (8) Choice-Based Assessment: Can Choices Made in Digital Games Predict 6th-Grade Students' Math Test Scores?

AB  - The effects of providing immediate knowledge of results (KR) and adaptive testing on test anxiety and test-taking motivation were investigated. Also studied was the accuracy of student perceptions of the difficulty of adaptive and conventional tests administered with or without immediate knowledge of results. Testees were 350 college students divided into high- and low-ability groups and randomly assigned to one of four test strategies by KR conditions. The ability level of examinees was found to be related to their reported levels of motivation and to differences in reported motivation under the different testing conditions. These results suggest that adaptive testing creates a psychological environment for testing which is more equivalently motivating for examinees of all  ability levels and results in a greater standardization of the test-taking environment, than does conventional testing.

AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items  administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

AB  - According to item response theory (IRT), examinee ability estimation is independent of the particular set of test items administered from a calibrated pool. Although the most popular application of this feature of IRT is computerized adaptive (CA) testing, a recently proposed alternative is self-adapted (SA) testing, in which examinees choose the difficulty level of each of their test items. Examinee performance was compared under CA and SA testing conditions for college students from an introductory statistics course. Three test forms were developed, testing mathematical knowledge necessary for the course. The final pool contained 93 items which were administered to 204 subjects. The SA test yielded significantly higher ability scores, and examinees taking the SA test reported  significantly lower posttest state anxiety. Implications of the differences between the two test types for measurement practice are discussed. Three tables present study data. (Author/SLD)

AB  - Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) make it possible to estimate the ability of each student during the testing process. The computer presents items to students at the appropriate level, and students take different versions of the same test. Computerized testing increases the flexibility of test management in that: (1) tests are given on demand and scores are immediately available; (2) differences among administrators cannot affect scores and trained administrators are not needed; (3) tests can be individually paced; and (4) test security is increased. Computerized testing also offers options for timing and formatting, increases efficiency, and can provide accurate scores over a wide range of abilities. Some limitations to CATs are considered. CATs are not appropriate for some  subjects and skills. Hardware limitations restrict the types of items that can be administered by computer, and many schools simply do not have the resources to administer CATs. A relatively large sample is needed to norm test items; comparable scores depend heavily on the quality of the estimates of item characteristics because each student answers a different set of items. The military has been among the pioneers in using CATs and at least two public school systems have begun to use them. A list of six organizations involved in computerized adaptive testing is included. (SLD)

AB  - The equivalence of pencil and paper Rasch item calibrations when used in a computer adaptive test administration was explored in this study. Items (n=726) were precalibarted with the pencil and paper test administrations. A computer adaptive test was administered to 321 medical technology students using the pencil and paper precalibrations in the item selection algorithms and in the computation of examinee ability estimates. The response data from the computer adaptive test administration were analyzed yielding recalibrated item difficulties and examinee ability estimates. Item precalibrations were compared with item recalibrations. Examinee ability estimates obtained using the item precalibrations on the computer adaptive administration were compared with the examinee ability  estimates obtained from using the item recalibrations on the computer adaptive administration. The correlation for examinee ability estimates was 0.99 and for item correlations it was 0.90. Some item calibrations shifted but most remained consistent within the limits of error. Item shift, however, did not affect the ordering of examinee ability estimates. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 23 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - A new testing strategy that provides protection against the problem of having examinees in adaptive testing choose difficulty levels that are not matched to their proficiency levels was introduced and evaluated. The method, termed restricted self-adapted testing (RSAT), still provides examinees with a degree of control over the difficulty levels of their test items. The range of item choice is restricted to a region around the examinee's current proficiency estimate. Participants in this study were 186 students in grades 3 through 8 in the Portland (Oregon) Public School system during the winter of 1992-93, who were tested as part of an ongoing computerized adaptive testing program. Students were randomly assigned to a computerized adaptive test (CAT), a self-adaptive test  (SADT), or RSAT in mathematics. Results indicate no differences between CAT and SADT conditions in terms of mean proficiency and mean posttest state anxiety. The basic RSAT method appears to hold promise for providing examinees with control over the testing situation, while preventing large mismatches between item difficulty choice and proficiency level. The RSAT procedure should be evaluated empirically. (SLD)

AB  - This report examines how selection fairness is influenced by the characteristics of a selection instrument in terms of its distribution of item difficulties, level of item discrimination, degree of item bias, and testing strategy. Computer simulation was used in the administration of either a conventional or Bayesian adaptive ability test to a hypothetical target population consisting of a minority and majority subgroup. Fairness was evaluated by three indices which reflect the degree of differential validity, errors in prediction (Cleary's model), and proportion of applicants exceeding a selection cutoff (Thorndike's model). Major findings are: (1) when used in conjunction with either the Bayesian or conventional test, differential prediction increased fairness and facilitated  the interpretation of the fairness indices; (2) the Bayesian adaptive tests were consistently fairer than the conventional tests for all item pools above the alpha=.7 discrimination level for tests of more than 30 items; (3) the differential prediction version of the Bayesian adaptive test produced almost perfectly fair performance on all fairness indices at high discrimination levels; and (4) the placement of subgroup prior distribution in the Bayesian adaptive testing procedure can affect test fairness.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that, when administered a self-adapted test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a self-adapted test--lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT)--can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted self-adapted test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only in the region of their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class. The results show that while the RS-AT effectively  controlled the standard errors of proficiency estimation, examinees receiving an RS-AT did not show higher mean proficiency or lower posttest state anxiety than examinees receiving a CAT.

AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair  use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT  environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Two types of computerized testing have been defined: (1) computer-based testing, using a computer to administer conventional tests in which all examinees take the same set of items; and (2) adaptive tests, in which items are selected for administration by the computer, based on examinee's previous responses. This paper discusses an option for classroom teachers that is easier to develop than a computerized adaptive test, but more secure and sophisticated than a computer-based test. The process of developing and pilot testing the computer-administered test and the results of a survey of student reactions are described. Subjects for the study consisted of 108 undergraduates taking summer educational technology courses in computer applications at a Southern university. Identical  items were used for paper-and-pencil and computerized tests. No significant differences were found for either administration. Student responses indicated that: all of the students had familiarity with computers; 94% had no problems understanding the test directions; 53% initially experienced anxiety about taking the test on a computer; 89% indicated that the computer test was as fair as a paper test; and 61% indicated a preference for the computer test, while 19% indicated that both methods worked equally well. Four tables depict results for computerized tests versus paper-and-pencil tests; descriptive data for both kinds of tests; students' yes/no responses to the attitude survey; and examinee's comments regarding computerized testing.

The results show that students' task goal orientation and academic delay of gratification mediate the relationship between self-efficacy and the time students dedicate to study. These results are considered under the umbrella of Zimmerman's cyclical model of self-regulation, which posits that learners engage in sustaining cognition, behavior, and  emotions to pursue academic goals and intentions. The findings are also consistent with Mischel's self-regulatory approach, which assumes that effective delay of gratification is a function of motivation and voluntary postponement of immediate gratification in order to pursue later outcomes. The results demonstrate that students who have high self-efficacy are engaging in academic tasks for the sake of learning and mastering work, delay gratification and persist longer in goal directed study time. Implications for education and future research are discussed. Appended are: sample items from the Academic Volitional Strategy Scales and from the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey, Test Anxiety, Self-Efficacy and Reliability Cronbach Alphas.

AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only  one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.)  (Author/SLD)

AB  - During 1975-1979 this research into the potential of computerized adaptive testing to reduce errors in the measurement of human capabilities used Marine recruits for a live-testing validity comparison of computerized adaptive and conventional tests. The program purposes were to: (1) identify the most useful computer-based adaptive testing strategies; (2) identify testing conditions that maximize the positive rather than negative psychological effects of computerized testing; (3) investigate intra-individual multidimensionality problems in ability testing; (4) examine probabilistic responding and free-response methods for computerized adaptive testing in order to extract maximum information from each test item response; and (5) develop, refine and evaluate new computer  administered ability tests for spacial, perceptive, memory, and other abilities not now measurable using paper and pencil testing. Monte Carlo and Bayesian adaptive testing methods were used in these studies. Fifteen major findings, primarily on adaptive testing and test administration conditions, and implications for further research are given. Abstracts of the 16 research reports for studies for this program are given. (BS)

AB  - The differences in types of information-processing skills developed by different instructional backgrounds affect, negatively or positively, the learning of further advanced instructional materials. If prior and subsequent instructional methods are different, a proactive inhibition effect produces low achievement scores on a post test. This poses a serious problem for routing of students to an instructional level on the sole basis of performance on a diagnostic adaptive test and makes it essential to determine what information-processing strategy was used and consider this knowledge simultaneously. Response time often provides supplementary information which differentiates among individuals showing identical quality of performance. A model that reflects this kind of information,  obtainable from response time scores, is formulated in a similar manner to latent trait theory. This model is useful in identifying discriminating items that are sensitive to differences in instructional method. It also is helpful in identifying an individual's instructional background to a certain extent. (Author/CTM)

AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first  usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT.

AB  - Large-scale testing programs are generally based on the assumptions that the test-takers experience standard conditions for taking the test and that everyone will do his or her own work without having prior knowledge of specific questions. These assumptions are not necessarily true. The ways students and educators use to get around standardizing conditions to gain an advantage are described, and ways to reduce these behaviors are presented. In the first place, there is traditional cheating, by copying, or describing answers, which is enhanced by electronic gadgets or international exchanges of information. Lax security can result in the theft of test booklets. Teachers and other educators can undermine the validity of test by ignoring evidence of student preknowledge of the test  or by tacitly colluding with students by allowing access to test materials. The measurement community needs to do a better job of educating educators about the importance of standard conditions. Testing agencies or programs should audit some testing sites to determine the existence of standard conditions, and new techniques of test administration, including computer adaptive tests, must be developed to improve test security.
