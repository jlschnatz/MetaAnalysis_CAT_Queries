abstract = {This study focused on test-takers' psychological effects on computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The development and implementation of CAT were based on item response theory (IRT), and two-parameter logistic model was chosen for the items. The total of 268 students from a high school in Jinan took part in the English adaptive test. A structural equation model was used to examine the potential connections among a series of individual variables (computer self-efficacy, training satisfaction, test anxiety, CAT attitude and CAT performance). The findings revealed significant positive paths from computer self-efficacy and training satisfaction to CAT attitude, as well as a negative path from test anxiety to CAT performance. Furthermore, there was significant correlation between the residual variances of CAT attitude and CAT performance. Thus, it could be seen CAT might produce an unfair disadvantage for test-takers with higher test anxiety. The relevant research and implications were further discussed. The researches on CAT and psychological effects have yielded mixed results.A causal model of CAT was constructed in this study.The results showed that CAT might produce an unfair disadvantage for test-takers with higher test anxiety.CAT training and increasing computer self-efficacy could improve individual attitude to CAT.The differences in information technology facilities in different areas would not influence CAT performance significantly.},

abstract = {This work aims to reduce the test time per chip, but affect the quality of the products only as little as possible compared to the conventional semiconductor test. For that purpose, a simulation software has been developed that performs adaptive test simulations based on real data and test results of conventional production testing. Products has been analyzed and both the potential for test time savings and the resulting loss of quality are determined. Finally, it is shown that by the intelligent omission of tests, compared to conventional testing procedures, test time reduction of up to 50 % can be achieved. In contrast, there are only few defective components that are not detected by the adaptive test procedure and which reduced the quality of products. In best case, the fraction of test escapes was under 40 ppm. To handle the potential risk of test escapes this paper also introduces a statistical estimation method.},

title = {The Effects of Computerized Adaptive Testing and Examinee Test Motivation on Algebra Skills, Test Anxiety, and Attitudes},

abstract = {The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance. Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables.This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance.The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.},

abstract = {Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection). Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited.No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.},

abstract = {The wide variation in process parameters now being observed in advanced semiconductor processes can sometimes cause the electrical impact of subtle manufacturing defects on observed signals during post manufacturing tests to remain within the acceptable range set to ensure viable manufacturing yields, thereby masking defect detection. Such undetected manufacturing flaws can potentially cause functional failure under inputs and/or operating conditions not tested during test; they can also behave as latent reliability defects that "grow" over time to cause early life failure. Test methodologies that target the "zero-defect" product quality requirements being pushed by automotive and an increasing number of other applications must address such test escapes by using innovative statistical methods and adaptive testing because of the prohibitive costs of extensive functional and stress/burn-in testing of all parts. The basic idea here is similar to "zero-defect" security screening at airports: parts that pass the initial tests but appear to be "suspect" is some respect are separated out for more extensive tests. Also, additional specialized tests are adaptively added to the test flow to target the suspected failure mode; this requires both the feeding forward and feeding back of results from different stages of the testing process. A few seriously suspect but passing parts may even be discarded outright to ensure quality, if the resulting yield loss is acceptable.Advanced statistical screening methods fall into two broad categories: those that exploit the statistics of defect distribution on wafers - e.g. passing die in "bad" wafer neighborhoods are suspect parts; and those that exploit the correlation in performance parameters in lots and wafers - passing die that are performance outliers relative to matched parts are suspect. This tutorial presents screening methodologies that span both these categories, for both digital and analog parts. We illustrate their effectiveness using results from a number of published experimental studies on production circuits from IBM, Intel, LSI Logic, NXP Semiconductors, and MediaTek. The examples discussed focus on studies where the tests target classical stuck-at faults, as well as IDDQ testing, TDF and path delay timing tests, and also the newly introduced cell aware fault models.Recently, adaptive test methods have been more broadly defined to also include test time reduction techniques based on dynamic test reordering, adaptive scan shift frequency selection for each die, etc. The benefits and challenges of employing these methods are also discussed.Several new companies have emerged targeting the "Adaptive Test" space in recent years. Their commercial offerings are also presented and discussed. Broadly, these aim to provide the software infrastructure and tools needed to support the feed forward and feedback sharing of results from the different test insertions in the test flow for effective test adaptation and optimization. These test results are then utilized by customizable templates to generate automated test selection algorithms that can dynamically apply the most effective test at each test insertion/stage in the test flow, and also perform statistical binning once all testing is complete.},
