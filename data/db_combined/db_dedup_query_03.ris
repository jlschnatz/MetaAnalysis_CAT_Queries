AB  - This work aims to reduce the test time per chip, but affect the quality of the products only as little as possible compared to the conventional semiconductor test. For that purpose, a simulation software has been developed that performs adaptive test simulations based on real data and test results of conventional production testing. Product analyzes were performed and both the potential for test time savings and the resulting loss of quality were determined. Finally, it has shown that by the intelligent omission of tests, compared to conventional testing procedures, test time reduction of up to 50% can be achieved. In contrast, there are only few unrecognized defective components that are not detected by the adaptive test procedure and which reduced the quality of products. In best case, the fraction of nonconforming units was reduced down to values under 40ppm. To handle the potential risk of test escapes this paper also introduces a statistical estimation method.

AB  - The wide variation in process parameters now being observed in advanced semiconductor processes can sometimes cause the electrical impact of subtle manufacturing defects on observed signals during post manufacturing tests to remain within the acceptable range set to ensure viable manufacturing yields, thereby masking defect detection. Such undetected manufacturing flaws can potentially cause functional failure under inputs and/or operating conditions not tested during test; they can also behave as latent reliability defects that "grow" over time to cause early life failure. Test methodologies that target the "zero-defect" product quality requirements being pushed by automotive and an increasing number of other applications must address such test escapes by using innovative statistical methods and adaptive testing because of the prohibitive costs of extensive functional and stress/burn-in testing of all parts. The basic idea here is similar to "zero-defect" security screening at airports: parts that pass the initial tests but appear to be "suspect" is some respect are separated out for more extensive tests. Also, additional specialized tests are adaptively added to the test flow to target the suspected failure mode; this requires both the feeding forward and feeding back of results from different stages of the testing process. A few seriously suspect but passing parts may even be discarded outright to ensure quality, if the resulting yield loss is acceptable.Advanced statistical screening methods fall into two broad categories: those that exploit the statistics of defect distribution on wafers - e.g. passing die in "bad" wafer neighborhoods are suspect parts; and those that exploit the correlation in performance parameters in lots and wafers - passing die that are performance outliers relative to matched parts are suspect. This tutorial presents screening methodologies that span both these categories, for both digital and analog parts. We illustrate their effectiveness using results from a number of published experimental studies on production circuits from IBM, Intel, LSI Logic, NXP Semiconductors, and MediaTek. The examples discussed focus on studies where the tests target classical stuck-at faults, as well as IDDQ testing, TDF and path delay timing tests, and also the newly introduced cell aware fault models.Recently, adaptive test methods have been more broadly defined to also include test time reduction techniques based on dynamic test reordering, adaptive scan shift frequency selection for each die, etc. The benefits and challenges of employing these methods are also discussed.Several new companies have emerged targeting the "Adaptive Test" space in recent years. Their commercial offerings are also presented and discussed. Broadly, these aim to provide the software infrastructure and tools needed to support the feed forward and feedback sharing of results from the different test insertions in the test flow for effective test adaptation and optimization. These test results are then utilized by customizable templates to generate automated test selection algorithms that can dynamically apply the most effective test at each test insertion/stage in the test flow, and also perform statistical binning once all testing is complete.

AB  - Computer Assisted Testing (CAT) system in Indonesia has been commonly used but only to displaying random exam questions and unable to detect the maximum performance of the test participants. This research proposes a simple way with a good level of accuracy in identifying the maximum ability of test participants. By applying the Bayesian probabilistic in the selection of random questions with a weight of difficulties, the system can obtain optimal results from participants compared to sequential questions. The accuracy of the system measured on the choice of questions at the maximum level of the examinee alleged ability by the system, compared to the correct answer from participants gives an average accuracy of 75% compared to 33% sequentially. This technique allows tests to be carried out in a shorter time without repetition, which can affect the fatigue of the test participants in answering questions.

AB  - Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper and Pencil (P&P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate <ce><b8>. For the item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, <e2><80><a6>, 20, and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of the P&P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S (r > 0.5), (4) the value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the theoretically expected advantages, which enabled a rapid, accurate, and efficient dynamic and intelligent measurement of stress.

AB  - This paper analyzes a national technology and education program in Uruguay known as Plan Ceibal. This work studies a sample of over 105,000 students from 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of public primary education in that country. This work aims to assess the impact of technology on teaching and learning of English. The method adopted is based on log-file data to compare two different modalities of English teaching (a face-to-face and a blended model). Additionally, we explored the correlation between a common measure of online engagement when using the Learning Management System (LMS) and an adaptive English assessment. We examined the impact of the teaching modalities on the students engagement and to what extent the engagement can contribute to enhance the student learning of English. This work documents the steps followed to elaborate the common measure of engagement to ensure transparency and its replicability (or improvement). A strength of this work, in comparison with previous studies, is the number of cases analyzed as well as the age of the target population (primary school students). The results indicate that engagement is affected by at least three key factors: socio-cultural context, teaching modality, and the role that teachers play. In fact, the higher the engagement level, the larger the proportion of students who achieve a better learning outcome in the assessment. This study shows that the use of LMS enhanced the learning experience when this tool is integrated within the ecosystem of the teaching and learning process. The findings of this study are consistent with previous works in the field, for instance: the relevance of the context as well as the role of teaching. Although the measurement of engagement can help to understand students performance noteworthy that as a stand-alone dimension it is a poor predictor of performance. To consider additional factors associated with learning is still necessary.

At the same time, the governance of the education system and schools<e2><80><99> organizations have been exposed to unprecedented tensions. The pandemic emergency has been a lens revealing intersections and structural tensions among various level and actors of the education system, but also allowing opportunities of changes thanks to the exogenous shock. At the same time, it must be considered that the emergency is interacting on pre-existing inequalities and contradictions. Higher education systems have been affected too: in constant evolution due to constant transformations of society and changed functions of knowledge, universities have undergone a structural change along with pandemic times. Simultaneously, the growing relevance of knowledge for the economic development of the capitalistic system has profoundly affected higher education systems, characterized by the neo-liberal approach which his subject of increasing critical analysis. ; In this paper we present results on the estimation of mathematics skills of Italian grade 10 students with special educational needs. The estimation was carried out by means of a com-puter based multilevel adaptive test 1 - 3 - 3 (MST) constructed within the framework of a doctoral research in Social, Developmental and Educational Research Psychology. An item bank was used to construct the MST test. Verification of the unidimensionality of the bank was done through exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and analysis of model fit indices with Rasch's model (Rasch, 1960) being calibrated. Verification of the best measurement properties of the test compared to a linear test was performed by comparing information functions. It is shown that this type of test is able to provide estimates of the ability of students with a con-siderable level of ...

AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although high unemployment rates exist in many countries of the world, companies continue to struggle to hire candidates whose personality traits and competencies match their needs. High unemployment rates and a global talent shortage can be seen as a fascinating contradiction that merits future research. This study investigates suitable personnel selection methods that assist recruiters in seeking the right person with the potential to contribute most to a business. It consolidates theories about personnel selection in a cross-national setting and link them with specific personality traits, job competencies, and person-organization fit (P-O fit) that could predict and enhance employee outcomes. The Most Valuable Employees and Average Contribution Employees can be classified by using Data Envelopment analysis (DEA) and Na<c3><af>ve Bayesian analysis based on a set of standards. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), different aspects of personality traits, employee competencies, P-O fit, and biographic information, these characteristics are found to influence the key workplace outcomes in the United States and China. In both countries, the three dimensions in the HEXACO personality inventory (Honesty-Humility, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience) are found to significantly effect the workplace outcomes. In addition, job competencies, and P-O fit are also proven to be significantly associated with the key work outcomes in these two countries. There are several limitations in this study associated with a relative small number of primary data collected from them. However, this study employs a web-based dynamic survey system to save time, improve the response rate, and provide assessment accuracy. Furthermore, DEA and Na<c3><af>ve Bayesian classifiers help to separate the Most Valuable Employees from other employees, which may have practical significance for both researchers and practitioners.

AB  - To investigate differential item functioning (DIF) of PROMIS Depression items between US and German samples we compared data from the US PROMIS calibration sample (n = 780), a German general population survey (n = 2,500) and a German clinical sample (n = 621). DIF was assessed in an ordinal logistic regression framework, with 0.02 as criterion for R2 -change and 0.096 for Raju's non-compensatory DIF. Item parameters were initially fixed to the PROMIS Depression metric; we used plausible values to account for uncertainty in depression estimates. Only four items showed DIF. Accounting for DIF led to negligible effects for the full item bank as well as a post hoc simulated computer-adaptive test (< 0.1 point on the PROMIS metric [mean = 50, standard deviation =10]), while the effect on the short forms was small (< 1 point). The mean depression severity (43.6) in the German general population sample was considerably lower compared to the US reference value of 50. Overall, we found little evidence for language DIF between US and German samples, which could be addressed by either replacing the DIF items by items not showing DIF or by scoring the short form in German samples with the corrected item parameters reported.

AB  - Background: Assessing specific personality traits has shown better predictive power of enterprising personality than have broad personality traits. Hitherto, there have been no instruments that evaluate the combination of specific personality traits of enterprising personality in an adaptive format. So, the aim was to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) to assess enterprising personality in young people. Methods: A pool of 161 items was developed and applied to two sets of participants (n = 357 students, Mage = 17.89; SDage = 3.26; n = 2,693 students; Mage = 16.52, SDage = 1.38) using a stratified sampling method. Results: 107 items that assess achievement motivation, risk-taking, innovativeness, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, internal locus of control, and optimism were selected. The assumption of unidimensionality was tested. The CAT demonstrated high precision for a wide range of 8, using a mean of 10 items and demonstrating a relatively low Standard Error (0.378). Conclusions; A brief, valid, and precise instrument was obtained with relevant implications for educational and entrepreneurial contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although much work has been done on computerized-adaptive test (CAT) in reducing anxiety towards exam, CAT in Malaysian educational setting is less explored among educational researchers. Some of the reason is due to technical difficulty in developing, maintaining the testing bank items, and insufficient hardware facilities for huge number of examinees in Malaysia. Hence, traditional assessment method is preferred to assess students<e2><80><99> performance. However, traditional assessment induced students<e2><80><99> anxiety towards examination. The effect of anxiety towards mathematics examination has deteriorated students<e2><80><99> performance particularly at polytechnics that offers technical-vocational-education-and-training (TVET). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of CAT in reducing examinees<e2><80><99> anxiety towards mathematics examination in comparison with traditional testing approaches at three polytechnics in northern Malaysia that offered diploma certification in engineering. These three polytechnics were chosen because it is classified as conventional and accessibility of the researchers to these samples. In order to ensure the homogeneity of the samples, students in their first year of study who enrolled in engineering mathematics were chosen. This research used quasi-experimental research method with non-equivalent control group design involving 300 students. Item-response-theory was used to describe examinees<e2><80><99> interaction with the test items. The results show that CAT has reduced examinees<e2><80><99> anxiety towards mathematics test in comparison to those of traditional testing. This study implies that CAT has benefited students in term of reducing their anxiety towards mathematics examination in the case of Malaysian polytechnics students, and has the potential to be adopted in TVET because it improves testing efficiency.

AB  - In the past, a German Computerized Adaptive Test, based on Item Response Theory (IRT), was developed for purposes of assessing the construct depression [Computer-adaptive test for depression (D-CAT)]. This study aims at testing the feasibility and validity of the real computer-adaptive application. The D-CAT, supplied by a bank of 64 items, was administered on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a predetermined reliability (r <e2><89><a5> 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)]. The D-CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds), well accepted by the patients and reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95% of the cases, 10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between the D-CAT and the HADS, CES-D, and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The D-CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established questionnaires do. The D-CAT proved an efficient, well accepted and reliable tool. Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures, whereby the CAT is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item selection for content in the future.

AB  - Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. On average, patients took about 1.5 minutes (SD <2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal clinically important improvement. Because this study was a secondary analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future studies would benefit from more complete data. The results indicate the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design a new measure of caregiver-specific anxiety for use in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), the Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Caregiver-Specific Anxiety item bank. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty-four caregivers of civilians with TBI and 216 caregivers of service members/veterans with TBI (N=560). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety item bank. RESULTS: The retention of 40 Caregiver-Specific Anxiety items was supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning analyses supported the retention of 33 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM calibration data was used to select a 6-item static short form, and GRM calibration data was used to program the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety computer adaptive test (CAT). CONCLUSIONS: Established, rigorous measurement development standards were used to develop the new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety CAT and corresponding 6-item short form. This measure is the first patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess caregiver-specific anxiety in caregivers of individuals with TBI. The measure exhibits strong psychometric properties.

AB  - Land-based power units have to fulfill even more high levels of production and reliability. In harsh environments (desert and tropical installations, typically), the power unit ingests high amounts of dust that might deposit inside the compressor. In this paper, the analysis of a multistage compressor performance that operates under sandy and humid conditions has been assessed. The compressor units, that equips the Allison 250 C18 compressor, has been subjected to multiple runs under severe conditions of soil dust ingestion. The compressor has been operated according to subsequent runs and at the end of each run, the performance curve was recorded and the performance losses, in terms of pressure ratio, have been measured during the operations. The characteristic curve of each run is representative of the level of contamination of the unit. Finally, the compressor has been washed and the performance curve, in the recovered conditions, has been recorded. The results show the modification and the downward shift of the characteristic curves which lead to a gradual loss of the compressor performance. The curves realized after dust ingestion have been compared with the recovered curve after online washing. The measurement shows a promising recovery of the performances, even if, the compressor flow path appears affected by localized deposits able to resist to the droplet removal action. Detailed photographic reports of the IGV and the first compressor stages have been included in this analysis. After each run, the IGV, the rotor blade and stator vane of the first stage and the hub and the shroud surfaces have been photographed. The pictures show the deposition patterns on the blades and the compressor surfaces. The comparison of the pictures of the internal surfaces, before and after the washing, highlights the parts that are more critical to clean and needy of attention during offline washing and overhaul.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current suicide risk screening and measurement are inefficient, have limited measurement precision, and focus entirely on suicide-related items. For this study, a psychometric harmonization between related suicide, depression, and anxiety symptom domains that provides a more balanced and complete spectrum of suicidal symptomatology was developed. The objective of this article is to describe the results of the early stages of computerized adaptive testing development for a suicide scale and pave the way for the final stage of validation. METHODS: Data from psychiatric outpatients at the University of Pittsburgh and a community health clinic were collected from January 2010 through June 2012. 789 participants were enrolled in the calibration phase; 70% were female, and 30% were male. The rate of major depressive disorder as diagnosed by DSM-5 was 47%. The item bank contained 1,008 items related to depression, anxiety, and mania, including 11 suicide items. Data were analyzed using a bifactor model to identify a core dimension between suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and mania items. A computerized adaptive test was developed via simulation from the actual complete item responses in 308 subjects. RESULTS: 111 items were identified that provided an extension of suicidality assessment to include statistically related responses from depression and anxiety domains that are syndromally associated with suicidality. All items had high loadings on the primary suicide dimension (average = 0.67; range, 0.49-0.88). Analyses revealed that a mean of 10 items (5-20) had a correlation of 0.96 with the 111-item scale, with a precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale metric. Preliminary validation data based on 290 clinician interviews revealed a 52-fold increase in the likelihood of current suicidal ideation across the range of the Computerized Adaptive Test Suicide Scale (CAT-SS). CONCLUSIONS: The CAT-SS is able to accurately measure the latent suicide dimension with a mean of 10 items in approximately 2 minutes. Further validation against an independent clinician-administered assessment of suicide risk (ideation and attempts) and prediction of suicidal behavior is underway.

AB  - Computer administered tests are becoming increasingly prevalent as computer technology becomes more readily available on a large scale. For testing programs that utilize both computer and paper administrations, mode effects are problematic in that they can result in examinee scores that are artificially inflated or deflated. As such, researchers have engaged in extensive studies of whether scores differ across paper and computer presentations of the same tests. The research generally seems to indicate that the more complicated it is to present or take a test on computer, the greater the possibility of mode effects. In a computer adaptive test, mode effects may be a particular concern if items are calibrated using item responses obtained from one administration mode (i.e., paper), and those parameters are then used operationally in a different administration mode (i.e., computer). This paper studies the suitability of using parameters calibrated from a paper administration for item selection and scoring in a computer adaptive administration, for two tests with lengthy passages that required navigation in the computer administration. The results showed that the use of paper calibrated parameters versus computer calibrated parameters in computer adaptive administrations had small to moderate effects on the reliability of examinee scores, at fairly short test lengths. This effect was generally diminished for longer test lengths. However, the results suggest that in some cases, some loss in reliability might be inevitable if paper-calibrated parameters are used in computer adaptive administrations.

AB  - Highly efficient assessments that better account for comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders (internalizing) are required to identify individuals who are most at risk of psychopathology in the community. The current study examined the efficiency and validity associated with a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure broad and specific levels of internalizing psychopathology. The sample comprised 3,175 respondents to an online survey. Items from five banks (generalized anxiety, depression, obsessive<e2><80><93>compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder) were jointly calibrated using a bifactor item response theory model. Simulations indicated that an adaptive algorithm could accurately (rs <e2><89><a5> 0.90) estimate general internalizing and specific disorder scores using on average 44 items in comparison with the full 133-item bank (67% reduction in items). Scores on the CAT demonstrate convergent and divergent validity with previously validated short severity scales and could significantly differentiate cases of DSM-5 disorder. As such, the CAT validly measures both broad and specific constructs of internalizing disorders in a manner similar to the full item bank and a static brief form but with greater gains in efficiency and, therefore, a reduced degree of respondent burden.

AB  - Emotion knowledge in children includes emotion recognition in other peoples' faces, as well as understanding the internal and external causes and consequences of emotions and strategies for regulating them. To date, there is no measure in the German-speaking countries that captures emotion knowledge in a differentiated but also reliable and valid way. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM) aims to close this gap. The ATEM follows an adaptive design and six components of emotion knowledge. The 32 Rasch-scaled items are embedded in an attractive story and vary in their difficulty within and between the components. In a sample of 581 3 - 9-year-olds, the test showed a good fit to a six-dimensional model and very good psychometric properties. In a subsample of 254 3 - 5-year-olds, correlations between the ATEM and a measure of emotion knowledge and measures of expressive and receptive language abilities demonstrated good validity. The ATEM proved to be a good measure of emotion knowledge in children. ; Das Emotionswissen von Kindern umfasst neben dem Ablesen von Emotionen aus Gesichtern anderer Menschen auch das Erkennen von externalen und internalen Ursachen von Emotionen sowie das Wissen <c3><bc>ber ihre Konsequenzen und Regulationsm<c3><b6>glichkeiten.

Der ATEM fragt in einem adaptiven Design 6 Teilaspekte des Emotionswissens ab, wobei die 32 Items in eine kinderfreundliche Geschichte eingebettet sind. Der nach der Item-Response-Theorie aufgebaute Test zeigt mit einer Gesamtstichprobe von N = 581 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 9 Jahren gute psychometrische Eigenschaften. In einer Substichprobe von n = 254 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 5 Jahren wurde der ATEM anhand von Korrelationen mit verschiedenen Variablen validiert. Insgesamt eignet sich der ATEM gut zur differenzierten Messung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The assessment of recovery from burn injury is critical to improving pediatric health. However, there is a lack of brief, burn-specific measures to assess preschool-aged burn survivors<e2><80><99> health outcomes. We developed items pools for a new, parent-reported computer adaptive test based assessment of preschool-aged children<e2><80><99>s burn outcomes. Methods Initial item pools were informed by the Preschool LIBRE Conceptual Model based on the International Classification for Children (ICF) and the Burn Outcomes Questionnaires (BOQ 0<e2><80><93>5) and generated from a review of existing instruments assessing health and developmental outcomes in children 1<e2><80><93>5 years. Candidate items underwent a review process to bin items together based on the underlying construct they assessed. Items were then winnowed down and further refined based on clinical expert consensus meetings. The winnowing process focused on ensuring items assessed abilities and behaviors that could be reliably determined by parent report, were age-relevant, and focused on health and developmental concepts that are important in the assessment of children<e2><80><99>s burn recovery. To ensure item quality, we conducted parent cognitive interviews. In final reviews, we standardized item recall periods, response options, verb tense, and literacy demands. Results A total of 9,509 items were identified and extracted. Four item pool domains were established: communication and language development (42 items), physical functioning (53 items), psychological functioning (56 items), and social functioning (37 items). The respective item pools aim to assess: children<e2><80><99>s ability to receive meaning and produce language; children<e2><80><99>s gross and fine motor abilities; children<e2><80><99>s emotions and behavior (internalizing and externalizing behaviors, dysregulation, toileting, response to trauma and resilience); and children<e2><80><99>s social participation and abilities. Recall period and response options were refined for consistency for all 188 final items. Conclusions Four item pools were developed assessing four domains 1) communication and language development, 2) physical functioning, 3) psychological functioning and 4) social functioning for preschool-aged children. The item pools are currently being field-tested for the calibration and validation of the Preschool LIBRE CAT Profile. Applicability of Research to Practice This work is relevant to researchers and practitioners evaluating the effects of burn injury on preschool-aged children<e2><80><99>s health and developmental outcomes.

AB  - Although the functionalist perspective on emotional development posits that emotions serve adaptive functions, empirical tests of the role of anger mostly focus on how anger contributes to dysfunction. Developmentally, as children gain agency and skill at emotion regulation between the ages of 36 months and 48 months, their modulation of anger may facilitate its functional role for behavior. We examined this possibility through study of how 120 children's anger and sadness were related to persistence during the transparent locked box task at ages 36 and 48 months. Using survival analyses, we examined how children's anger and sadness were related to their giving up during the challenging task, and whether those relations were moderated by age. Using hidden Markov models (HMMs), we examined how children transitioned among anger, sadness, and on-task behavior states and whether those dynamics differed with age. Survival analysis revealed that age moderated the relation between anger and giving up. Greater anger was associated with greater likelihood of giving up earlier in the task at 36 months but with lower likelihood of giving up at 48 months. HMM analyses revealed that children were more likely to transition from a Calm/On-task to Calm/Off-task state at 36 months than at 48 months; that children were more likely to remain in an Anger/On-task state at 36 months than at 48 months; and that children were more likely to transition from Calm/On-task to Anger/On-task, and from Anger/On-task back to Calm/On-task at 48 months than at 36 months. Taken together, the findings suggest that anger appraisals may facilitate children in maintaining persistence, but that this functionality may develop with age.

AB  - Technology-Enhanced Items (TEIs) have been purported to be more motivating and engaging to test takers than traditional multiple-choice items. The claim of enhanced engagement, however, has thus far received limited research attention. This study examined the rates of rapid-guessing behavior received by three types of items (multiple-choice, multiple select, and TEIs) on a commonly-used K-12 adaptive achievement test. Across three subject areas, the TEIs consistently showed the lowest rapid guessing rate, suggesting that their use may help mitigate the problem of disengaged test taking.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of CATSIB (Computer Adaptive Testing-Simultaneous Item Bias Test) for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) when items in the matching and studied subtest are administered adaptively in the context of a realistic multi-stage adaptive test (MST). MST was simulated using a 4-item module in a 7-panel administration. Three independent variables, expected to affect DIF detection rates, were manipulated: item difficulty, sample size, and balanced/unbalanced design. CATSIB met the acceptable criteria, meaning that the Type I error and power rates met 5% and 80%, respectively, for the large reference/moderate focal sample and the large reference/large focal sample conditions. These results indicate that CATSIB can be used to consistently and accurately detect DIF on an MST, but only with moderate to large samples.

AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) assumes that state-mandated tests provide useful information to school administrators and teachers. However, interviews with administrators and teachers suggest that Minnesota's tests, which are representative of the current generation of state-mandated tests, fail to provide useful information to administrators and teachers about areas that need attention. The use of a single level of difficulty causes harmful stress and provides measurements of poor quality for many students. Computer-adaptive tests are a practical alternative, provide more useful information, reduce stress among students, and address four major concerns that teachers have about testing. This alternative could strengthen the link between testing and improved educational outcomes and improve the chances that NCLB will have a positive impact. However, current federal policy prohibits the use of computer-adaptive tests for accountability purposes. This article provides specific recommendations that potentially could address four critical concerns about current state-mandated tests. (Contains 1 figure, 1 table, and 6 notes.)

AB  - The 7th International Conference on Education Data Mining held on July 4th-7th, 2014, at the Institute of Education, London, UK is the leading international forum for high-quality research that mines large data sets in order to answer educational research questions that shed light on the learning process. These data sets may come from the traces that students leave when they interact, either individually or collaboratively, with learning management systems, interactive learning environments, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games or when they participate in a data-rich learning context. The types of data therefore range from raw log files to eyetracking devices and other sensor data. Being hosted in London, UK the theme of the conference is "Big Data--Big Ben--Education Data Mining for Big Impact in Teaching and Learning". In this seventh year of EDM conferences, it is clear that the field is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. With renewed focus on education driven by big data learning analytics has put the EDM field in the center of growing interest. Traditional educational technologies, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and learning management systems all continue to generate growing amounts of data that are becoming available for analysis. The new interest in MOOCs and their promise to reach thousands or even hundreds of thousands of students per class requires techniques for feedback and grading that are being researched in the EDM domain. The conference submissions this year also continue to grow.

AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

AB  - The equivalence of pencil and paper Rasch item calibrations when used in a computer adaptive test administration was explored in this study. Items (n=726) were precalibarted with the pencil and paper test administrations. A computer adaptive test was administered to 321 medical technology students using the pencil and paper precalibrations in the item selection algorithms and in the computation of examinee ability estimates. The response data from the computer adaptive test administration were analyzed yielding recalibrated item difficulties and examinee ability estimates. Item precalibrations were compared with item recalibrations. Examinee ability estimates obtained using the item precalibrations on the computer adaptive administration were compared with the examinee ability estimates obtained from using the item recalibrations on the computer adaptive administration. The correlation for examinee ability estimates was 0.99 and for item correlations it was 0.90. Some item calibrations shifted but most remained consistent within the limits of error. Item shift, however, did not affect the ordering of examinee ability estimates. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 23 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT. (Contains 1 table and 23 references.) (SLD)

AB  - This paper is an attempt to design and to evaluate the platform-independent computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system, which can expand the diversity of CAT-administering platforms. By using extensible markup language (XML) to describe the item bank, one might find the implementation of CAT on a different platform, such as a personal computer (PC), a personal digital assistant (PDA), and other handheld devices, more convenient. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of a CAT administration platform on precision and efficiency. Fifty senior high school students were selected to take an English vocabulary CAT both on PC and PDA, which enabled them to compare the relevant advantages with the disadvantages of the two different administration platforms firsthand. Both tests used the same-size, well-calibrated item bank, ability estimation algorithm, and item selection strategy. The results indicate that the platforms on which examinees take CAT do not affect the performance of CAT. The responses of the questionnaire on the testing environment also show that most examinees prefer to take the test on PDA. It is concluded that using a PDA to administer CAT is both as precise and effective as a PC and more enjoyable and convenient.

AB  - This study contributes to the orange technology on ML and employee positive emotion in the workplace. We propose that the motivating language (ML), positive emotion, especially the long-term positive emotion on the job generates favorable work outcomes. The current study examines the relationships between leader's ML, employee personality traits, and workplace outcomes in Chinese companies. The mediating effects of employee positive emotion and person-organization fit (P-O fit) in these relationships are also investigated. The results reveal that both ML and conscientiousness are significantly related to positive emotion, both of which play mediating roles in the relationship between ML, conscientiousness, and two of the three workplace outcomes. Test results also show that agreeableness affected all three employee outcomes through the effect of P-O fit.

AB  - The rotor position of a salient-pole permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) at standstill or rotating at low speed is often estimated by measuring the responses on high-frequency test signals. In some drives, the rotor position is computed by measuring important current ripples that are generated by supplying the PMSM periodically with high-frequency voltage test pulses. Besides these ripples, undesired distortions in the average-current samples have been measured. Simulation results have revealed that these distortions are caused by a test signal, as it produces a nonzero voltage deviation from the steady-state stator voltage. In this paper, a low-speed sensorless strategy is discussed where a strong reduction of the aforementioned distortions is obtained by adapting the test signals to the steady-state stator voltage. The main assumption is that an accurate estimation of the steady-state voltage is made by using the controller output. The computation of the adaptive test signals is done by taking into account the voltage restriction of the dc-bus voltage. Simulation results, as well as experimental measurements, indicate the effectiveness of the adaptive test signals in a sensorless controlled interior PMSM.

AB  - E-learning environment is spreading in education process especially adaptive e-learning systems. This approach of learning means that learning content is created and distributed in a very different manner to comply with differences among individuals. Providing personalized content is the major research topic for a huge no. of researchers. And sequentially is Computer adaptive test (CAT). Almost all of (CAT) systems' aim is to measure the examinees' ability to solve the selected questions regardless the quality of the learning process. Their objective is to choose the items which have the high probability to be solved with the current ability estimation. The proposed system aim is to measure the examinees' knowledge outcome in addition to evaluate the course itself in order to improve integrity of learning process pipe lines. Evaluating instructors is not based only on survey forms which may be affected by some good or bad feelings; but it also depends some scientific methods.

AB  - Nonadaptive group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of n items into different pools. Each pool is then tested and defective items are identified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools required to identify at most d defective items. Motivated by applications in network tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of group testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group testing problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a graph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any set of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated with a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to the special case of a complete graph on n vertices. For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained, namely, that the number of tests required to identify d defective items is substantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing problems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if T(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph G, it is shown that with m = O(d2T2(n) log(n/d)) nonadaptive tests, one can identify the defective items. Consequently, for the Erdos-R<c3><a9>nyi random graph G(n, p), as well as expander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that m = O(d2 log3 n) non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify d defective items. Next, a specific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it is shown that m = O(d3 log3 n) nonadaptive tests are sufficient to identify d defective items. Noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing problem are considered, for which parallel results are developed. We also briefly discuss extensions to compressive sensing on graphs.

AB  - Education in the 21st century faces an increasing number of challenges that require intelligent systems. The learning environments of today and tomorrow must handle distributed and dynamically changing content, a geographical dispersion of students and teachers, and generations of learners who spend hours a day interacting with multimillion-dollar multimedia environments. The new learning environments are moving beyond kindergarten through college classrooms to distance learning, lifelong education, and on-the-job training; they're entering the multifaceted universe of virtual worlds and ambient spaces. The articles in this special issue report novel, cutting-edge, intelligent learning environments. The systems not only have intelligent computational architectures but also are empirically tested on humans. Empirical research is of course essential to test system fidelity in delivering the intended pedagogy and to assess learning gains, usability, and learner satisfaction. This article is part of a special issue on intelligent educational systems.

AB  - In recent years, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has been widely used in educational and clinical settings. The basic idea of CAT is relatively straightforward. A computer is used to administer items tailored for individuals to maximize the measurement precision of their proficiency estimates. However, the administration of CAT is not so simple. Those who administer CATs must, while trying to optimize an item selection criterion, consider a variety of practical issues such as test security, content balancing, the purpose of testing, and other test specifications. Such extraneous factors make it possible that a CAT might have so many constraints that in practice it is barely adaptive at all. This concern is at the forefront of the current study, which poses two key questions: How adaptive is a highly adaptive test really? How can the level of adaptation be improved? This study aims to develop three new statistical indicators to measure the amount of adaptation conditional on the examinees' proficiency levels in CAT. It also aims to evaluate the feasibility and utility of these adaptation measures in helping to diagnose and improve adaptivity that occurs during the CAT administration. Extending work done by Reckase, Ju, and Kim (2018), the proposed measures are based on three components<e2><80><94>the differences in the locations between the selected items and the examinee's current proficiency estimates, the variations in the item locations administered to each examinee, and the magnitude of information that the test presents to each examinee. Hence, they can be used to assess adaptivity during the CAT process, as well as to identify differences in the level of adaptation for individuals or subgroups of examinees. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptation indices, this study conducted analyses of real operational testing data from a healthcare licensure examination, as well as comprehensive simulation studies under various conditions that affect adaptivity in a CAT. The key findings of the study suggest that the proposed adaptation indices are likely to function as intended to sensitively detect the magnitude of adaptivity for a CAT over the proficiency continuum. These new measures shed light on how much adaptation of a given test occurs across individual proficiency levels or subpopulations. With some guidelines for the interpretation of these measures recommended in this study, the adaptation indices can also readily serve as diagnostic tools in practice for helping test practitioners design item pools and adaptive tests that support high adaptivity.

AB  - Vocabulary knowledge assessment methods and instruments have gone through a significant evolution. Computer-based tests offer more opportunities than their paper-and-pencil counterparts, however, most digital vocabulary assessments are linear and adaptive solutions in this domain are scarce. The aims of this study were to compare the effectiveness of a multi-stage adaptive and a linear test system of vocabulary knowledge both at test and individual level and to examine the impact of the used assessment method on students' performance and motivation measured through the number of the right answers within a test. Data show that the adaptive test system provided a more accurate ability estimation with higher reliability, a more motivating test environment and more precision than the linear version.

AB  - There has been a notable lack of change in psychological assessment practices over the last several decades despite vast improvements in science and technology. The use of item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) in other testing domains has yielded positive results, but these practices have not gained widespread use in psychological assessment. Research has shown that the item response theory methodology can yield important information about assessments not available to researchers through classical test theory, and computer adaptive testing can result in significant item reductions and shorter test administration times. Thus, the current study evaluated whether a single set of items that measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with differential item functioning less than |+/-0.3| across the three demographic variables of gender, age, and education can be identified. Research has consistently shown that an internalized distress dimension is prevalent in the literature on self-rated mood, as well as in the MMPI-2 item pool. IRT analyses were used to investigate for age, gender, and education bias in a sample of 4,493 participants with 250 participants for most combinations of demographic variables (age [3], education [3], gender [2]). Age, education, and gender bias was most often seen in comparisons for participants in the 60 to 79 year old age group for all three scales. The Welsh Anxiety (A) scale showed the greatest number of items (19) with DIF greater than |+/-0.3|across the three demographic variables. Differential item functioning was most prevalent when there were significant disparities between the two groups being evaluated. Overall, results showed that there were 22 items that were relatively unbiased for each combination of demographic variables. Internalized Distress (ID) had the greatest number of unbiased items across the various combinations of demographic variables, with 19 items showing relatively no bias. These findings indicate that it is possible to develop a computer adaptive assessment to measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with enough items that are free from bias for age, education, and gender. Further exploration of computer-adaptive administration of the MMPI-2 and other self-report inventories seems warranted because of its ability to provide comparable information frequently with considerable time saving for individuals.

AB  - The computer-adaptive multistage testing (ca-MST) has been developed as an alternative to computerized adaptive testing (CAT), and been increasingly adopted in large-scale assessments. Current research and practice only focus on ca-MST panels for credentialing purposes. The ca-MST test mode, therefore, is designed to gauge a single scale. The present study is the first step to investigate ca-MST panels for diagnostic purposes, which involve the assessment of multiple attributes in the same test. This study employed computer simulation to compare multidimensional ca-MST panels and their unidimensional counterparts, and to explore the factors that affect the accuracy and efficiency of multidimensional ca-MST. Nine multidimensional ca-MST panel designs--which differed in configuration and test length--were simulated under varied attribute correlation scenarios. In addition, item pools with different qualities were studied to suggest appropriate item bank design. The comparison between the multidimensional ca-MST and a sequential of unidimensional ca-MST suggested that when attributes correlated moderate to high, employing a multidimensional ca-MST provided more accurate and efficient scoring decisions than several unidimensional ca-MST with IRT scoring. However, a multidimensional ca-MST did not perform better than its unidimensional counterpart with MIRT scoring. Nevertheless, multidimensional panels are still promising for diagnostic purposes given practical considerations. The investigation on multidimensional ca-MST design indicated the following: Higher attribute correlation was associated with better scoring decision because more information carried by a correlation matrix was available for estimation. This held true across all item pool conditions. An optimal item pool would be the one that was discriminative, appropriately located and specifically designed for a configuration. The accuracy and efficiency of a multidimensional ca-MST panel would be diminished if its item pool was too easy, or not informative. According to the results, the 1-2-3 configuration design was most promising. In terms of test length, an appropriate decision would largely depend on the attribute correlation and the item pool characteristics.

AB  - Given the rapid advancement of computer technology, the importance of administering adaptive tests with polytomous items is in great need. With regard to the applicability of adaptive testing using polytomous IRT models, adaptive testing can use polytomous items of either rating scales, or in some testing situations of multiple choice. Additionally, the availability of computerized polytomous scoring of open-ended items enhances such applicability. This need promotes the research in polytomous adaptive testing (PAT). This dissertation is an effort to focus on item selection methods, as a major component, in polytomous computerized adaptive testing. So, it consists of five chapters that cover the following: Chapter 1 focuses on a thorough introduction to the item response theory (IRT) models and adaptive testing related to polytomous items. Such an important overview and introduction to basic concepts in test theory and mathematical models for polytomous items is needed for the flow of consequent chapters. Chapter 2 is devoted to the development of a central location index (LI) to uniquely represent the polytomous item with a scale value parameter using most commonly used polytomous models. The motivation and rationale to search for a central or an overall location parameter is twofold: (a) the confusion of multiple and different parameterizations for a polytomous item even for the same model, and (b) the unavailability of such single location parameter block the usage of certain item selection methods in adaptive testing. Two approaches are used to derive the proposed LIs, one is based on the item category response functions (ICRFs) and the other is based on the polytomous item response function (IRF). As a result, four LIs are proposed. Chapter 3 is particularly assigned to development of an item selection method based on the developed location index and primarily assess its performance in the PAT context relative to existing methods. This method belongs to the non-information based item selection methods and we referred it as Matching-LI method. The results support that this proposed method is promising and is capable to produce accurate ability estimates and successfully manage the item pool usage. Chapter 4 introduces new item selection methods taking in consideration the previous chapter's results. The new methods are the hybrid, stage-based information, polytomous a-stratification methods. The first two methods try to merge more than one criterion for selecting items of each PAT (e.g., the hybrid method merges both the Matching-LI and maximum information (MI) methods). The last method uses Matching-LI method within each stratum. Chapter 5 provides discussion, conclusions, and limitations and future research directions with respect to important components of an adaptive testing program (i.e., item selection methods, item response models, item banks, and trait versus attribute estimation).

AB  - With the rapid growth of computer and mobile technology, it is a challenge to integrate computer based test (CBT) with mobile learning (m-learning) especially for formative assessment and self-assessment. In terms of self-assessment, computer adaptive test (CAT) is a proper way to enable students to evaluate themselves. In CAT, students are assessed through a process that uses item response theory (IRT), a well-founded psychometric theory. Furthermore, a large item bank is indispensable to a test, but when a CAT system has a large item bank, the test item selection of IRT becomes more tedious. Besides the large item bank, item exposure mechanism is also essential to a testing system. However, IRT all lack the above-mentioned points. These reasons have motivated the authors to carry out this study. This paper describes a design issue aimed at the development and implementation of an adaptive testing system. The system can support several assessment functions and different devices. Moreover, the researchers apply a novel approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO) to alleviate the computational complexity and resolve the problem of item exposure. Throughout the development of the system, a formative evaluation was embedded into an integral part of the design methodology that was used for improving the system. After the system was formally released onto the web, some questionnaires and experiments were conducted to evaluate the usability, precision, and efficiency of the system. The results of these evaluations indicated that the system provides an adaptive testing for different devices and supports versatile assessment functions. Moreover, the system can estimate students' ability reliably and validly and conduct an adaptive test efficiently. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the system was alleviated by the PSO approach. By the approach, the test item selection procedure becomes efficient and the average best fitness values are very close to the optimal solutions. (Contains 9 figures and 6 tables.)

AB  - In a randomized experiment (n = 515), a computerized and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) are compared. The item pool consists of 24 polytomous motivation items. Although items are carefully selected, calibration data show that Samejima's graded response model did not fit the data optimally. A simulation study is done to assess possible consequences of model misfit. CAT efficiency was studied by a systematic comparison of the CAT with two types of conventional fixed length short forms, which are created to be good CAT competitors. Results showed no essential administration mode effects. Efficiency analyses show that CAT outperformed the short forms in almost all aspects when results are aggregated along the latent trait scale. The real and the simulated data results are very similar, which indicate that the real data results are not affected by model misfit. (Contains 2 tables, 6 figures and 5 notes.)

AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Korean college students (n=208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (motivated and non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) under the counterbalanced design at the computer laboratory. They were also given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale, a 10-item computer test anxiety scale, and a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing. A multivariate analysis of covariance, with the math aptitude and the test anxiety as covariates, demonstrated that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes.

AB  - The aim of this thesis is to develop realistic expectations about the psychological and psychometric implications of using computerized adaptive tests (CAT). A review is carried out of literature on computerized-based testing (CBT) and CAT. A field study as well as four laboratory experiments were conducted to achieve that goal. The current research strongly suggested the equivalence between the P& P and CAT formats for the Abstract Reasoning (AR) and Mechanical Reasoning (MR) tests of the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), but failed to do so for the Numerical Ability (NA) test. Also, the CAT version of DAT can predict a performance variable as accurately as can the P& P format. Overall, testees' attitudes toward several aspects of computerized testing were positive. The results confirmed the negative relationship between computer experience and computer anxiety. Moreover, knowledge of CAT behaviour negatively affected subjects' performance, but did not increase the level of their state anxiety. This suggested that a form of feedback acts during the adaptive test which has a negative effect on testees' performance and response time. This assumption was confirmed. Subjects spend a shorter time on the subsequent item after negative feedback (wrong) on the previous item than after positive feedback (right). It has been found that although the response time for answering an individual item was higher for CAT format than for P& P format, the CAT version of DAT resulted in a 20% reduction in completion time of the test. Also, the difficulty level of the initial items has a significant effect on testees' overall scores. The findings of this thesis suggest that CAT has numerous advantages and potential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of testing, and has potential areas of future contribution within personnel selection and assessment. This potential can be realized if proper consideration is made in designing, developing, and implementing these testing systems, and if professional standards are maintained by developers and users.

AB  - Advances in the application of item response theory and the availability of powerful microcomputers have made computerized adaptive testing (CAT) a reality. Two issues that need to be considered before large-scale applications of computerized adaptive tests are (1) reliability of CAT scores, and (2) their susceptibility to factors that contaminate test scores. Testwiseness has been shown to have a significant effect on P&P scores. The effects of TW on CAT scores have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of TW on CAT and P&P tests. Reliability of a CAT and a P&P version of a test was also compared. Subjects were 120 students at a large university. Half received TW training as part of their course content; half received no TW training. Subjects were randomly assigned to take a CAT or a P&P math test. They were tested again on the same test after three weeks. They also responded to a questionnaire about their attitudes toward the test and TW strategies they had used. It was hypothesized that TW training would be more effective in improving P&P test scores than CAT scores. Contrary to expectations, results showed no significant effects for TW training. There is evidence to suggest that the group without TW training may have been more testwise than the TW training group initially. Mode effects were significant for test scores (higher on P&P than on CAT) and for attitudes toward the test (more positive toward CAT). Correlation between the two sets of CAT scores was low (.29). Test-retest reliability was high (.81) for the P&P test. The low reliability of CAT in this study may be attributed to the inappropriateness of the difficulty level of the test for the subjects, inconsistencies in subjects' responses due to lack of motivation, and termination of the test at ability estimates greater than 4 or smaller than $-$4. It is suggested that with increased usage of CATs, new test-taking strategies may emerge that are only relevant to the CAT.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to develop, implement, and evaluate the year long project, Microcomputer Adaptive Testing High-Risk Urban Students (MATH-R-US). The project produced diagnostic software to meet the following criteria: (1) help students obtain high school mathematics credit needed for graduation; (2) motivate students to learn mathematics; (3) account for erratic student attendance; and (4) use computer adaptive testing as an integral part of the program. The project was used for an entire school year by a class in an urban high school with an at-risk predominantly black population and a high rate of absenteeism. The tests, which accept generative responses rather than multiple choice answers, were administered once a week in the school's computer lab. The results of each test were saved and practice sheets, with answer keys, were generated for the missed objectives. The program was evaluated to improve implementation and furnish descriptive data to the classroom teachers and school administrators. It was found that the program generated intense student competition to see who could get the most hamburger graphics--which appeared on the screen when students completed a test with 100% accuracy--in an hour. Both males and female students expressed positive attitudes about the course components, but female responses reflected more confidence in their own abilities. Computer math test scores indicated a consistent improvement on retesting of a topic, with 23 perfect scores on 43 retests. A discussion of the implications of this study concludes the paper.

AB  - We conducted an experiment that contrasted a variant of computerized adaptive testing, self-adapted testing, with two traditional tests, a relatively difficult one and a relatively easy one, that were constructed from the same bank of verbal ability items. In a self-adapted test, the examinee, rather than a computerized algorithm, chooses the difficulty of the next item to be presented. Participants completed a self-report of text anxiety and were randomly assigned to take one of the three tests of verbal ability. Analyses of variance using Rasch estimates of ability and the standard error of those estimates as dependent measures demonstrated that the self-adapted test led to higher ability estimates and minimized the effect of test anxiety without any overall loss of measurement precision. Analysis of the item choices in the self-adapted test suggested that, in general, participants chose more difficult items as the test progressed. Anxiety was negatively associated with the difficulty of the initial choice but not associated with the rate of progress to higher difficulty items.

AB  - Single stage and multistage pressuremeter creep tests have been conducted in large, laboratory-prepared samples of polycrystalline ice at temperatures of -2(DEGREES)C. One purpose of the experimental program was to investigate the validity and applicability of two creep theories, the widely used simple power law theory (strain-hardening formulation) and the recently proposed modified second-order fluid model. Another purpose was to investigate the relationship between single stage and multistage pressuremeter creep tests, in the same stress range, and thus to deduce the effect of loading history on the creep parameters. For both models, the creep information obtained from the multistage pressuremeter tests was found to compare very well with the information derived from single stage pressuremeter creep tests, both in terms of creep parameters and predicted long-term behaviour. The modified second-order fluid model, however, produced less scatter in the stress exponent n derived from the multistage tests than the simple power law model. Through analysis of the multistage tests, it appears that the past history of applied stresses in a pressuremeter creep test has little effect on the nature of the creep; rather, the amount of accumulated strain appears to be the controlling factor. For pressuremeter testing in ice or ice-rich frozen soils, it should be assumed that a steady-state creep condition will eventually prevail with continued straining. Each stress increment in a pressuremeter creep test should be applied until at least the steady-state condition is approached, as evidenced by a b (time exponent) of at least 0.90 or an exponentially increasing cavity radius with time. In order to attain the steady-state condition in a reasonable amount of time, a field multistage pressuremeter creep test may be started at any stress level. With carefully run calibrations both before and after each test, the OYO Elastmeter-100 pressuremeter with an electronic radius measuring device performed exceedingly well in this experimental program. Analysis of the results, for the time being, should be conducted in terms of the simple power law creep theory in its steady-state form. Because it can represent both primary and secondary creep in the same motion equation and is valid for large strains, the modified second-order fluid model is preferable to the simple power law model. Solutions to selected boundary-value problems, however, must be solved before it can be used in practice.

AB  - The present monte carlo simulation study was designed to examine the effects of multidimensionality during the administration of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). It was assumed that multidimensionality existed in the individuals to whom test items were being administered, i.e., that the correct or incorrect responses given by an individual were generated from a specified multidimensional structure, rather than the unidimensional item response theory (IRT) model normally assumed to have generated the observable dichotomous test item responses. The dichotomous response was then treated for CAT item selection and ability estimation purposes as if it had been generated by the unidimensional model. To the extent that the observed item response was affected by dimensions other than the first (which corresponded to the single dimension assumed to underlie the item selection and ability estimation process) errors should be introduced into the adaptive testing process. These errors should affect the ability estimates and the efficiency of CAT. The study focused on the nature and degree of these errors under a variety of multidimensional structures, to determine how robust CAT is to the effects of multidimensionality in examinees' responses to test items.

AB  - The effects of a test bias reduction technique on measurement precision in conventional and computer adaptive tests were investigated. Also, the relationships between test type, bias reduction procedures, and examinees' psychological reactions to testing were investigated. Latent trait theory was used in the construction and evaluation of the conventional and adaptive tests which were both administered on a computer terminal. The test items administered in this study were from the Scholastic Aptitude Test verbal section. The adaptive test used a Bayesian sequential item selection strategy to construct individualized 15-item tests for each examinee. The conventional test administered a fixed set of 15 items selected to measure equally well over the entire range of examinee ability. The test bias reduction technique is a three step procedure for selecting items either interactively (adaptive) or a priori (conventional) to be in a test. First, the desired difficulty of the new item is specified. Second, either four or seven items with difficulty levels nearest the desired level are selected from the item pool. Third, the item with the lowest bias is selected to be in the test. The test bias reduction technique substantially reduced the bias index of the items administered to the examinees but also resulted in lower measurement precision of examinee ability. This effect on measurement precision was larger for the conventional test than the adaptive test. The levels of bias reduction, four items scanned for lowest bias compared to seven items scanned, made no difference on the measurement precision of the adaptive test. However, these levels of bias reduction made a difference on the measurement precision of the conventional test. The adaptive test resulted in higher Bayesian modal estimates of ability than those from the conventional test. However, examinees perceived the adaptive test to be more difficult than the conventional test. Examinees' psychological reactions of perceive guessing and perceived performance were affected by the type of test, adaptive or conventional, and were related to test performance independent of examinee ability. Also, the relationship between these psychological reactions and performance was generally greater for conventional than adaptive tests. Therefore, adaptive testing might affect performance scores differently than conventional testing through mediating psychological processes. These findings are discussed in addition to possible directions for future research.

AB  - In educational tests, a group of questions related to a shared stimulus is called a testlet (e.g., a reading passage with multiple related questions). Use of testlets is very common in educational tests. Additionally, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a mode of testing where the test forms are created in real time tailoring to the test taker's previous responses. CATs have gained popularity because they produce a more accurate test score estimate within a shorter time with fewer questions. In this dissertation, the performance of CAT with testlets was studied. Conditional independence is an essential assumption of Item Response Models. However, when testlets are used, item responses to the items in the same testlet may not be independent since these items are associated with a common stimulus. In this case, the conditional independence assumption is violated, and this violation can affect the entire performance of CAT and lead to inaccurate test scores. Common practice for testlet based CATs is to select a testlet adaptively and administer all the items bundled in the testlet. However, the accuracy and efficiency aspects of CAT may not be fully realized with this approach of adaptivity. To increase the accuracy and efficiency in testlet-based CATs, between and within testlet adaptivity was studied. Other manipulated variables were the level of adaptivity, different testlet/item selection approaches, latent trait estimation methods, test length/number of testlets, and magnitude of testlet dependence. The performances of testlet based CATs with various scenarios were evaluated descriptively by running a series of simulations. One of the important findings of the study is that not only between testlets but also within testlets adaptation improved the performance of the CAT for more accurate and precise estimation of the latent traits. The results will serve as a baseline for future research and practice.

AB  - Four-parameter models have received increasing psychometric attention in recent years, as a reduced upper asymptote for item characteristic curves can be appealing for measurement applications such as adaptive testing and person-fit assessment. However, applications can be challenging due to the large number of parameters in the model. In this article, we demonstrate in the context of mathematics assessments how the slip and guess parameters of a four-parameter model may often be empirically related. This observation also has a psychological explanation to the extent that both asymptote parameters may be manifestations of a single item complexity characteristic. The relationship between lower and upper asymptotes motivates the consideration of an asymmetric item response theory model as a three-parameter alternative to the four-parameter model. Using actual response data from mathematics multiple-choice tests, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of a three-parameter asymmetric model in several standardized tests of mathematics. To the extent that a model of asymmetry ultimately portrays slips and guesses not as purely random but rather as proficiency-related phenomena, we argue that the asymmetric approach may also have greater psychological plausibility.

AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD.

AB  - Skeptics of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trend for International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) argue that while US elementary and high school students are behind their peers in other nations, the US workforce is still excellent because of the high quality post-secondary educational institutions in the US. However, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) indicates that US adults are in fact far behind their international peers in literacy, numeracy, and technology-based problem solving. Through the use of data mining, this study explored the possible association between PIAAC scores and several constructs. Since the US, Canada, and New Zealand were considered culturally similar nations, according to cluster analysis, patterns between PIAAC scores and selected constructs were analyzed by a variety of big data analytical methods, including cluster analysis, bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and data visualization. Given that PIAAC used multiple computerized adaptive testing, the consequential plausible values were randomly selected when the ensemble approach was used. Additionally, model comparison was utilized to decide between bagging and boosting in order to select the optimal model for each sample. In these samples, cultural engagement, readiness to learn, and social trust, respectively emerged as strong predictors for learning outcomes as they were assessed by PIAAC.

AB  - Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security Administration's (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood & emotions, resilience, social interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition & communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental health subdomains: Cognition & Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 items), Resilience & Sociability (29 items) and Mood & Emotions (34 items). All scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational rehabilitation settings.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which item response theory (IRT) proficiency estimation methods are robust to the presence of aberrant responses under the "GRE"<c2><ae> General Test multistage adaptive testing (MST) design. To that end, a wide range of atypical response behaviors affecting as much as 10% of the test items were simulated using a generic GRE 2-stage MST and the 2-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model. As expected, some differences were found among the 5 estimators in terms of the recovery of the true theta ability; for example, Bayesian estimators had lower error variance and their estimates were regressed to the mean.Once the IRT theta estimates were scaled onto a comparable reporting score scale, however, it was found that all the estimation methods investigated, including the one currently used to score GRE MSTs, were equally robust under the simulated conditions.

AB  - We propose a novel group testing framework, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome screening experiments in addition to other applications such as interpretable rule learning for decision making. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an integer-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a unifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing models are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the notion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable test matrices, representing generalizations of classical disjunct and separable matrices. We describe combinatorial and probabilistic constructions for such matrices without considering any restriction on the thresholds of the SQGT model (i.e. SQGT with arbitrary thresholds). Then, we focus on the important special case in which the thresholds are equidistant, and construct SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable matrices for this model. While for most of the constructions described in this dissertation, it is assumed that the number of defectives is much smaller than total number of test subjects, we also consider the case in which there is no restriction on the number of defectives and they may be as large as the total number of subjects. For the constructed matrices, we describe a number of efficient decoding algorithms based on algebraic methods and message passing on graphical models. Finally, we introduce the novel probabilistic group testing framework of Poisson group testing, applicable to dynamic testing with diminishing relative rates of defectives. For this new model, we consider both nonadaptive and adaptive testing schemes and develop lower bounds and tight constructive upper bounds on the number of required tests.

AB  - The major concerns of adaptive testing studies have concentrated on effectiveness and efficiency of the system built for the research experiments. It has been criticised that such general information has fallen short of providing qualitative descriptions regarding learning performance. Takahiro Sato of Japan proposed an analytical diagram called Student-Problem Chart (S-P Chart) in the 1970. The S-P Chart is able to establish a learning diagnostic table which comments student learning performance in a verbal form. The advancement of computer technology has made the S-P analytical process more applicable for school teachers. This study examined how online comments provided by the S-P diagnostic table could affect the students' learning attitude. One hundred sixth grade students were selected to be the subjects of the study. An online embedded test was given to the subjects and an S-P diagnostic table was drawn by the computer to display instant comments on each student's learning performance. A Questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews were performed after the experiment. Results indicated that students liked the online qualitative comments. This is because students were able to instantly understand why they performed well/poor in the test, which is much beyond the numerical scores can explain. The results also showed that the online S-P diagnostic table made students more circumspect on answering the test questions in order to reduce careless mistakes. Students would also be more likely to review what they missed on the test. However, the S-P comment table seemed to have no effect on improving their learning performance. An online iterative drilling platform was consequently built to incorporate with the S-P diagnostic process to assist poorly performed students. It may effectively work with the S-P diagnostic process to provide constructive remediation for the students who exhibited a poor performance on the S-P chart.

AB  - Semiconductor technology scaling has long been a source of dramatic gains in our computing capabilities. However, as we test the physical limits of silicon feature size, serious reliability and computational efficiency challenges confront us. The supply voltage levels have practically stagnated, resulting in increasing power densities and operating temperatures. Given that most semiconductor wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Further, the rise in power density is also limiting the number of resources that can be kept active on chip simultaneously, motivating the need for energy-efficient computing. In this landscape of technological challenges, incremental architectural improvements to existing designs are likely insufficient, motivating a need to rethink the architectural fabric from the ground up. Towards this end, this thesis presents adaptive architecture and compiler solutions that can effectively tackle reliability, performance and energy-efficiency demands expected in future microprocessors. For the reliability challenge, we present StageNet, a highly reconfigurable multicore architecture that is designed as a network of pipeline stages, rather than isolated cores. The interconnection flexibility in StageNet allows it to adaptively route around defective pieces of a processor, and deliver graceful performance degradation in the face of failures. We further complement the fault isolation ability of StageNet with an adaptive testing framework that significantly reduces the overhead of in-field fault detection. As a second contribution, we build upon the interconnection flexibility of StageNet to develop a unified performance-reliability solution. This subsequent design, named CoreGenesis, relies on a set of microarchitectural innovations and compiler hints to merge processor cores for a higher single-thread performance. This enables customization of processing ability (narrow or wide-issue pipelines) to the dynamic workload requirements. In the final work of this thesis, we investigate the sources of computational inefficiency in general purpose processors, and propose a configurable compute engine, named BERET, for substantial energy savings. The insight here is to cut down on the redundant instruction fetch, decode and register file access energy by optimizing the execution of recurring instruction sequences.

AB  - Bayesian graphical models are commonly used to build student models from data. A number of standard algorithms are available to train Bayesian models from student skills assessment data. These models can assess student knowledge and skills from a few observations. They are useful for Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), for example, where the test items can be administered in order to maximize the information they will provide. In practice, such data often contain missing values and, under some circumstances, missing values far outnumber observed values. However, when collecting data from test results, one can often choose which values will be present or missing by a consequent test design. We study how to optimize the choice of test items for collecting the data that will be used for training a Bayesian CAT model, such as to maximize the predictive performance of the model. We explore the use of a simple heuristic for test item choice based on the level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of an item is derived from its initial probability of success and, thus, from its difficulty. The results show that this choice does affect model performance and that the heuristic can lead to better performance. Although the study<e2><80><99>s results are more exploratory than conclusive, they suggest interesting research avenues.

AB  - This study examined the amount of time spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items. Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels. A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners<e2><80><99> manual.

AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

AB  - This study describes the effects of manipulating item difficulty in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment. There are many potential benefits when using CATS as compared to traditional tests. These include increased security, shorter tests, and more precise measurement. According to IRT, the theory underlying CAT, as the computer continually recalculates ability, items that match that current estimate of ability are administered. Such items provide maximum information about examinees during the test. Herein, however, lies a potential problem. These optimal CAT items result in an examinee having only a 50% chance of a correct response. Some examinees may consider such items unduly challenging. Further, when test anxiety is a factor, it is possible that test scores may be negatively affected. This research was undertaken to determine the effects of administering easier CAT items on ability estimation and test length using computer simulations. Also considered was the administration of different numbers of initial items prior to the start of the adaptive portion of the test, using three different levels of measurement precision. Results indicate that regardless of the number of initial items administered, the level of precision employed, or the modifications made to item difficulty, the approximation of estimated ability to true ability is good in all cases. Additionally, the standard deviations of the ability estimates closely approximate the theoretical levels of precision used as stopping rules for the simulated CATs. Since optimal CAT items are not used, each item administered provides less information about examinees than optimal CAT items. This results in longer tests. Fortunately, using easier items that provide up to a 66.4% chance of a correct response results in tests that only modestly increase in length, across levels of precision. For larger standard errors, even easier items (up to a 73.5% chance of a correct response) result in only negligible to modest increases in test length. Examinees who find optimal CAT items difficult or examinees with test anxiety may find CATs that implement easier items enhance the already existing benefits of CAT.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly using novel tools (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in designing selection systems. While there is great interest in using these tools, there is little research to indicate how applicants react to them. As applicant reactions have been shown to affect a number of variables important to organizations (e.g., test fairness, job acceptance, productivity, recommendation intentions), it is important to understand what determines these reactions. A framework was developed to highlight a number of antecedents to, types of, and consequences of reactions to novel testing. The current study has a 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil - computerized) x 2 (perceived technical level of the job: high technical job - low technical job) x 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design. While test-takers' post-test perceptions do not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, factors such as computer anxiety and experience were shown to be important factors in determining success in the selection process. Results show the significant relationships between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing novel selection tools in an applicant setting.

AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an item response theory (IRT). Additionally this study examined the effect of repeated practice with ACCUPLACER on subsequent ACCUPLACER and COMPASS scores. General opinions of students toward ACCUPLACER and COMPASS and correlations between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and paper-and-pencil (P&P) formats were investigated. Methods. The investigator sampled 517 ACCUPLACER tests in order to develop a large number of response patterns and scores. This data source was used to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers and consistency between item response patterns and test scores in ACCUPLACER. This study employed seven classes of developmental mathematics; specifically, three classes were the experimental group and four classes comprised the control group. As treatment, students from the experimental group practiced the ACCUPLACER four times during the quarter. Students from all seven classes took the preACCUPLACER, postACCUPLACER, preCOMPANION, postCOMPANION, postCOMPASS, and Developmental Final Examinations. All students responded to the Opinionnaires of the ACCUPLACER and COMPASS. Scores on SAT-Math, SAT-Verbal, and Collegiate Placement Examination were obtained from students' records. Results. Test questions generated from all correct responses and test questions generated from all incorrect responses were disjoint. Starter questions were found to be moderately easy rather than average difficulty. Six of the twelve items were identical and appeared in the same position on many initially correct response patterns. Lower scores came from initially incorrect response patterns. Scores varied greatly within the same response pattern when different sequences of items were given. A total of 108 different items were found, not the expected 214 items. Several starter questions appeared as later items in tests with primarily incorrect responses. Some correlations between CAT and P&P formats were significant $(p < .05).$ Students found that instructions and graphics were unclear on CATs. Conclusions. The results of this study are not consistent with five of the purported claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an IRT framework. Several sets of scores within the same response pattern widely varied. Repeated practice on a CAT did not affect subsequent CAT scores. Correlations between CAT and P&P formats indicate that one format of testing is not a good predictor of the other form of testing. Remedial students find CATs difficult to understand.

AB  - Procedures based on item response theory (IRT) are widely accepted for solving various measurement problems which cannot be solved using classical test theory (CTT) procedures. The desirable features of dichotomous IRT models over CTT are well known and have been documented by Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991). However, dichotomous IRT models are inappropriate for situations where items need to be scored in more than two categories. For example, in performance assessments, most of the scoring rubrics for performance assessment require scoring of examinee's responses in ordered categories. In addition, polytomous IRT models are useful for assessing an examinee's partial knowledge or levels of mastery. However, the successful application of polytomous IRT models to practical situations depends on the availability of reasonable and well-behaved estimates of the parameters of the models. Therefore, in this study, the behavior of estimators of parameters in polytomous IRT models were examined. In the first study, factors that affected the accuracy, variance, and bias of the marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimators in the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) were investigated. Overall, the results of the study showed that the MML estimators of the parameters of the GPCM, as obtained through the computer program, PARSCALE, performed well under various conditions. However, there was considerable bias in the estimates of the category parameters under all conditions investigated. The average bias did not decrease when sample size and test length increased. The bias contributed to large RMSE in the estimation of category parameters. Further studies need to be conducted to study the effect of bias in the estimates of parameters on the estimation of ability, the development of item banks, and on adaptive testing based on polytomous IRT models. In the second study, the effectiveness of Bayesian procedures for estimating parameters in the GPCM was examined. The results showed that Bayes procedures provided more accurate estimates of parameters with small data sets. Priors on the slope parameters, while having only a modest effect on the accuracy of estimation of slope parameters, had a very positive effect on the accuracy of estimation of the step difficulty parameters.

AB  - The relationship between several individual difference variables and test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was studied with 208 South Korean college students. The general individual difference variable selected was test anxiety, and the math-related individual difference variables were mathematics aptitude, math test anxiety, and math self-concept. Computer-related individual difference variables were computer literacy, computer anxiety, and computer experience. The CAT was an algebra test. Test anxiety and other individual difference variables were measured with instruments translated into Korean for the study. The seven difference variables and their squares were submitted to an analysis using the RSQUARE Procedure from Statistical Analysis System software. Math aptitude, math self-concept, math test anxiety, and computer literacy, in that order, were significantly related to test performance using CAT, but test anxiety, computer experience, and computer anxiety were not. Results suggest that the relationship between individual difference variables and test performance using CAT may be curvilinear. Two tables present analysis results. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

AB  - This research investigates the extent to which linguistic features of standardized test antonym items can be used to predict the empirical difficulty of these items. The study was motivated by both theoretical and practical considerations. Theoretically, exploring content-feature correlates of difficulty is a form of construct validation as such inquiry attends to the question of why an item is easy or difficult. The pursuit of evidential links between content and difficulty is a scientific, falsifiable approach to validation. In contrast, conventional response-based analyses do not address the central role played by item content in controlling difficulty. From a practical standpoint, detecting content-based predictors allows for the scaling of similarly constructed items without having to establish difficulty measurements via pretesting. Twelve variables associated with stem and keyed answer words of 975 published SAT antonym items are considered. Results reveal that the stem word's standard frequency index (SFI) is the most robust predictor of empirical difficulty (as measured by Educational Testing Service's equated delta statistic), distantly followed by the keyed answer word's SFI and part of speech. Across all items, one-third of difficulty variance was explained by this predictor set, confirming the frequency-difficulty relationship reported in studies employing more common words and smaller samples. Prediction was attenuated by the relatively high proportion of words having low frequencies. Presumably, a larger representation of familiar words and more differentiated low frequency values would significantly improve prediction. These findings suggest that feature-based scaling is an efficient, cost effective means for advancing local development of adaptive assessment systems. A computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system is suggested as one practical, psychometric application of the study's findings. The proposed system would extract verbal stimuli from an electronic word domain and employ the aforementioned word variables as proxies for vocabulary item difficulty. Among the design issues discussed are the automatic construction of vocabulary items, adaptive branching, sequential decision-making, iterative refinement of item calibrations, and the provision of timely output for formative direction of learning and instruction.

AB  - Stress-strain curves, generated through continuous and multistage torsion tests of as-cast and homogenized 301, 304, 316 and 317 $\gamma$ stainless steels in the range of 1200-900$\sp\circ$C and 0.1 to 5.0 s$\sp{\rm -1}$, were analyzed with respect to the characteristics of work hardening, dynamic and static recovery, dynamic and static recrystallization, and ductility. Work hardening was related to the Kocks-Mecking analysis. The associated enthalpy which rose across the deformation range attaining a maximum at the highest temperature, was in close agreement with the constant activation energy determined by sinh analysis. Dynamic softening mechanisms were analyzed through examination of the flow curves, with conclusions based upon mechanical data being confirmed by optical metallographic methods. Upon attaining a critical strain, dynamic recrystallization DRX was initiated, producing a peak and then softening to a steady state regime. The rate of dynamic softening was determined by means of the Avrami equation. The critical stress and strain for subgrain formation and for DRX were determined from changes in slope of the strain hardening-flow stress $\theta$-$\sigma$ curves. A transition from multiple peak grain coarsening to single peak grain refinement behavior was observed and analyzed. Static restorative mechanisms were examined by mechanical metallographic methods. Fractional softening was due to both static recovery SRV and static recrystallization SRX. The kinetics were analyzed through use of the Avrami equation. At low strains, the time for 50% SRX was a strong function of strain to the $-2$ power. In addition, the temperature compensated time for SRX depended upon the three-eights power of the Zener-Hollomon parameter for both isothermal and declining temperature T multistage tests. Simulation of a cross country mill showed that multistage flow curves increased as strain rate rose and as interval time and T declined, particularly below 1050$\sp\circ$C. Since the time between successive planetary rolls is insufficient for any restorative mechanisms to operate, the instantaneous power requirements for the planetary hot rolling mill were determined from continuous flow curves. The results favorably agreed with similar mills installed in both Canada and Japan.

AB  - This study focused on the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in remedial mathematics when compared with tutoring and independent-study as methods of instruction. In this investigation, the relationship between these three methods of instruction and the ethnicity of the subjects was explored. Results were measured by analyzing differences in achievement scores as measured by Computer Adaptive Testing and Comparative Guidance Placement. The results showed that there was a significant difference between minority and non-minorities for both tutoring and independent-study. Such differences are frequently encountered and are generally attributable to cultural differences or prior educational experiences, which may cause some minority students to experience emotional and value conflicts in the classroom. This could result in psychological defenses being called into play. No significant differences in test scores were apparent between minorities and non-minorities when using CAI as the method of instruction, indicating that CAI may not activate such defenses. Results also showed that minorities scored significantly higher in testing after using CAI as a method of instruction than after using tutoring or independent-study methods. This suggests that CAI, when used for remedial instruction in basic skills mathematics, reduces the frequently encountered differences in achievement between minorities and non-minorities. This supports the theory that CAI is multicultural and a value-neutral tool that can assist to alleviate some of these pre-existing problems, thereby enabling minority students to attain greater academic success.

AB  - Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) Scientific Standards and refined through factor analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI<e2><80><99>s psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI<e2><80><99>s structure and psychometric properties. Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences. Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

AB  - Concussion is an increasingly recognized public health concern. Proper assessment and management of concussion are critical factors in mitigating adverse effects associated with this injury. Neuropsychological assessment has demonstrated utility in identifying cognitive symptoms related to concussion and monitoring their resolution. Early methods involved administering paper and pencil tests to appraise cognitive domains thought to be most affected by concussion. As interest in concussion and methods of assessment evolved, baseline testing became an integral component of assessment in sport-related concussion (SRC). Baseline testing consists of administering a healthy, or non-injured, individual a battery of cognitive tests that subsequently serve as a reference point to evaluate the individual<e2><80><99>s performance on the same tests following a suspected injury or change in cognitive status. Recent advances, spurred by an interest in increasing access to baseline testing, contributed to the adoption of computerized neurocognitive tests (CNTs). CNTs allow for baseline testing of groups of individuals, in one setting, and in a short amount of time. Immediate Post Concussion and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) has emerged as the most commonly used CNT in the assessment and management of SRC. This body of research aimed to explore ImPACT<e2><80><99>s reliability and validity to appraise its efficacy in accurately detecting cognitive change associated with concussion and explore potential improvements. The first chapter is devoted to examining ImPACT<e2><80><99>s test-retest reliability, which refers to the expected consistency in results over time in healthy individuals. This study examines ImPACT score reports for 107 healthy individuals that included testing at two time points. Results reveal less than adequate test-retest reliability attributable to, at least in part, a restricted range of possible scores, or the presence of a ceiling effect, on numerous subscales. Additional discussion includes corrective measures, such as proactively identifying individuals producing maximum scores on baseline testing, extending the length of subscales, and incorporating adaptive testing. The second chapter evaluates ImPACT<e2><80><99>s validity, and specifically, its classification accuracy in differentiating between individuals with and without concussion. This study incorporates a novel approach through its use of standardized regression based (SRB) reliable change index (RCI) scores to measure post-injury testing deviations from baseline scores. The SRB methodology, coupled with discriminant function analyses (DFAs), is compared to current interpretive procedures. The study includes 129 individuals without concussion whose SRB RCI scores are compared to 81 individuals with concussion. Results of analyses suggest that the current interpretive procedure performs at a chance level in accurately identifying individuals with concussion; conversely, the SRB method and DFA approach yield positive predictive values exceeding 80%, however sensitivities below 50%. Additionally, the Post Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), a self-report measure of symptoms, is largely equivalent to ImPACT<e2><80><99>s cognitive measures in classification accuracy. Collectively, these results raise considerable concern regarding ImPACT<e2><80><99>s efficacy as a measure to aid in the assessment and management of concussion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Legacy hip outcome measures may be burdensome to patients and sometimes yield floor or ceiling effects. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) allow for low-burden data capture and limited ceiling and floor effects. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PROMIS CAT domains demonstrate correlation against commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The authors hypothesized the following: (1) PROMIS CAT scores based on physical function (PF), pain interference (PIF), pain behavior, and pain intensity would show strong correlation with the following legacy scores: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12), Hip Outcome Score (HOS) Sports and Activities of Daily Living subscales, and Veterans RAND-6D (VR-6D) utility measure. (2) The mental and physical health portions of the VR-6D legacy measure would show weak correlation with mental- and psychosocial-specific PROMIS elements-depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. (3) All PROMIS measures would exhibit fewer floor and ceiling effects than legacy scores. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Prospective data were collected on 125 patients in the hip preservation clinics. Enrollees completed legacy scores (visual analog scale for pain, mHHS, iHOT-12, HOS, and VR-6D) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (PF, PIF, pain behavior, anxiety, depression, sleep, social roles and activities, pain intensity, fatigue). Spearman rank correlations were calculated, with r(s) values of 0 to 0.3 indicating negligible correlation; 0.3 to 0.5, weak correlation; 0.5 to 0.7, moderately strong correlation; and >0.7, strong correlation. Floor and ceiling effects were evaluated. RESULTS: As anticipated, the PF-CAT yielded strong correlations with the iHOT-12, mHHS, HOS-Sports, HOS-Activities of Daily Living, and VR-6D, with r(s) values of 0.76, 0.71, 0.81, 0.87, and 0.71, respectively. The PIF-CAT was the only pain score to show moderately strong to strong correlation with all 14 patient-reported outcome measures. A strong correlation was observed between the VR-6D and the social roles and activities CAT ( r(s) = 0.73). The depression CAT had a significant floor effect at 19%. No additional floor or ceiling effect was present for any other legacy or PROMIS measure. CONCLUSION: The PF-CAT shows strong correlation with legacy patient-reported outcome scores among patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The PIF-CAT also correlates strongly with legacy and PROMIS measures evaluating physical and mental well-being. PROMIS measures are less burdensome and demonstrate no floor or ceiling effects, making them a potential alternative to legacy patient-reported outcome measures for the hip.

AB  - The influence of elevated fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of fearavoidance on recovery of functional status during rehabilitation for people with shoulder impairments. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted. Data were collected from 3,362 people with musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder receiving rehabilitation. At intake and discharge, upperextremity function was measured using the shoulder Computerized Adaptive Test. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale. Completion rate at discharge was 57% for function and 47% for pain intensity. A single-item screen was used to classify patients into groups with low versus elevated fear-avoidance beliefs at intake. A general linear model (GLM) was used to describe how change in function is affected by fear avoidance in 8 disease categories. This study also accounted for within-clinic correlation and controlled for other important predictors of functional change in functional status, including various demographic and healthrelated variables. The parameters of the GLM and their standard errors were estimated with the weighted generalized estimating equations method. Functional change was predicted by the interaction between fear and disease categories. On further examination of 8 disease categories using GLM adjusted for other confounders, improvement in function was greater for the low fear group than for the elevated fear group among people with muscle, tendon, and softtissue disorders (<ce><b4>=1.37, P <.01) and those with osteopathies, chondropathies, and acquired musculoskeletal deformities (<ce><b4>=5.52, P<.02). These differences were below the minimal detectable change. Information was not available on whether therapists used information on level of fear to implement treatment plans. The influence of fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status varies among specific shoulder impairments.

AB  - Test equating allows direct comparison of test scores from alternative forms measuring the same construct by employing equating procedures to put the test scores on the same metric. Three equating procedures are commonly used in the literature including the concurrent calibration method, the linking separate calibration methods (e.g. the moment methods and the characteristic curve methods), and FPC (Fixed Parameter Calibration) method. The first two types of methods for traditional IRT model have been well developed. FPC is being emphasized recently because of its utility for constructing item bank and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). However, there are few studies that examine the equating accuracy of the FPC method compared to that of the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method. The equating methods for the traditional IRT model are not appropriate for linking testlet-based tests because the local independence assumption of IRT model cannot be held for this type of tests. Some measurement models, such as testlet response model, bi-factor model, and Rasch testlet model, were advanced to calibrate the models for the testlet-based tests. Few equating methods, however, that take into consideration the additional local dependence among the examinees' responses to items within testlets have been developed for linking testelet-based tests. To address the need to better understand the FPC method and to develop new equating methods for linking testlet-based tests, the studies were to compare the effectiveness of the three types of equating methods under different linking situations and to develop equating methods for linking testlet-based tests. Besides the equating methods concerned, other factors, including sample size, ability distribution, and characteristics of common items and testlets that might affect equating results were also considered. Three simulation studies were carried out to accomplish the research purposes. The first study compared the equating accuracies of the FPC, the linking separate calibration, and the concurrent calibration method based on the IRT model to equate item parameters under different conditions. The results indicated that the FPC method using BILOG-MG performed as well as the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method for linking the equivalent groups. However, the FPC method produced larger equating errors than the other two methods did when the ability distributions of the base and target groups were substantially nonequivalent. Differences in difficulties between the common items set and the total test did not substantially affect the equating results with the three methods, with other conditions being held equal. As expected, both small sample size and less number of common items led to slight greater equating errors. The second study developed an item characteristic curve method and a testlet characteristic curve method for the testlet response model to transform the scale of item parameters. It then compared the effectiveness of the characteristic curve methods and the concurrent calibration methods under different conditions in linking item parameters from alternate test forms which were composed of dichotomously scored testlet-based items. The newly developed item characteristic curve method and the testlet characteristic curve method were shown to perform similarly as or even better than the Stocking-Lord test characteristic curve method and the concurrent calibration method did. Ignoring the local dependence in model calibration substantially increased equating errors. And larger testlet variances for the common testlets led to greater equating errors. The last study used the concurrent calibration method under the multidimensional Rasch testlet model to link the testlet-based tests in which the testlets were composed of dichotomous, polytomous, and mixed-format items. The results demonstrated that the concurrent calibration method under the Rasch testlet model worked well in recovering the underlying item parameters. Again, equating errors were substantially increased if the local dependences were ignored in model calibration. And smaller testlet variances for the common testlets led to more accurate equating results. The results of the studies contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of the different equating methods, particularly those for linking testlet-based tests. They also help clarify influences of the other factors, such as characteristics of the examinees, features of the common items and common testlets on equating results. Testing practitioners and researchers may draw useful recommendations from the findings about equating method selection. Nevertheless, generalizations of the findings from the simulated studies to practical testing programs should be cautious.

AB  - In a series of articles in this issue, Allen proposes and tests a model of movement1; reports the validity and reliability of a self-report instrument, the Movement Ability Measure (MAM)2; and tests the responsiveness to change of the MAM on a small sample of patients.3 The multidimensional model of movement-which includes flexibility, strength, accuracy, speed, adaptability, and endurance-specifies the term "movement" at the human, not cellular or molecular, level for the Movement Continuum Theory.4 As noted in Allen's discussion and in the invited commentaries by Cott and Finch, Martin, and Sullivan, the proposed model of movement has limitations, and the assessment tool has not been tested sufficiently to indicate that it is superior to other instruments such as the Outpatient Physical Therapy Improvement in Movement Assessment Log (OPTIMAL)5 or the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) "item bank" and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) assessment platform (AMPAC-CAT).6 It is clear that we are in the initial rather than final stages of consensus about an instrument that measures outcomes affected by physical therapy intervention and that crosses medical diagnoses, systems, practice settings, acuity, and other variables.

AB  - Self-adapted testing has been described as a variation of computerized adaptive testing that reduces test anxiety and thereby enhances test performance. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of these proposed effects of self-adapted tests (SATs); meta-analysis procedures were used to estimate differences between SATs and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in proficiency estimates and post-test anxiety levels across studies in which these two types of tests have been compared. After controlling for measurement error the results showed that SATs yielded proficiency estimates that were 0.12 standard deviation units higher and post-test anxiety levels that were 0.19 standard deviation units lower than those yielded by CATs. The authors speculate about possible reasons for these differences and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using SATs in operational settings.

AB  - Background: The importance of reading motivation has led to the development of a large number of self-report reading motivation measures; however, there is still a need for a usable measure of adolescent reading motivation that captures a large number of theoretically and empirically distinct constructs. Methods: The current paper details the development and validation of a computer adapted measure of reading motivation, the Adaptive Reading Motivation Measure (ARMM), which assesses constructs of curiosity, involvement, interest, value, challenge, grades, recognition, competition, avoidance, self-efficacy, perceived difficulty, preference for autonomy, social motivation, prosocial goals, and antisocial goals for reading. Results: Model fit indicated that hierarchical multidimensional models fit better than models without a hierarchical structure. The validation results indicate that females scored higher than males and younger students scored higher than older students on most ARMM scores when scores were derived using a higher-order model. In addition, these scores correlated significantly to reading behavior, engagement, and achievement and indicated high reliability. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the ARMM would be a valid measure to assess a large number of reading motivation constructs in a short period of time within a classroom setting. [The paper will be published in "Journal of Research in Reading."]

AB  - This study examined the utility of response time-based analyses in understanding the behavior of unmotivated test takers. For the data from an adaptive achievement test, patterns of observed rapid-guessing behavior and item response accuracy were compared to the behavior expected under several types of models that have been proposed to represent unmotivated test taking behavior. Test taker behavior was found to be inconsistent with these models, with the exception of the effort-moderated model. Effort-moderated scoring was found to both yield scores that were more accurate than those found under traditional scoring, and exhibit improved person fit statistics. In addition, an effort-guided adaptive test was proposed and shown by a simulation study to alleviate item difficulty mistargeting caused by unmotivated test taking.

This article describes types of conative feedback that can support the student's conation, will, volition, or motivation. Any of these types of feedback can be presented to the student before, during, or after an educational activity or a test question. Experimental results found higher student scores using conative feedback during computer-based assessment than without feedback. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - Computerized adaptive (CA) testing uses an algorithm to match examinee ability to item difficulty, while self-adapted (SA) testing allows the examinee to choose the difficulty of his or her items. Research comparing SA and CA testing has shown that examinees experience lower anxiety and improved performance with SA testing. All previous research concerning SA testing has presented item feedback to the examinee before asking the examinee to choose the next item difficulty level. Moreover, item feedback has typically not been presented to examinees in previous CA testing research. The effects of presenting, versus withholding, item feedback in SA tests were studied for 135 graduate and 228 undergraduate students (128 males and 235 females). The instrument was a computerized algebra test to assess skills needed for a statistics class. Examinees administered the SA tests tended to obtain significantly higher ability estimates than did those who were administered the CA tests. Also, those taking the SA tests reported significantly lower post-test state anxiety than did those taking the CA tests. Interaction between test type and feedback was not found, suggesting that examinees are able to use the implicit feedback they receive when answering items. Five tables present study findings. (SLD)

AB  - Volunteer college students were assigned to one of six computer administered vocabulary tests, one half with immediate knowledge of results (KR) after responding to each item, and the other half without knowledge of results. The six tests were designed to be at one of three levels of difficulty and consisted either of 50 preselected items (conventional testing) or tailored on the basis of previous candidate responses (stradaptive testing). Results indicated that the mean maximum-likelihood estimates of individuals' ability varied as a joint function of the KR condition and of test difficulty. Students in the KR condition scored higher than the other students on the most difficult test and lower on the least difficult test. Questionnaire results indicated that, although the students perceived the differences in test difficulty, there were not shown to be any effects on mean student anxiety or motivation scores attributable to test difficulty alone. Students in general reacted very favorably to receiving immediate knowledge of results and its provision increased the mean level of reported motivation. (Author/CTM)

AB  - Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare, neurological genetic disorder for which no clinical outcomes assessments (COAs) or conceptual models (CM) have been developed. Objective: This study aimed to identify symptoms and impacts relevant and important in this patient population and develop a conceptual model of AS, and to evaluate the content validity of selected COA instruments with potential for inclusion in clinical studies of AS to capture treatment benefit. Methods: For both concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive interviews (CI), caregivers of children, adolescents, and adults with AS and clinicians with AS experience were targeted. For CI, clinicians discussed the Modified Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (MPOMA-G) and ProtoKinetics Zeno Walkway<e2><84><a2> and caregivers reviewed the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT), the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS), the Aberrant Behavior Checklist<e2><80><93>Community (ABC-C), and the Morning Diary. Results: Four clinicians and 34 caregivers participated in CE interviews; three clinicians and 36 caregivers participated in CI. A conceptual model, initially informed by literature, was refined based on interview data. Five domains of symptoms, signs, and characteristics of AS were identified: cognitive and executive functioning, social-emotional, emotional-expressive behavior, sensory-compulsive behavior, and physical. Patient impacts were identified in three domains: activities of daily living, school, and social/community. Caregiver impacts were identified in five domains: mental health, physical health, work, home, and social. While all instruments demonstrated the ability to provide relevant data for the AS population, each instrument either contained some items irrelevant to individuals with AS or was missing important concepts based on the interviews. No single instrument covered all relevant domains specific to AS. Conclusion: Future work should consider the adaptation of existing COAs and the development of a novel AS-specific instrument for use in clinical research to ensure outcomes important to this patient population are captured.

AB  - Multidimensional-Method A (M-Method A) has been proposed as an efficient and effective online calibration method for multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) (Chen & Xin, Paper presented at the 78th Meeting of the Psychometric Society, Arnhem, The Netherlands, 2013). However, a key assumption of M-Method A is that it treats person parameter estimates as their true values, thus this method might yield erroneous item calibration when person parameter estimates contain non-ignorable measurement errors. To improve the performance of M-Method A, this paper proposes a new MCAT online calibration method, namely, the full functional MLE-M-Method A (FFMLE-M-Method A). This new method combines the full functional MLE (Jones & Jin in Psychometrika 59:59<e2><80><93>75, 1994; Stefanski & Carroll in Annals of Statistics 13:1335<e2><80><93>1351, 1985) with the original M-Method A in an effort to correct for the estimation error of ability vector that might otherwise adversely affect the precision of item calibration. Two correction schemes are also proposed when implementing the new method. A simulation study was conducted to show that the new method generated more accurate item parameter estimation than the original M-Method A in almost all conditions.

AB  - Background Academic dishonesty (AD) and trustworthy assessment (TA) are fundamental issues in the context of an online assessment. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have explored AD and TA issues in online assessment practice. Objectives Hence, this research aimed at investigating the latest findings regarding AD forms, factors affecting AD and TA, and solutions to reduce AD and increase TA to maintain the quality of online assessment. Methods We reviewed 52 articles in Scopus and Web of Science databases from January 2017 to April 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses model as a guideline to perform a systematic literature review that included three stages, namely planning, conducting, and reporting. Results and conclusions Our review found that there were different forms of AD among students in online learning namely plagiarism, cheating, collusion, and using jockeys. Individual factors such as being lazy to learn, lack of ability, and poor awareness as well as situational factors including the influence of friends, the pressure of the courses, and ease of access to information were strongly associated with AD. A technologybased approach such as using plagiarismchecking software, multiartificial intelligence (AI) in a learning management system, computer adaptive tests, and online proctoring as well as pedagogicalbased approaches, such as implementing a research ethics course programme, and a redesign assessment form such as oralbased and dynamic assessment to reduce cheating behaviour and also sociocultural and sociotechnical adjustment related to the online assessment are reported to reduce AD and increase TA. Implications Educators should adjust the design of online learning and assessment methods as soon as possible. The identified gaps point towards unexplored study on AI, machine learning, learning analytics tools, and related issues of AD and TA in K12 education could motivated future work in the field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve measurement precision, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is developing an item bank for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of emotional functioning (EF). The item bank will be within the conceptual framework of the widely used EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ-C30). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: On the basis of literature search and evaluations by international samples of experts and cancer patients, 38 candidate items were developed. The psychometric properties of the items were evaluated in a large international sample of cancer patients. This included evaluations of dimensionality, item response theory (IRT) model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), and of measurement precision/statistical power. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 1,023 cancer patients from four countries. The evaluations showed that 24 items could be included in a unidimensional IRT model. DIF did not seem to have any significant impact on the estimation of EF. Evaluations indicated that the CAT measure may reduce sample size requirements by up to 50% compared to the QLQ-C30 EF scale without reducing power. CONCLUSION: On the basis of thorough psychometric evaluations, we have established an EF item bank of 24 items. This will allow for more precise and flexible measurement of EF, while maintaining backward compatibility with the QLQ-C30 EF scale.

AB  - This book presents the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in test development. In particular, it includes research and successful examples of using AI technology in automated item generation, automated test assembly, automated scoring, and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). By utilizing artificial intelligence, the efficiency of item development, test form construction, test delivery, and scoring could be dramatically increased. Chapters on automated item generation offer different perspectives related to generating a large number of items with controlled psychometric properties including the latest development of using machine learning methods. The book illustrates automated scoring for different types of assessments such as speaking and writing from both methodological aspects and practical considerations. Further, it elaborates automated test assembly for the conventional linear tests from both classical test theory and item response theory perspectives. Item pool design and assembly for the linear-on-the-fly tests elaborates more complications in practice when test security is a big concern. Finally, several chapters focus on CAT at either item or module levels. CAT is further illustrated as an effective approach to increasing test-takers' engagement in testing. In summary, the book includes both theoretical, methodological, and applied research and practices that serve as the foundation for future development. These chapters provide illustrations of efforts to automate the process of test development. While some of these automation processes have become common practices such as automated test assembly, automated scoring, and computerized adaptive testing, some others such as automated item generation calls for more research and exploration. When new AI methods are emerging and evolving, it is expected that researchers can expand and improve the methods for automating different steps in test development to enhance the automation features and practitioners can adopt quality automation procedures to improve assessment practices.

AB  - Adaptive tests are more efficient than fixedlength tests through the use of item response theory; adaptive tests also present students questions that are tailored to their proficiency level. Although the adaptive algorithm is straightforward, developing a multidimensional computer adaptive test (MCAT) measure is complex. Evidencecentered design (ECD) can provide a highly structured framework to guide the development of a MCAT. In this paper, the development of the adaptive reading motivation measure (ARMM) demonstrates the process of applying ECD to the development of a MCAT measure. This paper focuses on the conceptual assessment framework layer of the ECD that guides the technical aspects of MCAT development. The five models of conceptual assessment framework layer are student model, task model, evidence model, assembly model, and presentation model. How each model guided the development of the ARMM is described in detail. In this paper, we demonstrate how the conceptual assessment framework in ECD can provide a useful structure for developing MCAT measures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently experience anxiety related to the caregiver role. Often this is due to a caregiver<e2><80><99>s perceived need to avoid people and situations that might upset or 'trigger' the care recipient. There are currently no self-report measures that capture these feelings; thus, this article describes the development and preliminary validation efforts for the TBI-Caregiver Quality of Life (CareQOL) Caregiver Vigilance item bank. Design: A sample of 532 caregivers of civilians (n = 218) or service members/veterans (SMVs; n = 314) with TBI completed 32 caregiver vigilance items, other measures of health-related quality of life (RAND-12, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression, PROMIS Social Isolation, Caregiver Appraisal Scale), and the Mayo<e2><80><93>Portland Adaptability Inventory-4. Results: The final item bank contains 18 items, as supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory graded response modeling (GRM), and differential item functioning investigations. Expert review and GRM calibration data informed the selection of a 6-item short form and programming of a computer adaptive test. Internal consistency reliability for the different administration formats were excellent (reliability coefficients <e2><89><a5> .90). Three-week test<e2><80><93>retest stability was supported (i.e., r <e2><89><a5> .78). Correlations between vigilance and other self-report measures supported convergent and discriminant validity (0.01 <e2><89><a4> r <e2><89><a4> .69). Known-groups validity was also supported. Conclusions: The new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Vigilance computer adaptive test and corresponding 6-item short form were developed using established rigorous measurement development standards, providing the first self-report measure to evaluate caregiver vigilance. This development work indicates that this measure exhibits strong psychometric properties. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

The figures in this article were reproduced from copies instead of from the originals, and although all figures were affected to some degree, Figure 1 as printed may be misleading. A reprint of Figure 1 from the original is presented. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in PA, Vol 80:12194.) Determined the auditory filtering capabilities of 4 normal listeners between 125 Hz and 1 kHz, with particular emphasis on changes of bandwidth level. Masked thresholds were determined for 4 probe frequencies at 4 levels of masking noise, each combination of probe frequency and masker level being tested at 5 notch widths. Thresholds were determined using a 2-down, 1-up adaptive testing procedure and a 2-interval, 2-alternative forced-choice task. Auditory filter bandwidths always decreased with decreasing frequency and generally increased with increasing level, although the size of the effect was not uniform across frequency. In general, the effect of level increased with frequency, with little or no effect on bandwidths at 125 Hz.<e2><80><a6> (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease with functional decline leading to disability. Dyspnea, the prominent symptom, can be measured using existing measures, but a lack of consensus about standardization of dyspnea measurement remains. We examined the psychometric performance of two item-response theory<e2><80><93> based (IRT) measures of dyspnea and related functional limitations (FLs) in patients with COPD and simulated computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of the banks to determine the number of questions required to achieve high precision. Methods: A total of 102 patients completed banks measuring dyspnea and FLs (33 items), from which the 10-item dyspnea and FL short forms were scored as well as other self-report measures of respiratory and physical function and emotional distress. A subset of patients completed the banks 7 to 10 days later. Pulmonary function test results were obtained from medical charts. Results: The 33-item banks and 10-item short forms had excellent internal consistency (alphas > 0.9) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.89). Patients sorted by severity level on the Medical Research Council scale were differentiated by item banks (P < 0.001) and the short forms (P < 0.01). The banks and short forms were also associated with related measures of dyspnea (e.g., Baseline Dyspnea Index, r = 0.47<e2><80><93>0.53), physical function (e.g., 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, r = <e2><88><92>0.83 to <e2><88><92>0.86) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = <e2><88><92>0.32 to <e2><88><92>0.35). On average, CAT required 4 and 5 items for accurate measurement of dyspnea and FLs, respectively. Conclusion: The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy<e2><80><93>Dyspnea short forms and banks provide options for brief, psychometrically sound measures of dyspnea and/or FLs in COPD.

AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-10 (CESD-10), and the 8-item PROMIS Depression Short Form (PROMIS-D-8; 8b short form) in a sample of individuals living with multiple sclerosis (MS). Research Method: Data were collected by a self-reported mailed survey of a community sample of people living with MS (n = 455). Factor structure, interitem reliability, convergent/discriminant validity and assignment to categories of depression severity were examined. Results: A 1-factor, confirmatory factor analytic model had adequate fit for all instruments. Scores on the depression scales were more highly correlated with one another than with scores on measures of pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. The CESD-10 categorized about 37% of participants as having significant depressive symptoms. At least moderate depression was indicated for 24% of participants by PHQ-9. PROMIS-D-8 identified 19% of participants as having at least moderate depressive symptoms and about 7% having at least moderately severe depression. None of the examined scales had ceiling effects, but the PROMIS-D-8 had a floor effect. Conclusions: Overall, scores on all 3 scales demonstrated essential unidimensionality and had acceptable interitem reliability and convergent/discriminant validity. Researchers and clinicians can choose any of these scales to measure depressive symptoms in individuals living with MS. The PHQ-9 offers validated cutoff scores for diagnosing clinical depression. The PROMIS-D-8 measure minimizes the impact of somatic features on the assessment of depression and allows for flexible administration, including Computerize Adaptive Testing (CAT). The CESD-10 measures 2 aspects of depression, depressed mood and lack of positive affect, while still providing an interpretable total score.

AB  - In this review we explore recent developments in computerized adaptive diagnostic screening and computerized adaptive testing for the presence and severity of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and mania. The statistical methodology is unique in that it is based on multidimensional item response theory (severity) and random forests (diagnosis) instead of traditional mental health measurement based on classical test theory (a simple total score) or unidimensional item response theory. We show that the information contained in large item banks consisting of hundreds of symptom items can be efficiently calibrated using multidimensional item response theory, and the information contained in these large item banks can be precisely extracted using adaptive administration of a small set of items for each individual. In terms of diagnosis, computerized adaptive diagnostic screening can accurately track an hour-long face-to-face clinician diagnostic interview for major depressive disorder (as an example) in less than a minute using an average of four questions with unprecedented high sensitivity and specificity. Directions for future research and applications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: At least half of youths with mental disorders are unrecognized and untreated. Rapid, accurate assessment of child mental disorders could facilitate identification and referral and potentially reduce the occurrence of functional disability that stems from early-onset mental disorders. Method: Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) based on multidimensional item response theory were developed for depression, anxiety, mania/hypomania, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and suicidality, based on parent and child ratings of 1,060 items each. In phase 1, CATs were developed from 801 participants. In phase 2, predictive, discriminant, and convergent validity were tested against semi-structured research interviews for diagnoses and suicidality in 497 patients and 104 healthy controls. Overall strength of association was determined by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The child and parent independently completed the Kiddie<e2><88><92>Computerized Adaptive Tests (K-CATs) in a median time of 7.56 and 5.03 minutes, respectively, with an average of 7 items per domain. The K-CATs accurately captured the presence of diagnoses (AUCs from 0.83 for generalized anxiety disorder to 0.92 for major depressive disorder) and suicidal ideation (AUC = 0.996). Strong correlations with extant measures were found (r <e2><89><a5> 0.60). Test<e2><88><92>retest reliability averaged r = 0.80. Conclusion: These K-CATs provide a new approach to child psychopathology screening and measurement. Testing can be completed by child and parent in less than 8 minutes and yields results that are highly convergent with much more time-consuming structured clinical interviews and dimensional severity assessment and measurement. Testing of the implementation of the K-CAT is now indicated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Personality Inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD) was recently developed to assess the ICD-11 model of personality disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the construct validity of the PiCD using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) and the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorders Static Form (CAT-PD-SF). We administered these tests to 328 college students (150 males, 178 females). We found that the PiCD had adequate internal consistency reliability. Correlations between scores from the PiCD scales and the criterion measures generally indicated adequate discriminant validity. Along the same lines, convergent validity was adequate for the PiCD Negative Affective, Disinhibition, and Dissocial scales. However, the evidence was more mixed for the PiCD Detachment and Anankastic domains, which may be due to limitations with the content domains for these scales. Consistent with other research and theoretical expectations, a conjoint exploratory factor analysis utilizing the PiCD and MMPI-2-RF PSY-5 scales also indicated that anankastic and disinhibition may be more appropriately conceptualized as measuring opposite poles of one construct. Implications of these findings for the PiCD and the ICD-11 model are discussed.

AB  - Underserved women of color experience high rates of perinatal affective disorders, but most research to date on the natural history of these disorders has been conducted on White women. The present study investigated longitudinal changes in anxiety and depression in a sample of perinatal non-Hispanic Black and Latina women. Categorical (yes/no) measures of positive anxiety and depression screens, as well as total symptom scores, were measured longitudinally across the perinatal period in 178 women (115 non-Hispanic Black, 63 Latina) using the CAT-MH, a computerized adaptive test. Time (up to 4 visits) and race/ethnicity effects were assessed in linear mixed effects models. Rates of positive anxiety screenings were 13.6%, 3.2%, 8.5%, and 0% in Latina women and 2.6%, 4.2%, 6.1%, and 5.8% in non-Hispanic Black women in the 1(st), 2(nd), and 3(rd) trimesters, and postpartum, respectively. Rates of positive anxiety screenings overall were highest in the first trimester (OR = 0.20; 95% CI 0.04-0.98), and there was a significant time-by-race/ethnicity interaction for positive anxiety screens (OR = 8.88; 95% CI 1.42-55.51), as positive screens were most frequent in the first trimester and sharply declined for Latina women, while rates were relatively consistent across the perinatal period in non-Hispanic Black women. Rates of positive depression screens did not change over time, but there was a trend (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 0.93-4.03) for a time-by-race/ethnicity interaction in a direction similar to that seen for anxiety. The odds of positive anxiety screens vary by race/ethnicity and trimester, suggesting that anxiety screening and anxiety interventions may be most resourcefully used in the first trimester for Latina women in particular.

AB  - There is a lack of standardized and comprehensive outcome measures for pain trials that have adequate comparative information for relevant samples, that can be used across a variety of research applications, and that allow investigators to combine or compare groups with different demographic or disease characteristics. Measures based on classical test theory (CTT) have a number of limitations, including respondent burden, inability to compare measures putatively assessing the same construct, and assumptions about linearity that may be unwarranted. Item response theory (IRT) methods offer potential advantages, and there is a growing awareness of the potential of IRT to complement and even replace some traditional psychometric approaches. Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) will likely be used increasingly as the technology improves and familiarity with this approach grows. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommended that six core outcome domains should be considered when designing chronic pain clinical trials: (1) pain; (2) physical functioning; (3) emotional functioning; (4) participant ratings of improvement and satisfaction with treatment; (5) symptoms and adverse events; and (6) participant disposition.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a publicly available, psychometrically sound item bank and short forms for measuring resilience in any population, but especially resilience in individuals with chronic medical conditions or long-term disability. Research Methods: A panel of 9 experts including disability researchers, clinical psychologists, and health outcomes researchers developed a definition of resilience that guided item development. The rigorous methodology used focus groups, cognitive interviews, and modern psychometric theory quantitative methods, including item response theory (IRT). Items were administered to a sample of people with chronic medical conditions commonly associated with disability (N = 1,457) and to a general population sample (N = 300) representative of the Unites States general population with respect to age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Results: The final item bank includes 28 items calibrated to IRT with the scores on a T-metric. A mean of 50 represents the mean resilience in the general population sample. Four and eight item short forms are available, and their scores are highly correlated with the item bank score (r <e2><89><a5> .94). Reliability is excellent across most of the resilience continuum. Initial analyses provide strong support for validity of the score. Conclusions: The findings support reliability and validity of the University of Washington Resilience Scale (UWRS) for assessing resilience in any population, including individuals with chronic health conditions or disabilities. It can be administered using computerized adaptive testing or by short forms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact and Implications<e2><80><94>This study describes the development and psychometric properties of the first resilience measure using stakeholder engagement to define the construct as well as modern psychometric methods, including item response theory (IRT). The UWRS has significant potential to advance both practice and research through its range of uses. It offers flexibility to use computerized adaptive testing or short forms, reducing respondent burden. It is suitable for assessing resilience in the general population as well as people with chronic health conditions or disability. The UWRS is also freely available, which facilitates its use in both research and clinical practice. Use of this psychometrically sound, person-centered, brief, flexible, and free resilience instrument will facilitate observational and intervention research, as well as research comparing resilience across populations and studies.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the association between characteristics of persons with traumatic brain injury (PwTBI) and perceived sleep-related impairment of the caregivers. Method: Fifty-two dyads (n = 23 civilians, n = 29 service members/veterans [SMVs]) were enrolled. Caregivers completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep-Related Impairment computer adaptive test, and PwTBI completed Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders measures of depression, anxiety, anger, cognitive functioning, and upper and lower extremity functioning. Hierarchical linear regression models, stratified by civilian/SMV group, were employed to assess prediction of caregiver-perceived sleep-related impairment from emotional distress of the PwTBI (anxiety, depressed mood, and anger) and perceived functional status of the PwTBI (cognitive, upper extremity, lower extremity functioning). Results: Compared with caregivers of civilians, caregivers of SMVs reported higher perceived sleep-related impairment. Regression results showed that characteristics of the PwTBI accounted for moderate amounts of variance in the sleep-related impairment of caregivers of both civilians and SMVs. Within-group analyses showed that the strongest predictor of sleep-related impairment of caregivers of civilians was self-reported cognitive function of the PwTBI (<ce><b2> = <e2><88><92>0.82, p = .08); the strongest predictor of sleep-related impairment of caregivers of SMVs was self-reported anger of the PwTBI (<ce><b2> = 0.54, p = .07). Conclusions: In both caregivers of civilians and SMVs with TBI, characteristics of the PwTBI were related to perceived caregiver sleep-related impairment. These preliminary data can inform future research with larger samples that examine the impact of multiple characteristics of the caregiver and care recipient on caregiver sleep. Findings highlight the potential importance of considering the dynamics of the dyad in rehabilitation programming not only for the PwTBI but for caregivers as well. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact and Implications: Characteristics of care recipients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have a substantial impact on caregiver sleep. Successful interventions to improve sleep in caregivers may need to address factors that are specific to the caregiver (e.g., emotional distress, health behaviors) as well as specific to the care recipient with TBI (e.g., functional limitations, emotional distress).

AB  - 45 undergraduates who scored 18 or above on the Test Anxiety Scale took part in a program designed to reduce test-taking anxiety. Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 conditions: standard covert reinforcement; covert rehearsal, which was similar to covert reinforcement except that the reinforcing scene was eliminated; information control, which involved discussion of adaptive test-taking strategies; attention placebo, which included discussion of early childhood evaluative experiences; and delayed treatment, in which Ss were offered treatment following posttreatment assessment. Prior to the inception of treatment, all Ss were given the Wonderlic Personnel Test and the State Anxiety Questionnaire; this procedure was repeated following treatment termination. Ss who received covert rehearsal reported less anxiety than Ss in other conditions. Results are inconclusive on the remaining dependent measures. An alternative conception to the operant model of the effective components of covert reinforcement is presented. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Psychological constructs are usually assessed by instruments based on classical test theory (CTT). Since the sixties, item response theory (IRT) offers a promising alternative to these traditional ways of test construction. On the basis of IRT computerized adaptive tests (CATs) can be developed that select items from an item bank according to previous responses of the patients. These individually tailored tests promise to maximize the measurement precision and require fewer items than conventional questionnaires. We constructed a CAT for anxiety to examine whether the theoretical advantages materialize in a practical application. Data of N=2,348 patients were collected at the Department of Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, Charit<c3><a9> University Medicine Berlin. As part of the diagnostic routines a broad set of established questionnaires was answered. Out of these questionnaires, 81 items with relevance to anxiety were selected in a Delphi process. The properties of these items were examined by confirmatory factor analysis with analysis of residual correlations (MplusTM, evaluation of item response curves (TestgrafTM), and computation of discrimination parameters (ParscaleTM). Fifty items remained in the item pool after the selection process. Item parameters were estimated according to the Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM). Simulation studies show that anxiety can be estimated with approx. 7 items (standard error of <e2><89><a4>.32, corresponding to a reliability level of p <e2><89><a5>.90). Furthermore, our simulation studies indicate that the CAT algorithm has higher discriminative power for patients at high and low levels of anxiety compared to a conventional CCT based sum score (STAI state scale).

AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory<e2><80><93>2 Restructured Form (MMPI<e2><80><93>2<e2><80><93>RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder<e2><80><93>Static Form (CAT<e2><80><93>PD<e2><80><93>SF; Simms et al., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI<e2><80><93>2<e2><80><93>RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT<e2><80><93>PD<e2><80><93>SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial (<e2><89><a5> |.30|) correlations. The MMPI<e2><80><93>2<e2><80><93>RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT<e2><80><93>PD<e2><80><93>SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article discusses 3 modern forced-choice personality tests developed for the U.S Armed Services to provide resistance to faking and other forms of response distortion: the Assessment of Individual Motivation, the Navy Computerized Adaptive Personality Scales, and the Tailored Adaptive Personality Assessment System. These tests represent the transition from Likert to forced-choice formats and from static to computerized adaptive item selection to meet the challenges of large-scale, high-stakes testing environments. For each test, we briefly describe the personality constructs that are assessed, the response format and scoring methods, and selected ongoing research and development efforts. We also highlight the potential of these tests for personnel selection, classification, and diagnostic screening purposes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We investigated the effects of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) versus computerized fixed item testing (FIT) of reasoning ability on current motivation in terms of situational fear of failure and subjective probability of success, as well as flow. A group of 174 students (aged 15<e2><80><93>21) from two German secondary schools was presented either a CAT or a FIT version of a matrices test; motivational variables were assessed during a short break in testing. More situational fear of failure and less subjective probability of success were reported using CAT compared to FIT. Self-reported flow did not differ between test mode conditions. When we addressed the hypothesis that adaptive testing is equally motivating for both high and lower performers, test performance appeared to moderate the relationship of test mode and subjective probability of success: Only during FIT was subjective probability of success higher with lower test performance. This moderation effect was also revealed for the relationship of test mode and flow. However, as average reported motivation was lower during CAT, results contradict assumptions of enhanced motivation during CAT. Results are discussed in relation to self-concept relevance of testing domains and with reference to test fairness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Item selection strategy (ISS) is an important component of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). Its performance directly affects the security, efficiency and precision of the test. Thus, ISS becomes one of the central issues in CATs based on the Graded Response Model (GRM). It is well known that the goal of IIS is to administer the next unused item remaining in the item bank that best fits the examinees current ability estimate. In dichotomous IRT models, every item has only one difficulty parameter and the item whose difficulty matches the examinee's current ability estimate is considered to be the best fitting item. However, in GRM, each item has more than two ordered categories and has no single value to represent the item difficulty. Consequently, some researchers have used to employ the average or the median difficulty value across categories as the difficulty estimate for the item. Using the average value and the median value in effect introduced two corresponding ISSs. In this study, we used computer simulation compare four ISSs based on GRM. We also discussed the effect of 'shadow pool' on the uniformity of pool usage as well as the influence of different item parameter distributions and different ability estimation methods on the evaluation criteria of CAT. In the simulation process, Monte Carlo method was adopted to simulate the entire CAT process; 1,000 examinees drawn from standard normal distribution and four 1,000-sized item pools of different item parameter distributions were also simulated. The assumption of the simulation is that a polytomous item is comprised of six ordered categories. In addition, ability estimates were derived using two methods. They were expected a posteriori Bayesian (EAP) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In MLE, the Newton-Raphson iteration method and the Fisher Score iteration method were employed, respectively, to solve the likelihood equation. Moreover, the CAT process was simulated with each examinee 30 times to eliminate random error. The IISs were evaluated by four indices usually used in CAT from four aspects--the accuracy of ability estimation, the stability of IIS, the usage of item pool, and the test efficiency. Simulation results showed adequate evaluation of the ISS that matched the estimate of an examinee's current trait level with the difficulty values across categories. Setting 'shadow pool' in ISS was able to improve the uniformity of pool utilization. Finally, different distributions of the item parameter and different ability estimation methods affected the evaluation indices of CAT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Measurement informed care is a cornerstone of evidence-based practice and shared decision-making. A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient<e2><80><99>s perspective of the presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of executive function, emotional regulation, mindwandering, and sluggish cognitive tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients. Psychometrically validated tools are available to complement every aspect of ADHD care and provide global standards for research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In 1997, we published a review in PharmacoEconomics about quality of life (QOL) measurement in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this article is to provide an update, as well as to revisit the development of the construct of QOL and its measurement as applied to schizophrenia. Since our previous article, there has been significant growth in the number of publications about QOL in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, alongside this significant increase in research interest, a number of concerns have also risen about the limitations and lack of impact the concept of QOL has on clinical care and health-policy decision making. A number of concerns previously outlined (such as lack of consensus on a uniform definition of QOL) continue to be an issue. However, we believe that a uniform definition may not be possible, and instead, it may be preferable to have several definitions, which may enrich the concept and broaden its usefulness. Some of the scales we reviewed in 1997 continue to be in use, while others are now rarely or never used. New scales with better psychometrics have been introduced, but most are without theoretical or conceptual foundation. On the other hand, the field of scaling in general has been changing over the past few years and is moving towards a new approach for scale development, based on item response theory, item banks and computer adaptive testing. Unfortunately, this has not extended to QOL in schizophrenia. There continues to be a dearth of theoretical and conceptual models for QOL in schizophrenia, which seems to create the perception that the construct lacks a good theoretical and scientific foundation. One of the major gaps identified in this review is the recognized lack of impact of QOL measurements on clinical management or policy decision making. The majority of publications continue to focus on measurement rather than what to do with the data. The lack of strategies to integrate QOL data in clinical care, as well as the failure to contribute to policy decisions, particularly in cost analysis or resource allocations, has created the perception that the construct of QOL in schizophrenia is not that useful. It is evident that, for QOL in schizophrenia to regain its promise, researchers must take the ultimate next step beyond measurement: to develop credible strategies for integrating QOL data in clinical practice. Additionally, more focused research is needed to demonstrate the role of QOL, not only as an outcome in itself but also as a contributor to other outcomes, such as adherence to medications, more satisfaction, less resource utilization and so on. Since self-appraisal of QOL does not happen in a vacuum but relates to the total human experience in all its biological, psychosocial and environmental aspects, particular attention must also be focused on important neurobiological dimensions such as affect and cognition. Both are significantly affected by the illness itself and its treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Depression and anxiety disorders are common conditions with significant morbidity. Many screening tools of varying length have been well validated for these conditions in the office-based setting. Novel instruments, including Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, may be promising tools in the future. The best evidence for cost-effectiveness currently is for screening of major depression linked with the collaborative care model for treatment. Data are not conclusive regarding comparative cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple conditions at once or for other conditions. This article reviews screening tools for depression and anxiety disorders in the ambulatory setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To develop psychometrically sound, culturally relevant, and linguistically equivalent English and Spanish self-report measures of social health guided by a comprehensive conceptual model and applicable across chronic illnesses. Methods: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Social Health Workgroup implemented a mixed methods approach to evaluate earlier results (v1.0); expand and refine domain definitions and items; translate items into Spanish; and obtain qualitative feedback. Computer-based and paper/pencil questionnaire administration was conducted with a variety of U.S. respondent samples during 2009<e2><80><93>2012. Analyses included exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), two-parameter logistic item response theory (IRT) modeling, evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF), and evaluation of criterion and construct validity. Results: Qualitative feedback supported the conceptualization of the Social Health domain framework (Social Function and Social Relationships subcomponents). Validation testing participants (n = 2,208 English; n = 644 Spanish) were diverse in terms of gender, age, education, and ethnicity/race. EFA, CFA, and IRT identified 7 unidimensional factors with good model fit. There was no DIF by language, and good evidence of criterion and construct validity. Conclusions: PROMIS English and Spanish language instruments (v2.0), including computer-adaptive tests and fixed-length short forms, are publicly available for assessment of Social Function (Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, and Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities) and Social Relationships (Companionship; Emotional, Informational and Instrumental Support; and Social Isolation). Measures of social health will play a key role in applications that use ecologic (or determinants of health) models that emphasize how patients<e2><80><99> social environments influence their health.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the results from a simulated computerized adaptive test (CAT) for the 28-item Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire and the original paper-pencil version in terms of efficiency (main outcome), defined as percentage item reduction. METHODS: Using paper-pencil IVI data from 832 participants across the spectrum of vision impairment, item calibrations of the 28-item IVI instrument and its associated 20-item vision-specific functioning (VSF) and 8-item emotional well-being (EWB) subscales were generated with Rasch analysis. Based on these calibrations, CAT simulations were conducted on 1000 cases, with 'high' and 'moderate' precision stopping rules (standard error of measurement [SEM] 0.387 and 0.521, respectively). We examined the average number of items needed to satisfy the stopping rules and the corresponding percentage item reduction, level of agreement between person measures estimated from the full IVI item bank and from the CAT simulations, and item exposure rates (IER). RESULTS: For the overall IVI-CAT, 5 or 9.7 items were required, on average, to obtain moderate or high precision estimates of vision-related quality of life, corresponding to 82.1 and 65.4% item reductions compared to the paper-pencil IVI. Agreement was high between the person measures generated from the full IVI item bank and the IVI-CAT for both the high precision simulation (mean bias, - 0.004 logits; 95% LOA - 0.594 to 0.587) and moderate precision simulation (mean bias, 0.014 logits; 95% LOA - 0.828 to 0.855). The IER for the IVI-CAT in the moderate precision simulation was skewed, with six EWB items used > 40% of the time. CONCLUSION: Compared to the paper-pencil IVI instrument, the IVI-CATs required fewer items without loss of measurement precision, making them potentially attractive outcome instruments for implementation into clinical trials, healthcare, and research. Final versions of the IVI-CATs are available.

AB  - Background: The construction and evaluation of item banks to measure unidimensional constructs of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a fundamental objective of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) project. Objectives: Item banks will be used as the foundation for developing short-form instruments and enabling computerized adaptive testing. The PROMIS Steering Committee selected 5 HRQOL domains for initial focus: physical functioning, fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and social role participation. This report provides an overview of the methods used in the PROMIS item analyses and proposed calibration of item banks. Analyses: Analyses include evaluation of data quality (eg, logic and range checking, spread of response distribution within an item), descriptive statistics (eg, frequencies, means), item response theory model assumptions (unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity), model fit, differential item functioning, and item calibration for banking. Recommendations: Summarized are key analytic issues; recommendations are provided for future evaluations of item banks in HRQOL assessment.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to validate the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric item banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a, and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in a general Dutch population and to provide reference data. Methods: Participants (N = 2,893, aged 8<e2><80><93>18), recruited by two internet survey providers, completed both item banks. These item banks were assessed on unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity, Graded Response Model (GRM) item fit, and differential item functioning (DIF) for gender, age group, region, ethnicity, and language. The short forms and CATs were assessed on reliability and construct validity compared to the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale short version (RCADS-22) subscales. Reference scores were calculated. Results: Both item banks showed sufficient unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity, and GRM item fit, except for three Depressive Symptoms items that showed insufficient GRM item fit. No DIF was found when using ordinal regression analyses, except for two Depressive Symptoms items that showed DIF for language; all items showed DIF for language when using IRT PRO, except for one Anxiety item. Both short forms and CATs revealed sufficient reliability for moderate and severe levels of anxiety and depression, as well as high positive correlations with corresponding RCADS-22 subscales and slightly lower correlations with non-corresponding RCADS-22 subscales. Conclusion: The Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric item banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a and CATs are useful to assess and monitor anxiety and depression in a general population. Reference data are presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: A comprehensive, reliable, and valid measurement system is needed to monitor changes in children with neurological conditions who experience lifelong functional limitations. Objective. This article describes the development and psychometric properties of the pediatric version of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) measurement system. Methods: The pediatric Neuro-QOL consists of generic and targeted measures. Literature review, focus groups, individual interviews, cognitive interviews of children and consensus meetings were used to identify and finalize relevant domains and item content. Testing was conducted on 1018 children aged 10 to 17 years drawn from the US general population for generic measures and 171 similarly aged children with muscular dystrophy or epilepsy for targeted measures. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor analytic methods. For unidimensional domains, item parameters were estimated using item response theory models. Measures with acceptable fit indices were calibrated as item banks; those without acceptable fit indices were treated as summary scales. Results: Ten measures were developed: 8 generic or targeted banks (anxiety, depression, anger, interaction with peers, fatigue, pain, applied cognition, and stigma) and 2 generic scales (upper and lower extremity function). The banks reliably (r > 0.90) measured 63.2% to 100% of the children tested. Conclusions: The pediatric Neuro-QOL is a comprehensive measurement system with acceptable psychometric properties that could be used in computerized adaptive testing. The next step is to validate these measures in various clinical populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) is a patient-reported outcome measurement system that is specific to caregivers of civilians and service members/veterans (SMVs) with traumatic brain injury (TBI). This measurement system includes 26 item banks that represent both generic (i.e., borrowed from existing measurement systems) and caregiver-specific components of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This report provides reliability and validity data for measures within the TBI-CareQOL that have not previously been reported (i.e., 4 caregiver-specific and 7 generic measures of HRQOL). Design: Three hundred eighty-five caregivers of persons with TBI completed caregiver-specific computer adaptive tests (CATs) for Feelings of Loss-Self, Caregiver Strain, Caregiver-Specific Anxiety, and Feeling Trapped, as well as generic measures of HRQOL from complementary measurement systems (i.e., Neuro-QoL Positive Affect and Well-Being; PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment; NIH Toolbox Perceived Stress, General Life Satisfaction, and Self Efficacy; TBI-QOL Resilience and Grief/Loss). Caregivers also completed several additional measures to establish convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the Mayo Portland Adaptability Index, 4th ed. Results: Findings support the internal consistency reliability (all alphas > .85) and test-retest stability (all alphas >.73) of the TBI-CareQOL measures. Convergent validity was supported by moderate to high correlations between the TBI-CareQOL measures and related measures, whereas discriminant validity was supported by low correlations between the TBI-CareQOL measures and unrelated constructs. Known-groups validity was also supported. Conclusions: Findings support the reliability and validity of the item banks that comprise the TBI-CareQOL Measurement System. These measures should be considered for any standardized assessment of HRQOL in caregivers of civilians and SMVs with TBI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared results obtained from computer-adaptive (CAT) and self-adaptive tests (SAT) under conditions in which item review was permitted and not permitted. 379 college students completed a test anxiety inventory, one form of a computerized vocabulary test (CAT or SAT), and questionnaires assessing demographic information and attitudes about computerized tests. Comparisons of answers before and after review within the 'review' condition showed that a small percentage of answers was changed, that more answers were changed from wrong to right than from right to wrong, that most Ss changed answers to at least some questions, and that most Ss who changed answers improved their ability estimates by doing so.

AB  - In self-adapted testing (SAT), examinees choose the difficulty of each item they attempt immediately before it is presented. In this article, the author reviews the rationale for investigating SAT and research exploring the effects of SAT on ability estimates, precision and efficiency, mechanisms underlying the effects associated with SAT, and examinee reactions to SAT. Some of the research demonstrates that SAT leads to higher ability estimates than computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whereas other research demonstrated no main effect of test administration mode but that SAT leads to ability estimates that are less influenced by extraneous attributes of the examinee (e.g., test anxiety). SAT is less efficient than CAT, but more efficient than fixed-item testing. Examinees strongly endorse the main elements of SAT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While estimation bias is a primary concern in psychological and educational measurement, the standard error is of equal importance in linking key aspects of the assessment structure, especially when the assessment goal concerns the classification of individuals into categories (e.g., master/non-mastery). In this paper, we show analytically how standard error of ability estimates affects expected classification accuracy and consistency when the decision is binary. When standard error decreases, the conditional classification accuracy and consistency increase. Given an examinee population and a cut score, smaller standard error over the entire latent trait continuum guarantees higher overall expected classification accuracy and consistency. We were also able to show the interrelationship between standard error, the expected classification consistency, and reliability. Utilizing the relationship between standard error and expected classification accuracy and consistency, we derive the upper bounds of the overall expected classification accuracy and consistency of a fixed-length computerized adaptive test. The lower bound of the expected classification accuracy and consistency is also derived given a number of stopping rules of variable-length computerized adaptive testing. Implications of these analytical results on operational tests are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) provides improved precision and decreased test burden compared with traditional, fixed-length tests. Concerns have been raised regarding reliability of CAT-based measurements because the items administered vary both between and within individuals over time. The study measured test-retest reliability of the CAT Depression Inventory (CAT-DI) for assessment of depression in a screening setting where most scores fall in the normal range. Methods: A random sample of adults (N = 101) at an academic emergency department (ED) was screened twice with the CAT-DI during their visit. Test-retest scores, bias, and reliability were assessed. Results: Fourteen percent of patients scored in the mild range for depression, 4% in the moderate range, and 3% in the severe range. Test-retest scores were without significant bias and had excellent reliability (r = .92). Conclusions: The CAT-DI provided reliable screening results among ED patients. Concerns about whether changes in item presentation during repeat testing would affect test-retest reliability were not supported. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors describe the first application of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to personnel assessment in the Department of Defense: The U.S. Army's Computerized Adaptive Screening Test, known as CAST. CAST was introduced in 1984 as a more efficient alternative to a paper-and-pencil test, the Enlistment Screening Test. The purpose of both tests was to give military recruiters a means to forecast a candidate's aptitude qualification for military service by predicting his or her score on the Armed Forces Qualification Test composite of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. Knowing who is likely to qualify for enlistment results in more efficient use of recruiters' time and other resources. The chapter summarizes the motivation for developing CAST, as well as its design, development, functional features and validation. Finally, the authors cite CAST as an example of cooperation among the Services, and provide a glimpse of related future developments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Explored the effect of reviewing items and altering responses on examinee ability estimates, test precision, test information, decision confidence, and pass/fail status for computerized adaptive tests. Two different populations of examinees took different computerized certification examinations. For purposes of analysis, each population was divided into 3 ability groups (high, medium, and low). Ability measures before and after review were highly correlated, but slightly lower decision confidence was found after review. Pass/fail status was most affected for examinees with estimates close to the pass point. Decisions remained the same for 94% of the examinees. Test precision is only slightly affected by review, and the average information loss can be recovered by the addition of one item. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many organizations provide linear test forms of multiple-choice items or other traditional formats and score them with classical methods. While the advent of the computer has most definitely affected how tests are delivered, in many cases, it is still a traditional test with classical scoring, just shown on a computer screen rather than paper. With the advent of The Cloud, innovation is becoming stronger and faster, offering us more avenues to improving student assessment<e2><80><94>and, therefore, student learning. The core of much innovation is the concept of automation; leveraging advances in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve how assessments are developed, delivered, and analyzed. The rapid increase in computing power and availability of other technological resources is fueling this change, impacting nearly every aspect of assessment from the writing of the first item to the reporting of the final student score. This chapter discusses a number of these aspects and some of the innovations currently under way, including automated item generation, automated test assembly, computerized adaptive testing, and psychometric forensics.

Reckase (Educational and Psychological Measurement, 2020[Oct], Vol 80[5], 955-974). In the original article, funding information was missed to be added in this article. Please note the following funding information - Funding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by Shandong Jianzhu University Doctoral Research Fund (Grant number: XNBS20126). (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-60277-006[/rid]). The present study extended the p-optimality method to the multistage computerized adaptive test (MST) context in developing optimal item pools to support different MST panel designs under different test configurations. Using the Rasch model, simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 simulated optimal item pools were generated and evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. Results showed that the optimal item pools built with the p-optimality method provide sufficient measurement accuracy under all simulated MST panel designs. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but not the item distributions and item pool characteristics. This study demonstrated that the p-optimality method can adapt to MST item pool design, facilitate the MST assembly process, and improve its scoring accuracy.

AB  - Background: An innovative measurement system using a computerized adaptive testing technique based on the item response theory (CAT) has been expanding to measure mental health status. However, little is known about details in its measurement properties based on the empirical data. Moreover, the response time (RT) data, which are not available by a paper-and-pencil measurement but available by a computerized measurement, would be worth investigating for exploring the response behavior. Purpose: We aimed at constructing the CAT to measure depressive symptomatology in a community population and exploring its measurement properties. Also, we examined the relationships between RTs, individual item responses, and depressive levels. Method: For constructing the CAT system, responses of 2061 workers and university students to 24 depression scale plus four negatively revised positive affect items were subjected to a polytomous IRT analysis. The stopping rule was set for standard error of estimation < 0.30 or the maximum 15 items displayed. The CAT and non-adaptive computer-based test (CBT) were administered to 209 undergraduates, and 168 of them administered again after 1 week. Results: On average, the CAT was converged by 10.4 items. The <ce><b8> values estimated by CAT and CBT were highly correlated (r = 0.94 and 0.95 for the 1st and 2nd measurements) and with the traditional scoring procedures (r<e2><80><99>s > 0.90). The test<e2><80><93>retest reliability was at a satisfactory level (r = 0.86). RTs to some items significantly correlated with the <ce><b8> estimates. The mean RT varied by the item contents and wording, i.e., the RT to positive affect items required additional 2 s or longer than the other subscale items. Conclusion: The CAT would be a reliable and practical measurement tool for various purposes including stress check at workplace. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing for cognitive diagnosis (CDCAT) needs to be efficient and responsive in real time to meet practical applications' requirements. For highdimensional data, the number of categories to be recognized in a test grows exponentially as the number of attributes increases, which can easily cause system reaction time to be too long such that it adversely affects the examinees and thus seriously impacts the measurement efficiency. More importantly, the longtime CPU operations and memory usage of item selection in CDCAT due to intensive computation are impractical and cannot wholly meet practice needs. This paper proposed two new efficient selection strategies (HIA and CEL) for highdimensional CDCAT to address this issue by incorporating the maxmarginals from the maximum a posteriori query and integrating the ensemble learning approach into the previous efficient selection methods, respectively. The performance of the proposed selection method was compared with the conventional selection method using simulated and real item pools. The results showed that the proposed methods could significantly improve the measurement efficiency with about 1/21/200 of the conventional methods' computation time while retaining similar measurement accuracy. With increasing number of attributes and size of the item pool, the computation time advantage of the proposed methods becomes more significant.

AB  - Emotion knowledge in children includes emotion recognition in other peoples<e2><80><99> faces, as well as understanding the internal and external causes and consequences of emotions and strategies for regulating them. To date, there is no measure in the German-speaking countries that captures emotion knowledge in a differentiated but also reliable and valid way. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM) aims to close this gap. The ATEM follows an adaptive design and six components of emotion knowledge. The 32 Rasch-scaled items are embedded in an attractive story and vary in their difficulty within and between the components. In a sample of 581 3<e2><80><93>9-year-olds, the test showed a good fit to a six-dimensional model and very good psychometric properties. In a subsample of 254 3<e2><80><93>5-year-olds, correlations between the ATEM and a measure of emotion knowledge and measures of expressive and receptive language abilities demonstrated good validity. The ATEM proved to be a good measure of emotion knowledge in children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Das Emotionswissen von Kindern umfasst neben dem Ablesen von Emotionen aus Gesichtern anderer Menschen auch das Erkennen von externalen und internalen Ursachen von Emotionen sowie das Wissen <c3><bc>ber ihre Konsequenzen und Regulationsm<c3><b6>glichkeiten. Im deutschsprachigen Raum gibt es bisher kein Testverfahren, welches das Emotionswissen auf diese Weise differenziert und gleichzeitig reliabel und valide erfasst. Mit dem Adaptiven Test des Emotionswissens (ATEM) wird diese L<c3><bc>cke geschlossen. Der ATEM fragt in einem adaptiven Design 6 Teilaspekte des Emotionswissens ab, wobei die 32 Items in eine kinderfreundliche Geschichte eingebettet sind. Der nach der Item-Response-Theorie aufgebaute Test zeigt mit einer Gesamtstichprobe von N = 581 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 9 Jahren gute psychometrische Eigenschaften. In einer Substichprobe von n = 254 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 5 Jahren wurde der ATEM anhand von Korrelationen mit verschiedenen Variablen validiert. Insgesamt eignet sich der ATEM gut zur differenzierten Messung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Es wird <c3><bc>ber die Entwicklung und <c3><9c>berpr<c3><bc>fung eines Computer-adaptierten Angst-Tests (A-CAT sub 1)berichtet. Die empirische Erfassung psychischer Merkmale erfolgt in der Regel mit Instrumenten, die auf der Grundlage der klassischen Testtheorie entwickelt wurden. Seit den sechziger Jahren bietet sich hierzu mit der Item Response Theory (IRT) eine Alternative an, die verschiedene Vorteile verspricht. Auf ihrer Grundlage k<c3><b6>nnen u. a. computeradaptive Tests (CATs) entwickelt werden, die die Auswahl der vorgelegten Items dem Antwortverhalten der Patienten anpassen und damit eine h<c3><b6>here Messgenauigkeit bei reduzierter Itemzahl erm<c3><b6>glichen sollen. Von den Autoren wurden verschiedene Schritte zur Entwicklung eines CAT zur Erfassung von Angst unternommen, um zu pr<c3><bc>fen, ob sich die theoretischen Vorz<c3><bc>ge der IRT auch in der praktischen Umsetzung best<c3><a4>tigen lassen. Dargestellt wird die Entwicklung der zu Grunde liegenden Itembank. Hierf<c3><bc>r wurde auf Daten von 2348 Patienten zur<c3><bc>ckgegriffen, die an der Medizinischen Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Psychosomatik der Charit<c3><a9> zwischen 1995 und 2001 im Rahmen der Routinediagnostik ein umfangreiches Set etablierter konventioneller Frageb<c3><b6>gen computergest<c3><bc>tzt beantwortet hatten. Diese beinhalteten 81 Items, die in einem Experten-Rating f<c3><bc>r das Merkmal Angst als relevant angesehen wurden. Die Eigenschaften dieser Items wurden anhand ihrer residualen Korrelationen nach konfirmatorischer Faktorenanalyse (Mplus), ihrer Antwortkategorienfunktion (Testgraf) und ihrer Diskriminationsf<c3><a4>higkeit (Parscale) <c3><bc>berpr<c3><bc>ft. Es verblieben 50 Items, die f<c3><bc>r die Anwendung eines polytomen Zwei-Parameter-Modells (Generalized Partial Credit Model) als geeignet angesehen werden k<c3><b6>nnen. Orientiert man sich an einer Reliabilit<c3><a4>t von p &gt;= .90 und legt f<c3><bc>r den computeradaptiven Testalgorithmus einen Standardfehler von p &lt;= .32 fest, so zeigen Simulationsstudien, dass die Merkmalsauspr<c3><a4>gung f<c3><bc>r Angst im Bereich von <c2><b1> 2 Standardabweichungen um den Mittelwert der Stichprobe mit etwa sieben Items ermittelt werden kann. Zudem legen die Simulationsstudien nahe, dass der CAT-Algorithmus das Merkmal in den oberen und unteren Auspr<c3><a4>gungen besser zu differenzieren vermag als die konventionell berechnete Summen-Skala des STAI (State-Trait-Angstinventar).

AB  - Das Emotionswissen umfasst verschiedene Bereiche des Erkennens und des Verst<c3><a4>ndnisses von den Emotionen und Emotionsausl<c3><b6>sern in anderen Menschen. Die Entwicklung des Emotionswissens findet zu einem gro<c3><9f>en Teil in der fr<c3><bc>hen und mittleren Kindheit statt und h<c3><a4>ngt mit verschiedenen weiteren emotionalen, sozialen und kognitiven Kompetenzen zusammen. In der aktuellen Forschung bestehen jedoch gro<c3><9f>e Unterschiede in der Operationalisierung des Konstruktes. Diese Dissertation hat das Ziel, einige Zusammenh<c3><a4>nge des Emotionswissens mit weiteren Variablen genauer zu untersuchen und ein neues Instrument zur Erfassung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern vorzustellen. Es wird der Zusammenhang des Emotionswissens von Kindern in der fr<c3><bc>hen und mittleren Kindheit mit schulischem Erfolg in Form von der Peerakzeptanz, der Einstellung zur Schule und der akademischen Leistungen betrachtet. Zudem werden die Entwicklung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern mit und ohne Migrationshintergrund, unter Einbezug ihres Sprachverst<c3><a4>ndnisses und ihrer behavioraler Selbstregulation, verglichen. Au<c3><9f>erdem werden die psychometrischen Eigenschaften des neu entwickelten Adaptiven Tests des Emotionswissens f<c3><bc>r drei- bis neunj<c3><a4>hrige Kinder untersucht. In dem ersten Beitrag der Dissertation, der drei Metaanalysen zum Zusammenhang zwischen dem Emotionswissen und schulischem Erfolg vorstellt, ergaben sich ein mittlerer Zusammenhang des Emotionswissens mit akademischem Schulerfolg und kleine Zusammenh<c3><a4>nge mit Peerakzeptanz und der Einstellung zur Schule. Es zeigte sich unter anderem der sozio<c3><b6>konomische Status als ein moderierender Faktor auf diese Zusammenh<c3><a4>nge. Im zweiten Beitrag der Dissertation, in dem ein Zuwachsmodell des Emotionswissens unter Einbezug von drei Messzeitpunkten innerhalb eines Jahres berechnet wurde, zeigten Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund zu allen Messzeitpunkten ein statistisch bedeutsam geringeres Emotionswissen als Kinder ohne Migrationshintergrund. Der Zusammenhang des Migrationshintergrundes mit dem Anfangswert des Emotionswissens wurde dabei vom Sprachverst<c3><a4>ndnis und der behavioralen Selbstregulation mediiert. Der Adaptive Test des Emotionswissens f<c3><bc>r drei-bis neunj<c3><a4>hrige Kinder wurde mit dem Ziel entwickelt, eine differenzierte und gleichzeitig zeit<c3><b6>konomische Erhebung des Emotionswisssens bei dieser Altersgruppe zu erm<c3><b6>glichen. Der dritte Beitrag der Dissertation stellt die psychometrischen Eigenschaften des Tests vor, der bei einer Stichprobe von 581 Kindern angewendet wurde. Die vorliegende Dissertation unterstreicht die Relevanz des Emotionswissens bez<c3><bc>glich des sozialen und akademischen Erfolges von Kindern und verdeutlicht die Herausforderungen, vor denen Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund stehen. Der Adaptive Test des Emotionswissens f<c3><bc>r drei- bis neunj<c3><a4>hrige Kinder stellte sich als ein reliables und valides Instrument heraus, welches die Forschung zum Emotionswissen von Kindern vergleichbarer machen k<c3><b6>nnte. - Contents: (1) Voltmer, K. &amp; von Salisch, M.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Computer Adaptive Testing v2.0 (UE), Pain Interference (P-Interference), and Pain Intensity (P-Intensity) in patients treated nonoperatively for idiopathic adhesive capsulitis (IAC). METHODS: The anchor-based MCID, SCB, and PASS were calculated as the change in PROMIS scores representing the optimal cutoff for a ROC curve with an area under the curve (AUC) analysis. The distribution-based MCID was calculated as a range between the average standard error of measurement multiplied by two different constants: 1 and 2.77. Effect sizes and standardized response means (SRM) were calculated to assess the responsiveness of each PROMIS instrument while regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with achieving these thresholds. RESULTS: This study enrolled 115 patients. The anchor-based MCID for PROMIS UE, P-Interference, and P-Intensity was 5.11, 4.16, and 8.16, respectively. The respective SCB was 8.44, 6.65, and 10.05. The respective PASS was 8.47, 7.01, and 10.41. The odds of achieving MCID values in adhesive capsulitis were negatively affected by gender (male), higher forward elevation at the time of presentation, higher pain scores (P-Interference), need for >/= 2 corticosteroid injections, and a concomitant diagnosis of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The MCID, SCB, and PASS parameters for PROMIS scores can be utilized to determine the clinical meaningfulness of patient-reported improvements in these instruments during the nonoperative treatment and as a research tool to compare the efficacy of new treatments for adhesive capsulitis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, basic science study, validation of outcome instruments. Key points * This is the first study to calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) for the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity and Pain instruments in patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis (IAC) of the shoulder.* This study determined the impact of symptom severity, demographics, and comorbidities on achieving the MCID, SCB, and PASS for PROMIS instruments in IAC patients treated nonoperatively.

They are a vital part of learning health systems as they are the primary source of information about important outcomes that are best assessed by patients such as pain, disability, anxiety and depression. The volume of questions can easily become burdensome. Previous techniques reduced this burden by dynamically selecting questions from question item banks which are specifically built for different latent constructs being measured. These techniques analyzed the information function between each question in the item bank and the measured construct based on item response theory then used this information function to dynamically select questions by computerized adaptive testing. Here we extend those ideas by using Bayesian Networks (BNs) to enable Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) for efficient and accurate question selection on widely-used existing PROMs. BNs offer more comprehensive probabilistic models of the connections between different PROM questions, allowing the use of information theoretic techniques to select the most informative questions. We tested our methods using five clinical PROM datasets, demonstrating that answering a small subset of questions selected with CAT has similar predictions and error to answering all questions in the PROM BN. Our results show that answering 30% - 75% questions selected with CAT had an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 (min: 0.8 - max: 0.98) for predicting the measured constructs. BNs outperformed alternative CAT approaches with a 5% (min: 0.01% - max: 9%) average increase in the accuracy of predicting the responses to unanswered question items.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional status of individuals with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) followed up at a reference center in the state of Bahia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study, which evaluated individuals with OI, based on a non-probabilistic sampling. To assess motor function, the Motor Function Measure (MFM) score was used, in addition to the measurement of muscle strength using the Medical Research Council (MRC) score. Functional performance was measured using the Pediatric Assessment of Disability Inventory, Computerized Adaptive Testing (PEDI-CAT). RESULTS: Thirty-one individuals aged between two and 18 years old were evaluated. The overall score of MFM was 74.2%, and the lowest score was found in participants with type III OI (56.3%). The median of the MRC index was 80. The mobility domain was the most affected in the PEDI-CAT evaluation, with a mean T score of 23.9, (14.2 in type III OI). CONCLUSIONS: Among the evaluated individuals, functional alterations were identified, reduced global gross motor functionality and muscle strength, impacting the mobility domain, with the most relevant findings in individuals with type III OI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to interpret a quantitative diagnosis model of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes based on computer adaptive testing (CAT), from the perspective of both patients and clinicians. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients with postprandial distress syndrome completed the CAT model of TCM syndromes and the Chinese version of the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Functional Digestive Disorders (Chin-FDDQL); the clinicians' diagnosis was concurrently recorded. The patients completed this questionnaire again after 14 +/- 2 days. The kappa test and paired chi-square test were used to evaluate the consistency between the CAT model and clinical diagnosis. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of the Chin-FDDQL scores were used to assess clinical efficacy from the patients' perspective. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores and changes in clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores may affect the clinical outcomes of patients with the total scores of Chin-FDDQL (all P < 0.05). There was a correlation between changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores and the patients' clinical outcomes. Different syndrome elements had different effects on various Chin-FDDQL domains, which was consistent with the theory of TCM. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a method for the clinical interpretation of the CAT model of TCM syndromes, including evidence derived from the application. It may provide a reference for future interpretation of other CAT models.

AB  - Although many studies have been carried out on the psychometric aspects of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), its psychological aspects are less researched. Early studies claimed that CAT can be more motivating and induce less anxiety than traditional fixed-item tests (FIT). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of CAT on motivation and anxiety in comparison to traditional fixed-item testing. Seven databases were examined. Articles were eligible if they employed an empirical study containing a direct comparison between CAT and FIT. Meta-analytical results showed no overall effect of test type on anxiety and motivation when comparing CAT with FIT (k = 11, g+ = 0.06, p = .28). However, easier CAT had positive effect compared with FIT (k = 2, g+ = .22, p < .001). Certain modifications in CAT administration can provide positive psychological effects for test-takers.

AB  - The usefulness of depression scales for patients with cancer based on item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) has not yet been fully explored. This study thus aimed to develop an IRT-based tool for measuring depression in patients with cancer. We analyzed data from 393 patients with cancer from four tertiary centers in Japan who had not received psychiatric treatment. They answered 62 questions across five categories regarding their psychiatric status over the previous week. We selected 28 items that satisfied the assumptions of IRT, fitted a graded response model to these items, and performed CAT simulations. The CAT simulation used an average of 6.96 items and showed a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.916 (95% confidence interval, 0.899-0.931) between the degree of depression estimated by simulation and that estimated using all 28 items. The measurement precision of CAT with only four items was superior to that of the estimation using the calibrated Patient Health Questionnaire-9. These results imply that this scale is useful and accurate for measuring depression in patients with cancer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), are characterised by impaired development of the early central nervous system, impacting cognitive and/or physical function. Early detection of NDD enables infants to be fast-tracked to early intervention services, optimising outcomes. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants may experience early life factors increasing their risk of neurodevelopmental vulnerability, which persist into later childhood, further compounding the health inequities experienced by First Nations peoples in Australia. The LEAP-CP prospective cohort study will investigate the efficacy of early screening programmes, implemented in Queensland, Australia to earlier identify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants who are 'at risk' of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (NDO) or NDD. Diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of early detection tools for identifying infants 'at risk' of a later diagnosis of adverse NDO or NDD will be determined. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander infants born in Queensland, Australia (birth years 2020-2022) will be invited to participate. Infants aged <9 months corrected age (CA) will undergo screening using the (1) General Movements Assessment (GMA); (2) Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE); (3) Rapid Neurodevelopmental Assessment (RNDA) and (4) Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Aboriginal adaptation (ASQ-TRAK). Developmental outcomes at 12 months CA will be determined for: (1) neurological (HINE); (2) motor (Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2); (3) cognitive and communication (Bayley Scales of Infant Development III); (4) functional capabilities (Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test) and (5) behaviour (Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment). Infants will be classified as typically developing or 'at risk' of an adverse NDO and/or specific NDD based on symptomology using developmental and diagnostic outcomes for (1) CP (2) ASD and (3) FASD. The effects of perinatal, social and environmental factors, caregiver mental health and clinical neuroimaging on NDOs will be investigated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by appropriate Queensland ethics committees; Far North Queensland Health Research Ethics Committee (HREC/2019/QCH/50533 (Sep ver 2)-1370), the Townsville HHS Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/QTHS/56008), the University of Queensland Medical Research Ethics Committee (2020000185/HREC/2019/QCH/50533) and the Children's Health Queensland HHS Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/20/QCHQ/63906) with governance and support from local First Nations communities. Findings from this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12619000969167.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative mood is an important risk factor for poor clinical outcomes among individuals with musculoskeletal pain. Screening for negative mood can aid in identifying those who may need additional psychological interventions. Limitations of current negative mood screening tools include (1) high response burden, (2) a focus on single dimensions of negative mood, (3) poor precision for identifying individuals with low or high negative mood levels, and/or (4) design not specific for use in populations with orthopaedic conditions and musculoskeletal pain. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Can item response theory methods be used to construct screening tools for negative mood (such as depression, anxiety, and anger) in patients undergoing physical therapy for orthopaedic conditions? (2) Do these tools demonstrate reliability and construct validity when used in a clinical setting? METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving outpatients having physical therapy in tertiary-care settings. A total of 431 outpatients with neck (n = 93), shoulder (n = 108), low back (n = 119), or knee (n = 111) conditions were enrolled between December 2014 and December 2015, with 24% (103 of 431) seeking care after orthopaedic surgery. Participants completed three validated psychological questionnaires measuring negative mood, resulting in 39 candidate items for item response theory analysis. Factor analysis was used to identify the dimensions (factors) assessed by the candidate items and select items that loaded on the main factor of interest (negative mood), establishing a unidimensional item set. Unidimensionality of an item set suggests they are assessing one main factor or trait, allowing unbiased score estimates. The identified items were assessed for their fit to the graded item response theory model. This model allows for items to vary by the level of difficulty they represent and by their ability to discriminate between patients at different levels of the trait being assessed, in this case, negative mood. Finally, a hierarchical bifactor model where multiple subfactors are allowed to load on an overall factor was used to confirm that the items identified as representing a unidimensional item set explained the large majority of variance of the overall factor, providing additional support for essential unidimensionality. Using the final item bank, we constructed a computer adaptive test administration mode, and reduced item sets were selected to create short forms including items with the highest information (reliability) at targeted score levels of the trait being measured, while also considering clinical content. RESULTS: We identified a 12-item bank for assessment of negative mood; eight-item and four-item short-form versions were developed to reduce administrative burden. Computer adaptive test administration used a mean +/- SD of 8 +/- 1 items. The item bank's reliability (0 = no reliability; 1 = perfect reliability) was 0.89 for the computer adaptive test administration, 0.86 for the eight-item short form, and 0.71 for the four-item short form. Reliability values equal to or greater than 0.7 are considered acceptable for group level measures. Construct validity sufficient for clinical practice was supported by more severe negative mood scores among individuals with a previous episode of pain in the involved anatomical region, pain and activity limitations during the past 3 months, a work-related injury, education less than a college degree, and income less than or equal to USD 50,000. CONCLUSION: These newly derived tools include short-form and computer adaptive test options for reliable and valid negative mood assessment in outpatient orthopaedic populations. Future research should determine the responsiveness of these measures to change and establish score thresholds for clinical decision-making. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Orthopaedic providers can use these tools to inform prognosis, establish clinical benchmarks, and identify patients who may benefit from psychological and/or behavioral treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are comorbidities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and it is now recommended to screen IBD patients for these conditions. We screened patients using a novel computerized adaptive testing technology and compared the screening results to measures of disease activity. METHODS: Consecutive patients at our tertiary IBD clinic were asked to complete the validated CAT-MH survey (Adaptive Testing Technologies, Chicago, IL); we then reviewed disease and patient characteristics. Clinical remission status was determined based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopy and imaging results. Statistical methods included Fisher's exact test and Pearson Chi-square tests to assess association. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: We included 134 patients, of which 34 (25.3%) screened positive for depression and 18 (13.4%) screened positive for anxiety. We identified 19 (55.9 %) and 10 (55.5%) patients who were previously undiagnosed for depression and anxiety, respectively. Patients in clinical remission were less likely to screen positive for depression (OR 0.19; 95%CI 0.07-0.50) and for anxiety (OR 0.30; 95%CI 0.10-0.91). Compared to patients with negative CRP values, patients with positive CRP were more likely to also screen positive for depression (p=0.025) and anxiety (p=0.15). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of a novel testing technology for screening patients with IBD for depression and anxiety. We found a large number of patients with previously undiagnosed anxiety or depression and a significant positive association between clinically active IBD and these mental health conditions. This work supports and informs recommendations for mental health screening in the IBD population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multidimensional computerized adaptive test, the Functional Assessment in Acute Care Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Test (FAMCAT), could be administered to hospitalized patients via a tablet computer rather than being orally administered by an interviewer. DESIGN: A randomized comparison of the responses of hospitalized patients to interviewer vs tablet delivery of the FAMCAT and its assessment of applied cognition, daily activity, and basic mobility. SETTING: Two quaternary teaching hospitals in the Upper Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 300 patients (127 men, 165 women), average age 61.2 (range, 18-97) hospitalized on medical services or rehospitalized on surgical services were randomly assigned to either a tablet (150) or an interview (150) group. INTERVENTION: Electronic tablet vs interview. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Item response theory point estimates of the FAMCAT latent scales, their psychometric standard errors, number of items administered per domain, the determinant (an indicator of overall precision of the latent trait vector), as well as the time that patients required to complete their FAMCAT sessions. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients, 292 completed their assessments. The assessments of 4 individuals in each group was interrupted by clinical care and were not included in the analyses. A significant (P=.009) mode effect (ie, interview vs tablet) was identified when all outcome variables were considered simultaneously. However, the only outcome that was affected by the administration mode was test duration: tablet administration reduced the roughly 6-minute test time required by both approaches by only 20 seconds, which, though statistically significant, was clinically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of a FAMCAT assessment, at least for this cohort of hospitalized patients, are independent of administration via tablet computer or interview.

BT  - The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume
VL  - NA
ET  - NA
PB  - NA
CY  - NA
KW  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal specialists have the expertise to distinguish between (1) symptoms that correspond well with observed pathophysiology and (2) disproportionate or incongruent symptoms that may suggest mental and social health opportunities. There is evidence that patient verbal and nonverbal communication can help with this discernment. This study carried this line of research one step further by addressing whether patient linguistic tones, as assessed with use of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), are associated with symptoms of depression and health anxiety. We also sought associations between both patient and clinician linguistic tones and patient-perceived clinician empathy. METHODS: A secondary analysis of transcripts of video and audio recordings of 109 adult patients seeking musculoskeletal specialty care was performed. Patients also completed questionnaires quantifying symptoms of depression (PROMIS [Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System] Depression computerized adaptive test), self-efficacy when in pain (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, 2-question version), symptoms of health anxiety (5-item Short Health Anxiety Inventory [SHAI-5]), and perceived clinician empathy (Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy [JSPPPE]). LIWC was used to detect the relative strength of various emotional tones, cognitive processes, and core drives and needs. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses sought factors associated with symptoms of depression, symptoms of health anxiety, and patient perception of clinician empathy. RESULTS: With greater levels of depression, patients express less emotion overall as detected with use of computational linguistic analysis. After accounting for demographic variables, there were no specific linguistic tones associated with health anxiety and symptoms of depression. Stronger negative linguistic tones were associated with lower pain self-efficacy. Greater perceived clinician empathy was associated with more words spoken by the clinician and the patient, greater patient use of adjectives, lower prevalence of patient tones of "analytic," lower clinician tones of "social," and greater tones of "cause." CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal specialists cannot depend on people experiencing symptoms of psychological distress to verbally express their feelings. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Specialists may be more likely to identify important symptoms of psychological distress if they anticipate lower emotional expressiveness and are attentive to specific words, concepts, and mannerisms known to be associated with distress.

AB  - Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are utilized in clinical registries and trials, necessitating development of benchmarks to enhance interpretability. This study aimed to 1) examine if PROMIS measures administered via computer adaptive testing (CAT) were responsive to change, and 2) highlight one method of assessing clinically significant change for youth seen in a tertiary pain clinic. Clinically significant change was achieved if patients had significantly reliable pre-to-post-changes greater than Reliable Change Index (RCI) value and reported decreased symptoms by at least one severity level (e.g., moderate to mild). Participants were 328 youth (8-17 years old) seen in a tertiary pediatric pain management clinic. Small to moderate effect sizes were noted across PROMIS measures (except Peer Relations). Reliable magnitudes of change were estimated for this sample as approximately 6 point reduction for Pain Interference and Mobility, 9 for Fatigue, and 11 for Anxiety and Depression. Depending on the measure, 10 to 24% were categorized as improved, 3 to 6% as deteriorated, and 68 to 81% were either not clinically elevated at baseline or remained unchanged at 3 months. Overall, PROMIS CAT measures demonstrated responsiveness to change over time. Estimation of clinically significant change offers preliminary yet rigorous benchmarks for evaluating treatment response and sets the stage for understanding treatment effects. PERSPECTIVE: This study assesses responsiveness of CAT administered PROMIS measures and highlights one methodological approach of presenting clinical significance for assessing treatment outcomes in pediatric chronic pain. These benchmarks will allow clinicians and researchers to evaluate treatment response utilizing PROs while allowing for a deeper understanding of treatment effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee have a notable variation that does not correspond directly with pathophysiology. The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of location of the arthritis on pain intensity and magnitude of limitations accounting for personal and psychological factors. METHODS: One hundred and fifty four patients with osteoarthritis of the hip (41 patients) or the knee (113 patients) were enrolled in this prospective cross sectional cohort study. Patients answered questionnaires which included demographics, site of arthritis (hip or knee), laterality (unilateral or bilateral), pain intensity, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS PF CAT), and psychologic questionnaires including the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-4), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Dep CAT). Kellgren-Lawrence classification was classified by the treating surgeon. Associations of these factors with pain and function were assessed using bivariate and multivariable regression models. RESULTS: In a multivariable model accounting for potential confounding, magnitude of limitations was independently associated with years of education, work status, time spent exercising, catastrophic thinking (PCS-4), and symptoms of depression. They accounted for 50% of variability in physical function, with the major contributor being catastrophic thinking. The model for pain intensity included time spent exercising and fear of painful movement (TSK-4). Anatomic site and radiographic severity of arthritis were not associated with either physical function or pain in our patient sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that limitations and pain from osteoarthritis of the hip and knee are more closely related to personal and psychological factors, less effective cognitive coping strategies such as catastrophic thinking and kinesiophobia in particular, than to pathological and anatomical factors such as location and severity of arthritis. Care that incorporates incremental correction of common misconceptions that accompany the nociception from osteoarthritis have the potential to improve function and comfort in people with osteoarthritis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite widely appreciated barriers to successful clinical implementation, the literature regarding how to operationalize electronic health record-integrated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) remains sparse. We offer a detailed summary of the implementation of PROs into the standard of care at a major tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: Collection of four Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests was piloted in a large academic orthopaedic surgery ambulatory clinic starting in October 2016. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests (Physical Function, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, and Ability to Return to Social Roles and Activities) were initially implemented as manual order sets to be administered before surgery through 2 years after surgery. Completion rate over time, mean time to completion for all PRO domains, and the overall distribution of symptom severity were used to evaluate the success of the pilot. A subsequent optimization and redesign of the pilot was conducted using tablets, automation of questionnaire deployment, and improved results review to address obstacles encountered during the pilot phase. RESULTS: Two thousand nine distinct joint arthroplasty patients (mean age = 65) completed at least one set of PRO assessments, with overall completion rates reaching 68% and mean completion time of 3 minutes. Focal points during the implementation process included engagement and training of staff, selection of an appropriate patient population and outcome measures, and user friendly data displays for patients and providers. CONCLUSION: Our pilot program successfully demonstrated that PROs can be administered, scored, and made immediately available within the electronic health record to patients and their providers with minimal disruption of clinical workflows. Although considerable operational and technological challenges remain, we found that the implementation of PROs in clinical care within an ambulatory practice at an academic medical center can be achieved through a constellation of several key factors.

AB  - The increasing use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures is forcing clinicians and health care systems to decide which to select and how to incorporate them into their records and clinical workflows. This overview addresses 3 topics related to these concerns. First, a literature review summarizes key psychometric and practical factors (such as reliability, responsiveness, computer adaptive testing, and interpretability) in choosing PROs for clinical practice. Second, 3 clinical decision support issues are highlighted: gathering PROs, electronic health record effect on providers, and incorporating PROs into clinical decision support design and implementation. Lastly, the salience of crosscutting domains as well as 9 key pragmatic decisions are reviewed. Crosscutting domains are those that are relevant across most medical and mental health conditions, such as the SPADE symptom pentad (sleep problems, pain, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue) and physical functioning. The 9 pragmatic decisions include (1) generic vs disease-specific scales; (2) single- vs multidomain scales; (3) universal scales vs user-choice selection; (4) number of domains to measure; (5) prioritization of domains when multiple domains are assessed; (6) action thresholds; (7) clinical purpose (screening vs monitoring); as well as the (8) frequency and (9) logistical aspects of PRO administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to be a responsive and efficient measure for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. While these studies were rigorous in their protocol and methodology, no efforts in recent literature have been made to identify if these reference scores apply to elite athletes. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in the baseline scores of elite athletes versus the general population. We hypothesized that athletes' PROMIS upper extremity general function (PROMIS-UE) and general physical function (PROMIS-PF) scores would vary substantially from the mean health state of the general population. We further hypothesized that these scores would be affected by specific sport and level of competition. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Three PROMIS computer adaptive test (CAT) domains were administered to elite athlete (>/=18 years) volunteers (either in person or through email). An elite athlete was defined as one participating in sports at the collegiate level or higher. Test domains included PROMIS-PF, PROMIS-UE, and pain interference (PROMIS-PI). PROMIS domain t scores were defined and assessed against NIH reference values to identify significant differences. Distribution analysis was conducted using histograms and normality assessments. Domains were also subject to correlation analysis. Finally, subgroup analysis was conducted for all athlete characteristics to identify any factors associated with variance. RESULTS: In total, 196 elite athletes (mean age, 21.1 years; range, 18.0-36.7 years) completed all 3 PROMIS-CAT forms. Overall, the mean scores were 56.0 +/- 6.4, 58.1 +/- 7.7, and 47.1 +/- 7.3 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and PROMIS-PI, respectively. Distribution analysis showed nonnormal distribution for all 3 PROMIS domains (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P < .001). Similarly, in all 3 PROMIS domains the athletes displayed more disparate scores than the NIH-reported reference values (1-way sign test, P < .001). Only the presence of pain and sport played showed association with variance in PROMIS domain scores (P < .001 and P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Elite athletes displayed more disparate reference scores than the NIH-reported average of 50 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and PROMIS-PI. Furthermore, these forms were sensitive to varying levels of sport among collegiate athletes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computerised adaptive testing (CAT) has the potential to transform plastic surgery outcome measurement by making patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) shorter, individualised and more accurate than pen-and-paper questionnaires. OBJECTIVES: This paper reports the results of two optimisation studies for the CLEFT-Q CAT, a CAT intended for use in the field of cleft lip and/or palate. Specifically, we aimed to identify the optimal score estimation and item selection methods for using this CAT in clinical practice. These represent two major components of any CAT algorithm. METHOD: Monte Carlo simulations were performed using simulated data in the R statistical computing environment and incorporated a range of score estimation and item selection techniques. The performance and accuracy of the CAT was assessed by mean items administered, correlation between CAT scores and paired linear assessment scores, and the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of these score pairs. RESULTS: The accuracy of the CLEFT-Q CAT was not significantly affected by the choice of score estimation or item selection method. Sub-scales which originally contain more items were amenable to greater item reduction with CAT. CONCLUSION: This study shows that score estimation and item selection methods that need minimal processing power can be used in the CLEFT-Q CAT without compromising accuracy. This means that the CLEFT-Q CAT could be administered quickly and efficiently with basic hardware demands. We recommend the use of less computationally intensive techniques in future CLEFT-Q CAT studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the relationship between psychological distress and activity tolerance (capability), a stressful life event might diminish accommodation, increase symptoms, and induce a person to seek specialty care. As a first step to investigate this possibility, this study addressed whether difficult life events are associated with greater activity intolerance and pain intensity. METHODS: A cohort of 127 patients seeking specialty care for lower extremity symptoms completed questionnaires that inquired about difficult life events within the last 12 months as derived from the Holmes Rahe Life Stress Inventory, and recorded pain intensity on an 11-point ordinal scale, activity tolerance [Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test (CAT)], symptoms of anxiety (GAD-2; 2 item version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), symptoms of depression (PROMIS Depression CAT), self-efficacy when in pain (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, 2 question version), and demographics. The treating clinician indicated if the disease was established (e.g. arthritis) or relatively new (e.g. sprain/strain). Bivariate and multivariable analyses sought factors associated with activity intolerance and pain intensity. RESULTS: Greater activity intolerance was associated with difficult life events in bivariate analyses (t = 2.13, MD = 3.18, 95% C.I. = 0.22-6.13, p = 0.04) and in multivariable analyses that excluded symptoms of depression. Greater pain intensity was not associated with difficult life events, but was associated with surgeon rating of established disease (beta = 1.20, 95% C.I. = 0.33-2.08, p < 0.01), greater symptoms of anxiety (MD = 3.35, s = 1.72; rho = 0.30, p < 0.01), and less education (beta =  - 1.06, 95% C.I. =  - 1.94- - 0.18, p = 0.02) (no college degree). CONCLUSION: When a musculoskeletal specialist identifies less activity tolerance (less capability) than anticipated for a given injury or pathology, they can anticipate a potential difficult life event, and expect alleviation of symptoms and improved capability as the stress is ameliorated with time and support. Specialists can be prepared to direct people to community or professional support if requested.

KW  - NA
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Suicide has been a leading manner of death for US Air Force personnel in recent years. Universal prevention programs that reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors in military populations have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Wingman-Connect program for Airmen-in-training reduces suicidal ideation, depression, and occupational problems compared with a stress management program and to test the underlying network health model positing that cohesive, healthy units are protective against suicidal ideation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 2017 to October 2019 and compared classes of personnel followed up for 6 months. The setting was a US Air Force technical training school, with participants studied to their first base assignment, whether US or international. Participants in 216 classes were randomized, with an 84% retention rate. Data analysis was performed from November 2019 to May 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The Wingman-Connect program used group skill building for cohesion, shared purpose, and managing career and personal stressors (3 blocks of 2 hours each). Stress management training covered cognitive and behavioral strategies (2 hours). Both conditions had a 1-hour booster session, plus text messages. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were scores on the suicidal ideation and depression scales of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health and self-reports of military occupational impairment. Class network protective factors hypothesized to mediate the effect of Wingman-Connect were assessed with 4 measures: cohesion assessed perceptions that classmates cooperate, work well together, and support each other; morale was measured with a single item used in other studies with military samples; healthy class norms assessed perceptions of behaviors supported by classmates; and bonds to classmates were assessed by asking each participant to name classmates whom they respect and would choose to spend time with. RESULTS: A total of 215 classes including 1485 individuals (1222 men [82.3%]; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [3.1] years) participated; 748 individuals were enrolled in the Wingman-Connect program and 737 individuals were enrolled in the stress management program. At 1 month, the Wingman-Connect group reported lower suicidal ideation severity (effect size [ES], -0.23; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.09; P = .001) and depression symptoms (ES, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.08; P = .002) and fewer occupational problems (ES, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.02; P = .02). At 6 months, the Wingman-Connect group reported lower depression symptoms (ES, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02; P = .03), whereas the difference in suicidal ideation severity was not significant (ES, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.29 to 0.01; P = .06). The number needed to treat to produce 1 fewer participant with elevated depression at either follow-up point was 21. The benefits of the training on occupational problems did not extend past 1 month. The Wingman-Connect program strengthened cohesive, healthy class units, which helped reduce suicidal ideation severity (estimate, -0.035; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; P = .02) and depression symptom scores (estimate, -0.039; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; P = .02) at 1 month. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Wingman-Connect is the first universal prevention program to reduce suicidal ideation and depression symptoms in a general Air Force population. Group training that builds cohesive, healthy military units is promising for upstream suicide prevention and may be essential for ecological validity. Extension of the program to the operational Air Force is recommended for maintaining continuity and testing the prevention impact on suicidal behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) has traditionally focused on motor aspects. The extent to which sensory processing disorders can affect their functional performance and quality of life (QoL) is uncertain. This study aimed to explore the differences in sensory processing between UCP and typical development (TD) children and to analyze the relationship of sensory processing with functional performance and QoL. METHODS: Fifty-three children aged from 6 to 15 years (TD = 24; UCP = 26) were recruited. The Child Sensory Profile 2, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test and Kidscreen were used to evaluate sensory processing, functional performance and QoL. RESULTS: UCP children showed sensory processing difficulties (avoidance: p = 0.02; registration: p = 0.00; body position: p = 0.00; oral: p = 0.02; social-emotional: p = 0.01), and scored lower in functional performance (daily activities: p = 0.00; mobility: p = 0.00; social/cognitive: p = 0.04) and in physical well-being (p = 0.00). The highest correlations in UCP group were found between proprioceptive processing and daily activities and mobility (r = -0.39); auditory, visual and tactile information and school environment (r = -0.63; r = -0.51; r = -0.46); behavioral and social-emotional responses and psychological well-being (r = -0.64; r = -0.49). CONCLUSIONS: UCP children have greater difficulty in sensory processing than TD children. Difficulties in proprioceptive processing contribute to poorer functional performance. Auditory, visual and tactile processing is associated with participation in the school environment and behavioral and social-emotional responses related to sensory processing are associated with the psychological well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences in patient-physician interactions based on physician gender have been demonstrated. However, the association between patients' self-perceived health and their decision to see a female versus male physician is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine if self-reported physical or behavioral health is different in musculoskeletal patients who present to female vs male physicians. We hypothesized that patients who present to female physicians report worse physical and behavioral health. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Consecutive 21 980 adult patients who presented to a musculoskeletal medicine specialist for initial evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition between April 1, 2016 and November 1, 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression Computer Adaptive Test domains of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). The primary study outcome was the mean difference (MD) in PROMIS scores by physician gender. RESULTS: Patients who presented to female physicians self-reported slightly worse health in all domains: Physical Function (female physicians 40.2, male physicians 42.4, MD -2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.5 to -1.8), Pain Interference (female physicians 61.6, male physicians 60.4, MD 1.3 [1.0-1.5]), Anxiety (female physicians 52.5, male physicians 51.4, MD 1.1 [0.8-1.5]), and Depression (female physicians 47.5, male physicians 46.2, MD 1.3 [0.9-1.6]) (all P < .001). Patients who presented to female physicians were also slightly younger (51.9 vs 52.4 years, P = .034) and more likely to be female (63% vs 56%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who presented to female physicians self-reported slightly worse physical and behavioral health compared to those patients who presented to male physicians. Further investigation into this finding may provide insight into drivers of patients' preferences, which may enable physicians of both genders to optimize patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing increased cognitive stimulation or learning opportunities to young children significantly increases cognitive and social-emotional competence later in life. This study aims to determine the acceptability of a pediatric assessment tool to track early child development (ECD) in a rural health district in Limpopo, South Africa. METHODS: A total of 11 primary health nurses from the region in two focus groups were selected to learn and compare two ECD assessment tools: the Cognitive Adaptive Test/Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale (CAT/CLAMS) and Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Data were analyzed using versus coding to compare between the two focus groups and between ASQ and CAT/CLAMS. RESULTS: The major categories that emerged from the discussion were current practice, usability, resource management, cultural adaptation, patient and parent factors, and new knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the challenges related to adapting and implementing ECD assessment in an environment where ECD is largely unknown by local residents, and differs from the environment in which the tool was initially developed. Further work is needed to develop new tools or alter existing tools that can be adapted to diverse settings and cultures.

AB  - Background: FCS significantly affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Legacy patient-reported outcome measures are often not sensitive to FCS's impact. NIH PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures may accurately capture HRQOL in FCS patients. This study assessed a broad range of PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures covering physical, mental, and social HRQOL to determine their suitability for the FCS population.Methods: Adult FCS patients in the United States (N = 25) were recruited to an online survey study and completed several PROMIS short forms and Neuro-QoL computer adaptive tests.Results: Scores were more than 0.5 standard deviations (SD) worse than the normative mean on 10 of 16 normed measures, and more than 0.75 SDs worse than the normative mean on two measures. Responses at the floor and ceiling were occasionally observed, marginal reliabilities were strong, and significant differences across performance status (ps < 0.05) provided preliminary support for construct validity. The measures correlated with each other strongly and as expected.Conclusion: Results support the ability of PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures to detect HRQOL impairment among patients with FCS. PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures captured the functional impact and symptom burden associated with FCS, and the broad range of symptom severity experienced by patients with FCS.

AB  - PURPOSE: Biopsychosocial factors are associated with patient-reported upper extremity disability; however, their impact on postoperative outcomes remains less clear. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that high levels of preoperative patient-reported upper extremity and psychological disability are associated with lower magnitudes of improvement following trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction tendon interposition (LRTI). METHODS: Adult patients undergoing LRTI by fellowship-trained hand surgeons between February 2014 and March 2017 were considered for inclusion. Patient-reported outcomes were collected by tablet computer, including the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference (PI) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT), PROMIS Depression CAT, and PROMIS Anxiety CAT. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with QuickDASH improvement. RESULTS: Of 119 included patients, the mean age was 62.7 +/- 7.2 years and 74% were women. At a mean of 14 weeks after surgery, the QuickDASH improved by a mean of -10 +/- 20 points. The QuickDASH improvement was significantly greater for patients with preoperative QuickDASH scores greater than the median (score change, -19 +/- 20) versus those at or below the median (-2 +/- 16), and for patients with preoperative PI CAT scores greater than the median (-17 +/- 21) versus at or below the median (-4 +/- 17). No differences were observed between groups when Anxiety or Depression CAT baseline scores were similarly dichotomized. Multivariable modelling revealed that higher preoperative QuickDASH scores were associated with greater improvement on the QuickDASH; however, no association was observed for preoperative PI CAT, Depression CAT, and Anxiety CAT scores. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher levels of preoperative upper extremity disability experienced more improvement in the early postoperative period following LRTI. Baseline pain interference, depression, and anxiety were not associated with early outcomes. These findings may be useful when identifying patients who may experience the most functional improvement in the immediate postoperative period following LRTI. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.

AB  - AIMS: Patient engagement in adaptive health behaviours and interactions with their healthcare ecosystem can be measured using self-reported instruments, such as the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) and the Effective Consumer Scale (ECS-17). Few studies have investigated the influence of patient engagement on limitations (patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs). First, we assessed whether patient engagement (PAM-13, ECS-17) within two to four weeks of an upper limb fracture was associated with limitations (the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Upper Extremity Physical Function computer adaptive test (PROMIS UE PF) scores) measured six to nine months after fracture, accounting for demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors. Secondly, we assessed the association between patient engagement and experience (numerical rating scale for satisfaction with care (NRS-C) and satisfaction with services (NRS-S) six to nine months after fracture. METHODS: A total of 744 adults with an isolated fracture of the proximal humerus, elbow, or distal radius completed PROMs. Due to multicollinearity of patient engagement and psychosocial variables, we generated a single variable combining measures of engagement and psychosocial factors using factor analysis. We then performed multivariable analysis with p < 0.10 on bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Patient engagement and psychosocial factors combined to form a single factor (factor 1) accounting for 20% (QuickDASH, semi-partial R(2) = 0.20) and 14% (PROMIS UE PF, semi-partial R(2) = 0.14) of the variation in limitations six to nine months after fracture. Factor 1 also accounted for 17% (NRS-C, semi-partial R(2) = 0.17) of variation in satisfaction with care, and 21% (NRS-S, semi-partial R(2) = 0.21) of variation in satisfaction with services. Demographic factors (age, sex, work status) and measures of greater pathophysiology (type of fracture, high-energy injury, post-surgical complications), accounted for much less variation. CONCLUSION: Patients who actively manage their health and demonstrate effective emotional and social functioning share a common underlying trait. They have fewer limitations and greater satisfaction with care during recovery from upper limb fractures. Future efforts should focus on evaluating initiatives that optimize patient engagement, such as patient education, coaching, and a communication strategy for healthcare professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive chronic disease characterized by airflow obstruction that leads to shortness of breath and substantial negative impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQL). The course of COPD includes periodic acute exacerbations that require changes in treatment and/or hospitalizations. This study was designed to examine the responsiveness of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System(R) (PROMIS(R)) measures to changes associated with COPD exacerbation recovery. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis using mixed-effects models was conducted of people who were enrolled while stable (n = 100) and those who experienced an acute exacerbation (n = 85). PROMIS (physical function, pain interference, pain behavior, fatigue, anxiety, depression, anger, social roles, discretionary social activities, Global Health, dyspnea severity and dyspnea functional limitations) and COPD-targeted HRQL measures were completed at baseline and at 12 weeks. RESULTS: We administered PROMIS measures using computer adaptive testing (CAT), followed by administration of any remaining short form (SF) items that had not yet been administered by CAT. Examination of the difference between group differences from baseline to 12 weeks in the stable and exacerbation groups revealed that the exacerbation group changed (improved) significantly more than the stable group in anxiety (p < .001 to p < .01; f(2) effect size [ES] = 0.023/0.021), fatigue (p < .0001; ES = 0.036/0.047) and social roles (p < .001 to p < .05; ES = 0.035/0.024). All effect sizes were small in magnitude and smaller than hypothesized. Depression was also statistically significant (p < .05, SF only) but the ES was trivial. For all other PROMIS domains, the differences were not significant and ES were trivial. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study provides some support for the validity of the PROMIS fatigue, anxiety, and social roles domains in COPD, but further evaluation of responsiveness is warranted.

VL  - 33 Suppl 7
ET  - NA

KW  - NA
AB  - The rise of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement across medicine has been swift and now extends to the world of orthopedic trauma. However, PRO measures (PROMs) applied to trauma patients pose special considerations; measuring "episodes of care" is less straightforward, injuries are heterogeneous in their severity, and the patient's initial visit is "postinjury." Obtaining baseline scores and assessing the impact of a traumatic event on mental health are key considerations. Currently, few, if any, trauma registries include PROs; though general and condition-specific PROMs plus the patient empowerment measure of Patient Activation represent meaningful inputs for the clinical decision-making process. To be useful in trauma care, PROMs should be psychometrically sound and validated, be used for capturing function, screen for mental state and substance use, and give the clinician a sense of the patient's "activation" (engagement in their own health). Although the implementation of routine PRO collection can seem daunting, clinicians can use a multitude of electronic resources to access validated measures and simplify the implementation process. Computer-adaptive testing has evolved to help minimize patient burden, and PROM collection must maximize efficiency. Once established as part of your practice, PROs become an important tool to track recovery, identify mental health issues, engage in the prevention of future injury, and enable care of the whole patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncology practice can be enhanced by the integration of the assessment of patient-reported symptoms and concerns into the electronic health record (EHR) and clinical workflows. METHODS: Adult oncology outpatients (n = 6825) received 38,422 invitations to complete assessments through the EHR patient portal. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests were administered to assess fatigue, pain interference, physical function, depression, and anxiety. Checklists identified psychosocial, nutritional, and informational needs. In real time, assessment results were populated in the EHR, and clinicians were notified of elevated symptoms and needs. RESULTS: In all, 3521 patients (51.6%) completed 8162 assessments; approximately 55% of the responding patients completed 2 or more within 32 months. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression scores were comparable to those of the general population (approximately 5% of assessments triggered clinical alerts across those domains); mean scores indicated a lower level of physical function (with severe scores prompting alerts in nearly 5% of assessments). More than half of assessments triggered an alert based on patient endorsement of supportive care needs, with the majority of those being nutritional (41.82% of assessments). Patient endorsement of supportive care needs was associated with significantly higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain interference scores and lower physical function scores. Patients who triggered clinical alerts tended to be younger and more recently diagnosed, to have greater comorbidities, and to be a racial/ethnic minority. Patients who triggered clinical alerts had more health care service encounters in the ensuing month. CONCLUSIONS: EHR integration facilitated the assessment and reporting of patient-reported symptoms and needs within routine oncology outpatient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex interrelationship among physical health, mental health, and social health has gained the attention of the medical community in recent years. Poor social health, also called social deprivation, has been linked to more disease and a more-negative impact from disease across a wide variety of health conditions. However, it remains unknown how social deprivation is related to physical and mental health in patients presenting for orthopaedic care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do patients living in zip codes with higher social deprivation report lower levels of physical function and higher levels of pain interference, depression, and anxiety as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) at initial presentation to an orthopaedic provider than those from less deprived areas; and if so, is this relationship independent of other potentially confounding factors such as age, sex, and race? (2) Does the relationship between the level of social deprivation of a patient's community and that patient's physical function, pain interference, depression, and anxiety, as measured by PROMIS remain consistent across all orthopaedic subspecialties? (3) Are there differences in the proportion of individuals from areas of high and low levels of social deprivation seen by the various orthopaedic subspecialties at one large, tertiary orthopaedic referral center? METHODS: This cross-sectional evaluation analyzed 7500 new adult patients presenting to an orthopaedic center between August 1, 2016 and December 15, 2016. Patients completed PROMIS Physical Function-v1.2, Pain Interference-v1.1, Depression-v1.0, and Anxiety-v1.0 Computer Adaptive Tests. The Area Deprivation Index, a composite measure of community-level social deprivation, based on multiple census metrics such as income, education level, and housing type for a given nine-digit zip code was used to estimate individual social deprivation. Statistical analysis determined the effect of disparate area deprivation (based on most- and least-deprived national quartiles) for the entire sample as well as for patients categorized by the orthopaedic subspecialty providing care. Comparisons of PROMIS scores among these groups were based on an MCID of 5 points for each PROMIS domain (Effect size 0.5). RESULTS: Patients living in zip codes with the highest levels of social deprivation had worse mean scores across all four PROMIS domains when compared with those living in the least-deprived quartile (physical function 38 +/- 9 versus 43 +/- 9, mean difference 4, 95% CI, 3.7-5.0; p < 0.001; pain interference 64 +/- 8 versus 60+/-8, mean difference -4, 95% CI, -4.8 to -3.7; p < 0.001; depression 50+/-11 versus 45+/-8, mean difference -5, 95% CI, -6.0 to -4.5; p < 0.001; anxiety 56+/-11 versus 50 +/-10, mean difference -6, 95% CI, -6.9 to -5.4; p < 0.001). There were no differences in physical function, pain interference, depression, or anxiety PROMIS scores between patients from the most- and least-deprived quartiles who presented to the subspecialties of spine (physical function, mean 35+/-7 versus 35+/-7; p = 0.872; pain interference, 67+/-7 versus 66+/-7; p = 0.562; depression, 54+/-12 versus 51 +/-10; p = 0.085; and anxiety, 60+/-11 versus 58 +/-9; p = 0.163), oncology (physical function, mean 33+/-9 versus 38 +/-13; p = 0.105; pain interference, 68+/-9 versus 64+/-10; p = 0.144; depression, 51+/-10 versus 52+/-13; p = 0.832; anxiety, 59+/-11 versus 59+/-10 p = 0.947); and trauma (physical function, 35+/-11 versus 32+/-10; p = 0.268; pain interference, 66+/-7 versus 67+/-6; p = 0.566; depression, 52+/-12 versus 53+/-11; p = 0.637; and anxiety, 59+/-12 versus 60+/-9 versus; p = 0.800). The social deprivation-based differences in all PROMIS domains remained for the subspecialties of foot/ankle, where mean differences ranged from 3 to 6 points on the PROMIS domains (p < 0.001 for all four domains), joint reconstruction where mean differences ranged from 4 to 7 points on the PROMIS domains (p < 0.001 for all four domains), sports medicine where mean differences in PROMIS scores ranged from 3 to 5 between quartiles (p < 0.001 for all four domains), and finally upper extremity where mean differences in PROMIS scores between the most- and least-deprived quartiles were five points for each PROMIS domain (p < 0.001 for all four domains). The proportion of individuals from the most- and least-deprived quartiles was distinct when looking across all seven subspecialty categories; only 11% of patients presenting to sports medicine providers and 17% of patients presenting to upper extremity providers were from the most-deprived quartile, while 39% of trauma patients were from the most-deprived quartile (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic patients must be considered within the context of their social environment because it influences patient-reported physical and mental health as well as has potential implications for treatment and prognosis. Social deprivation may need to be considered when using patient-reported outcomes to judge the value of care delivered between practices or across specialties. Further studies should examine potential interventions to improve the perceived health of patients residing in communities with greater social deprivation and to determine how social health influences ultimate orthopaedic treatment outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) Network has developed a comprehensive repository of electronic patient reported outcomes measures (ePROs) of major symptom domains that have been validated in cancer patients. Their use for patients with gynecologic cancer has been understudied. Our objective was to establish feasibility and acceptability of PROMIS ePRO integration in a gynecologic oncology outpatient clinic and assess if it can help identify severely symptomatic patients and increase referral to supportive services. METHODS: English-speaking patients with a confirmed history of gynecologic cancer completed PROMIS ePROs on iPads in the waiting area of an outpatient gynecologic oncology clinic. Symptom scores were calculated for each respondent and grouped using documented severity thresholds. Response data was compared with clinicopathologic characteristics across symptom domains. Severely symptomatic patients were offered referral to ancillary services and asked to complete post-exposure surveys assessing acceptability of the ePRO. RESULTS: Of the 336 patients who completed ePROs, 35% had active disease and 19% had experienced at least one disease recurrence. Sixty-nine percent of the cohort demonstrated moderate to severe physical dysfunction (60%), pain (36%), fatigue (28%), anxiety (9%), depression (8%), and sexual dysfunction (32%). Thirty-nine (12%) severely symptomatic patients were referred to services such as psychiatry, palliative care, pain management, social work or integrative oncology care. Most survey respondents identified the ePROs as helpful (78%) and easy to complete (92%). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient PROMIS ePRO administration is feasible and acceptable to gynecologic oncology patients and can help identify severely symptomatic patients for referral to ancillary support services.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: This study develops psychometrically valid item banks across 10 areas of quality of life (QoL) specific to people with hereditary retinal diseases, which will enable clinicians and researchers to explore the impact of hereditary retinal diseases across all aspects of QoL. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of hereditary retinal disease QoL item banks using Rasch analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system in obtaining precise measurement of QoL using only a few items. METHODS: The hereditary retinal disease item banks were answered by 233 participants (median age, 58 years; range, 18 to 94 years; female participants, 59%). The hereditary retinal disease item banks cover 10 QoL domains: activity limitation, mobility, emotional, social, convenience, economic, health concerns, visual symptoms, ocular comfort symptoms, and general symptoms. Rasch analysis assessed the psychometric properties of the 10 item banks and provided item calibrations for the development of CAT. Computerized adaptive testing simulations were performed to calculate the average number of items required to gain precise measurement of each QoL domain. RESULTS: The convenience, economic, visual symptoms, and the social domains formed unidimensional scales. However, the activity limitation and health concerns domains demonstrated multidimensionality and required major modifications to resolve this, which resulted in four new QoL domains, namely, reading, driving, lighting, and concerns about the disease progression. In total, 10 item banks underwent CAT simulation testing, which indicated that 8 to 12 items were required to gain precise measurement of each QoL domain. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed 10 psychometrically valid item banks to measure the QoL domains relevant to people with hereditary retinal diseases. On average, only 5 and 10 items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with brain tumors can experience symptom burden throughout their disease continuum. The aim of the study was to evaluate symptom burden reported by children with brain tumors and factors that potentially were associated with their symptoms. METHODS: Data from 199 children with brain tumors aged 7-22 (mean age = 14 years; 52% males; 76% white) were analyzed. Symptom burden was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) via computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-anxiety, depression, fatigue, mobility, upper extremity function, peer relationship, and cognition. Patients and parents completed Symptom Distress Scales (SDS). Test statistics and ANOVA were used to evaluate relationships between PROMIS measures and potentially influential variables. RESULTS: Significant results (P < 0.01) showing impact of symptom burden included: PROMIS measures correlated with SDSs reported by patients and parents on all comparisons. Fatigue, mobility, and upper extremity function were associated with Karnofsky functional performance status, number of treatment modalities (0-3), and time since last treatment (</=1 year, >1 year). Fatigue and cognition were associated with educational program (regular classroom without an individualized education plan vs those that had an individualized education plan); mobility and upper extremity function were associated with time since last radiation. Mobility, upper extremity function, and anxiety were associated with time since last chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations were found between PROMIS and SDS as well as clinical and demographic characteristics. Brief-yet-precise PROMIS CATs can be used to systematically assess symptom burden experienced by children with brain tumors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new patient-reported outcome measure that captures feelings of being trapped that are commonly experienced by caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of civilians with TBI (n=344) and caregivers of service members/veterans with TBI (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. OUTCOME MEASURES: Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Feeling Trapped item bank. RESULTS: From an initial item pool of 28 items, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the retention of 16 items. After graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning analyses were conducted, 15 items were retained in the final measure. GRM calibration data, along with clinical expert input, were used to choose a 6-item, static short form (SF), and the calibration data were used for programming of the TBI-CareQOL Feeling Trapped computer adaptive test (CAT). CAT simulation analyses produced an r=0.99 correlation between CAT scores and the full item bank. Three-week short-form test-retest reliability was very good (r=0.84). CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Feeling Trapped item bank was developed to provide a sensitive and efficient examination of the effect that feelings of being trapped, due to the caregiver role, have on health-related quality of life for caregivers of individuals with TBI. Both the CAT and corresponding 6-item SF demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. Future work is needed to establish the responsiveness of this measure to clinical interventions for these caregivers.

AB  - PURPOSE: Social, mental, and physical health have a complex interrelationship with each influencing individuals' overall health experience. Social circumstances have been shown to influence symptom intensity and magnitude of disability for a variety of medical conditions. We tested the null hypothesis that social deprivation would not impact Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores or objective health factors in patients presenting for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 367 patients who presented for evaluation of CTS to 1 of 6 hand surgeons at a tertiary academic center between August 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. Patients completed PROMIS Physical Function-v1.2, Pain Interference-v1.1, Depression-v1.0, and Anxiety-v1.0 Computer Adaptive Tests. The Area Deprivation Index was used to quantify social deprivation. Medical record review determined duration of symptoms, tobacco and opioid use, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for each patient. Sample demographics, PROMIS scores, and objective health measures were compared in groups defined by national quartiles of social deprivation. RESULTS: Patients with CTS living in the most deprived quartile had worse mean scores across all 4 PROMIS domains compared with those living in the least deprived quartile. A higher proportion of individuals from the most deprived quartile had a heightened level of anxiety than those in the least deprived quartile (37.3% vs 12.6%). The mean CCI was higher in the most deprived quartile, as was the proportion of individuals using tobacco. There were no differences in opioid use or symptom duration between patients from each deprivation quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Social deprivation is associated with worse patient-reported health measures in patients with CTS. Compared with those from the least deprived areas, patients from the most deprived areas also have a greater comorbidity burden and higher rates of tobacco use at presentation to a hand surgeon.

AB  - Background: Patient-reported outcome measures vary more than expected based on underlying pathology, in part due to the substantial influence of mood and coping strategies. Methods: This study addressed the primary null hypothesis that the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function score 1 month (range, 3-8 weeks) after hand surgery is not associated with PROMIS Depression and PROMIS Pain Interference scores prior to surgery, accounting for other factors. Using an institution-wide database of routinely collected patient-reported outcomes, we identified adult patients who underwent wrist ganglion excision, trapeziometacarpal arthroplasty, hand ganglion excision, trigger digit, De Quervain, and carpal tunnel release. Measures collected included the PROMIS Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT), PROMIS Pain Interference CAT, and PROMIS Depression CAT. We sought factors associated with postsurgical PROMIS Physical Function scores and change between preoperative and postoperative score using multivariable linear regression, accounting for age, sex, surgery type, provider, and time from surgery to postsurgical measurement. Results: Higher postoperative PROMIS Physical Function score was independently associated with lower PROMIS Pain Interference scores, lower PROMIS Depression scores, younger age, and treatment by provider team 3. Greater change in PROMIS Physical Function score was independently associated with greater PROMIS Pain Interference scores, greater time from surgery, and treatment by provider team 3. Conclusions: Mood and effective coping strategies affect the level of symptoms and limitations during recovery from hand surgery and represent important treatment opportunities for enhancing recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear avoidance can play a prominent role in maladaptive responses to an injury. In injured athletes, such pain-related fear or fear avoidance behavior may have a substantial influence on the recovery process. Specifically, it may explain why some are able to reach their preinjury abilities, whereas others are unable to return to sport. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is fear avoidance in athletes associated with decreased physical function after injury? (2) To what degree is fear avoidance associated with athletes' pain intensity? METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we recruited injured athletes-defined as patients with sports-related injury, weekly engagement in sport activities, participation in competitive events as part of a team or club, self-identification as an athlete, and a desire to return to sport after recovery-from an orthopaedic sports medicine center at a major urban university hospital. Of 130 approached patients, 102 (84% men; mean +/- SD age 25 +/- 8.5 years) met the inclusion criteria. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Athlete Fear Avoidance Questionnaire, which assesses injury-related fear and avoidance behavior specifically in an athletic population, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and two Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures: Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) and Pain Intensity CAT. RESULTS: After controlling for age, injury region (upper versus lower extremity), catastrophic thinking, and emotional distress, we found that an increase in athletes' fear avoidance was associated with a decrease in physical function (b = -0.32; p = 0.002). The model explained 30% of the variation in physical function with 7.3% explained uniquely by fear avoidance. After controlling for initial appointment/followup, surgery for the current condition, multiple pain conditions, history of prior sport-related injury/surgery, pain medication prescription, catastrophic thinking, and emotional distress, athletes' fear avoidance was not associated with pain (b = -0.14; p = 0.249). The model explained 40% of the variation in pain intensity and pain catastrophizing (b = 0.30; p = 0.001) uniquely explained 7.1% of this variation. CONCLUSIONS: In injured athletes, fear avoidance is independently associated with decreased physical function, whereas pain catastrophizing is associated with high pain intensity. Both level of an athlete's fear avoidance and catastrophic thinking about pain should be accounted for in clinical interventions aimed at helping athletes improve recovery and return to sport. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate functional outcomes and evaluate predictors of an unfavorable functional outcome in children following a critical illness. DESIGN: Prospective observational longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Two tertiary care, Canadian PICUs: McMaster Children's Hospital and London Health Sciences. PATIENTS: Children 12 months to 17 years old, admitted to PICU for at least 48 hours with one or more organ dysfunction, were eligible. Patients not expected to survive, direct transfers from neonatal ICU and patients in whom long-term follow-up would not be able to be conducted, were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was functional outcome up to 6 months post PICU discharge, measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disabilities Inventory Computer Adaptive Test. Secondary outcomes included predictors of unfavorable functional outcome, caregiver stress, health-related quality-of-life, and clinical outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, and PICU-acquired complications. One hundred eighty-two patients were enrolled; 78 children (43.6%) had functional limitations at baseline and 143 (81.5%) experienced functional deterioration following critical illness. Ninety-two (67.1%) demonstrated some functional recovery by 6 months. Higher baseline function and a neurologic insult at PICU admission were the most significant predictors of functional deterioration. Higher baseline function and increasing age were associated with slower functional recovery. Different factors affect the domains of functioning differently. Preexisting comorbidities and iatrogenic PICU-acquired morbidities were associated with persistent requirement for caregiver support (responsibility function) at 6 months. The degree of functional deterioration after critical illness was a significant predictor of increased hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new information regarding functional outcomes and the factors that influence meaningful aspects of functioning in critically ill children. Identifying patients at greatest risk and modifiable targets for improvement in PICU care guides us in developing strategies to improve functional outcomes and tailor to the rehabilitation needs of these patients and their families.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) quality-of-life (QoL) item banks and determine the utility of the final calibrated item banks by simulating a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) application. METHODS: In this clinical, cross-sectional study, 514 participants with DR/DME (mean age +/- SD, 60.4 +/- 12.6 years; 64% male) answered 314 items grouped under nine QoL item pools: Visual Symptoms (SY); Ocular Comfort Symptoms (OS); Activity Limitation (AL); Mobility (MB); Emotional (EM); Health Concerns (HC); Social (SC); Convenience (CV); and Economic (EC). The psychometric properties of the item pools were assessed using Rasch analysis, and CAT simulations determined the average number of items administered at high and moderate precision levels. RESULTS: The SY, MB, EM, and HC item pools required minor amendments, mainly involving removal of six poorly worded, highly misfitting items. AL and CV required substantial modification to resolve multidimensionality, which resulted in two new item banks: Driving (DV) and Lighting (LT). Due to unresolvable psychometric issues, the OS, SC, and EC item pools were not pursued further. This iterative process resulted in eight operational item banks that underwent CAT simulations. Correlations between CAT and the full item banks were high (range, 0.88-0.99). On average, only 3.6 and 7.2 items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our eight psychometrically robust and efficient DR/DME item banks will enable researchers and clinicians to accurately assess the impact and effectiveness of treatment therapies for DR/DME in all areas of QoL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2009, the Army Pain Management Task Force was chartered. On the basis of their findings, the Department of Defense recommended a comprehensive pain management strategy that included development of a standardized pain assessment system that would collect patient-reported outcomes data to inform the patient-provider clinical encounter. The result was the Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR). The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and response burden of the patient-reported outcome measures in PASTOR. METHODS: Data for analyses were collected from 681 individuals who completed PASTOR at baseline and follow-up as part of their routine clinical care. The survey tool included self-report measures of pain severity and pain interference (measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System [PROMIS] and the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating scale). PROMIS measures of pain correlates also were administered. Validation analyses included estimation of score associations among measures, comparison of scores of known groups, responsiveness, ceiling and floor effects, and response burden. RESULTS: Results of psychometric testing provided substantial evidence for the validity of PASTOR self-report measures in this population. Expected associations among scores largely supported the concurrent validity of the measures. Scores effectively distinguished among respondents on the basis of their self-reported impressions of general health. PROMIS measures were administered using computer adaptive testing and each, on average, required less than 1 minute to administer. Statistical and graphical analyses demonstrated the responsiveness of PASTOR measures over time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative developed an array of patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. To reduce the number of questions administered, PROMIS utilizes unidimensional item response theory and unidimensional computer adaptive testing (UCAT), which means a separate set of questions is administered for each measured trait. Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) and multidimensional computer adaptive testing (MCAT) simultaneously assess correlated traits. The objective was to investigate the extent to which MCAT reduces patient burden relative to UCAT in the case of PROs. METHODS: One MIRT and 3 unidimensional item response theory models were developed using the related traits anxiety, depression, and anger. Using these models, MCAT and UCAT performance was compared with simulated individuals. RESULTS: Surprisingly, the root mean squared error for both methods increased with the number of items. These results were driven by large errors for individuals with low trait levels. A second analysis focused on individuals aligned with item content. For these individuals, both MCAT and UCAT accuracies improved with additional items. Furthermore, MCAT reduced the test length by 50%. DISCUSSION: For the PROMIS Emotional Distress banks, neither UCAT nor MCAT provided accurate estimates for individuals at low trait levels. Because the items in these banks were designed to detect clinical levels of distress, there is little information for individuals with low trait values. However, trait estimates for individuals targeted by the banks were accurate and MCAT asked substantially fewer questions. CONCLUSION: By reducing the number of items administered, MCAT can allow clinicians and researchers to assess a wider range of PROs with less patient burden.

AB  - The current study investigated the utility and validity of a computerized "depression" module of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Second version (MMPI-2), with and without sequential testing rules, with a college student sample. Participants completed one of three MMPI-2 test-retest administrations (i.e., conventional-conventional, conventional-module, or conventional-sequential module) as well as 15 criterion measures across two testing sessions exactly 1 week apart. The findings pointed to statistically significant and clinically meaningful time-savings in administering selected MMPI-2 scales (for both full-length and variable-length versions). Criterion measures rationally selected to represent similar (depression, anhedonia, anxiety) and dissimilar (behavioral, thought, and somatic dysfunction) psychological constructs were administered to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the depression module. The criterion correlations suggested minimal differences in discriminant and convergent validity across administration modes, suggesting limited to no impact of administering targeted MMPI-2 scales in terms of construct validity.

AB  - The development of the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory (ESI) was motivated by the need to comprehensively assess the interrelated nature of externalizing psychopathology and personality using an empirically driven framework. The ESI measures 23 theoretically distinct yet related unidimensional facets of externalizing, which are structured under 3 superordinate factors representing general externalizing, callous aggression, and substance abuse. One limitation of the ESI is its length at 415 items. To facilitate the use of the ESI in busy clinical and research settings, the current study sought to examine the efficiency and accuracy of a computerized adaptive version of the ESI. Data were collected over 3 waves and totaled 1,787 participants recruited from undergraduate psychology courses as well as male and female state prisons. A series of 6 algorithms with different termination rules were simulated to determine the efficiency and accuracy of each test under 3 different assumed distributions. Scores generated using an optimal adaptive algorithm evidenced high correlations (r > .9) with scores generated using the full ESI, brief ESI item-based factor scales, and the 23 facet scales. The adaptive algorithms for each facet administered a combined average of 115 items, a 72% decrease in comparison to the full ESI. Similarly, scores on the item-based factor scales of the ESI-brief form (57 items) were generated using on average of 17 items, a 70% decrease. The current study successfully demonstrates that an adaptive algorithm can generate similar scores for the ESI and the 3 item-based factor scales using a fraction of the total item pool.

AB  - Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for positive and negative psychotic experiences were developed and tested in N = 5705 help-seeking, non-psychotic young individuals. Instead of presenting all items, CATs choose a varying number of different items during test administration depending on respondents' previous answers, reducing the average number of items while still obtaining accurate person estimates. We assessed the appropriateness of two-parameter logistic models to positive and negative symptoms of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ), computed measurement precision of all items and resulting adaptive tests along psychotic dimensions by Real Data Simulations (RDS), and computed indices for criterion and predictive validities of the CATs. For all items, mean absolute differences between observed and expected response probabilities were smaller than 0.02. CAT-POS predicted transition to psychosis and duration of hospitalization in individuals at-risk for psychosis, and CAT-NEG was suggestively related to later functioning. Regarding psychosis risk classifications of help-seeking individuals, CAT-POS performed less than the PQ-16. Adaptive testing based on self-reported positive and negative symptoms in individuals at-risk for psychosis is a feasible method to select patients for further risk classification. These promising findings need to be replicated prospectively in a non-selective sample that also includes non-at-risk individuals. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the precision and construct validity of pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments in a population of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients and parent proxies. METHODS: A convenience sample of JIA patients and parents of JIA patients completed PROMIS instruments for 8 domains: anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, mobility, pain interference, peer relationships, and upper-extremity function. Short form and computerized adaptive test (CAT) scores were derived from item bank responses. Raw scores were translated to standardized T scores with corresponding SEs. Discrimination between inactive versus active disease was evaluated as an indicator of each measure's construct validity. SEs were plotted to evaluate each instrument's relative precision. Patient-parent concordance was assessed using intraclass correlations (ICCs). RESULTS: A total of 228 patients and 223 parents participated, providing 71-78 responses per domain. Patient- and parent-reported anger, fatigue, mobility, and pain interference scores significantly differed between those with inactive and active disease. Anxiety, depressive symptoms, and peer relationships differed by disease activity levels for parent-report only. Short forms and CATs provided comparable reliability to the full item banks across the full range of each outcome. Patient-parent agreement ranged from ICC 0.3 to 0.8. CATs did not reduce the number of items for any domain compared to the short form. CONCLUSION: Precision and discriminatory abilities of PROMIS instruments depend on health domain and report type (self-report versus parent proxy-report) for children with JIA. Varying levels of patient-parent concordance reinforces the importance of considering both perspectives in comprehensive health outcomes assessments.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), back pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and cancer completed PROMIS negative affect instruments as computerized adaptive test or as fixed-length short form at baseline and a clinically relevant follow-up interval. Participants also completed global ratings of health. Linear mixed effects models and standardized response means (SRM) were estimated at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 903 individuals participated (back pain, n = 218; cancer, n = 304; CHF, n = 60; COPD, n = 125; MDD, n = 196). All three negative affect instruments improved significantly for treatments of depression and pain. Depression improved for CHF patients (anxiety and anger not administered), whereas anxiety improved significantly in COPD groups (stable and exacerbation). Response to treatment was not assessed in cancer. Subgroups of patients reporting better or worse health showed a corresponding positive or negative average SRM for negative affect across samples. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the PROMIS negative affect scores are sensitive to change in intervention studies in which negative affect is expected to change. These results inform the estimation of meaningful change and enable comparative effectiveness research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients and surgeons can feel uncomfortable discussing coping strategies, psychological distress, and stressful circumstances. It has been suggested that patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) facilitate the discussion of factors associated with increased symptoms and disability. This study assessed the effect of providing feedback to patients regarding their coping strategy and illness behavior on patient satisfaction and patient-physician communication in orthopedic surgery. METHODS: In a prospective study, 136 orthopedic patients were randomly assigned to either receive feedback about the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference computer-adaptive test (CAT) prior to the visit with the hand surgeon or not. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction with the consultation and secondary outcomes involved patient-physician communication. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the influence of the feedback on patient satisfaction and communication. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between patients who received feedback and patients who did not (P = 0.70). Feedback was associated with more frequent discussion of coping strategies (P = 0.045) in bivariate analysis but was not independently associated: in multivariable analysis, only PROMIS Pain Interference CAT and age were identified as independent predictors (odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.0-1.1, P = 0.013, and OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.032, respectively). No factors were associated with discussion of stressors. Discussion of circumstances was independently associated with increased PROMIS Pain Interference CAT, marital status, and work status. CONCLUSION: We found that feedback regarding coping strategies and illness behavior using the PROMIS Pain Interference CAT did not affect patient satisfaction. Although feedback was associated with increased discussion of illness behavior in bivariate analysis, less effective coping strategies and personal factors (age, marital status, and work status) were more important factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an item response theory (IRT)-calibrated spinal cord injury (SCI)-specific Positive Affect and Well-being (PAWB) item bank with flexible options for administration. DESIGN: Qualitative feedback from patient and provider focus groups was used to expand on the Neurological Disorders and Quality of Life (Neuro-QOL) positive affect & well-being item bank for use in SCI. New items were created and revised based on expert review and patient feedback and were then field tested. Analyses included confirmatory factor analysis, graded response IRT modeling and evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF). SETTING: We tested a 32-item pool at several rehabilitation centers across the United States, including the University of Michigan, Kessler Foundation, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the University of Washington, Craig Hospital and the James J. Peters/Bronx Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 717 individuals with SCI answered the PAWB questions. RESULTS: A unidimensional model was observed (Confirmatory Fit Index=0.947; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation=0.094) and measurement precision was good (reliability in theta of -2.9 to 1.2 is roughly equivalent to classical reliability of 0.95 or above). Twelve items were flagged for DIF, however, after examination of effect sizes, the DIF was determined to be negligible and would have little practical impact on score estimates. The final calibrated item bank resulted in 28 retained items CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the Spinal Cord Injury--Quality of Life PAWB bank represents a psychometrically robust measurement tool. Short form items are also suggested and a computer adaptive test is available.

AB  - CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: The Spinal Cord Injury--Quality of Life (SCI-QOL) measurement system was developed to address the shortage of relevant and psychometrically sound patient reported outcome (PRO) measures available for clinical care and research in spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Using a computer adaptive testing (CAT) approach, the SCI-QOL builds on the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) initiative. This initial manuscript introduces the background and development of the SCI-QOL measurement system. Greater detail is presented in the additional manuscripts of this special issue. DESIGN: Classical and contemporary test development methodologies were employed. Qualitative input was obtained from individuals with SCI and clinicians through interviews, focus groups, and cognitive debriefing. Item pools were field tested in a multi-site sample (n=877) and calibrated using item response theory methods. Initial reliability and validity testing was performed in a new sample of individuals with traumatic SCI (n=245). SETTING: Five Model SCI System centers and one Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with traumatic SCI. INTERVENTIONS: n/a OUTCOME MEASURES: n/a RESULTS: The SCI-QOL consists of 19 item banks, including the SCI-Functional Index banks, and 3 fixed-length scales measuring physical, emotional, and social aspects of health-related QOL (HRQOL). CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL measurement system consists of psychometrically sound measures for individuals with SCI. The manuscripts in this special issue provide evidence of the reliability and initial validity of this measurement system. The SCI-QOL also links to other measures designed for a general medical population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the psychometric properties of the 23-item version of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-23) and to quantify their stability across 2 cultures/languages and 2 types of care-settings. METHODS: Rasch analysis of data from 1,000 patients with low back pain from primary care (UK and Denmark) and secondary care (Denmark). RESULTS: The RMDQ-23 is unidimensional if local item dependency issues are accommodated, but contains several misfitting or overdiscriminating items, some poor targeting of items, and the scoring of 4-5 items is differentially affected by common clinical characteristics (such as age, gender, pain intensity, pain duration and care setting), depending on the country. CONCLUSION: As similar results have been found for the RMDQ-24, we believe it is timely to reconsider whether: (i) the RMDQ should be reconstructed using an item-response theory-based approach that includes consideration of new items and response options; or (ii) the use of alternative questionnaires should be recommended, such as the Oswestry Disability Index, that have shown evidence of fitting the Rasch model; or (iii) a completely new condition-specific questionnaire should be developed, perhaps utilizing a computerized adaptive testing platform.

AB  - Patient self-reported symptoms are of crucial importance to identify anxiety disorders, as well as to monitor their treatment in clinical practice and research. Thus, for evidence-based medicine, a precise, reliable, and valid (ie, "objective") assessment of the patient's reported "subjective" symptoms is warranted. There is a plethora of instruments available, which can provide psychometrically sound assessments of anxiety, but there are several limitations of current tools that need to be carefully considered for their successful use. Nevertheless, the empirical assessment of mental health status is not as accepted in medicine as is the assessment of biomarkers. One reason for this may be that different instruments assessing the same psychological construct use different scales. In this paper we present some new developments that promise to provide one common metric for the assessment of anxiety, to facilitate the general acceptance of mental health assessments in the future.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The PROMIS Smoking Initiative has developed an assessment toolkit for measuring 6 domains of interest to cigarette smoking research: nicotine dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and sensory expectancies, health expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social motivations for smoking. The papers in this supplement describe the methods used to develop these item banks, their psychometric properties, and the preliminary evidence for their validity. This commentary is meant to provide background information for the material in this supplement. METHODS: After discussing the use of item response theory in behavioral measurement, I will briefly review the initial developmental steps for the smoking assessment toolkit. Finally, I will describe the contents of this supplement and provide some closing remarks. RESULTS: Psychometric evidence strongly supports the utility of the toolkit of item banks, short forms (SFs), and computer adaptive tests (CATs). The item banks for daily smokers produce scores with reliability estimates above 0.90 for a wide range of each cigarette smoking domain continuum, and SF and CAT administrations also achieve high reliability (generally greater than 0.85) using very few items (4-7 items for most banks). Performance of the banks for nondaily smokers is similar. Preliminary evidence supports the concurrent and the discriminant validity of the bank domains. CONCLUSIONS: The new smoking assessment toolkit has attractive measurement features that are likely to benefit smoking research as researchers begin to utilize this resource. Information about the toolkit and access to the assessments is available at the project Web site (http://www.rand.org/health/projects/promis-smoking-initiative.html) and can also be accessed via the PROMIS Assessment Center (www.assessmentcenter.net).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of symptom intensity, mood, and comorbidities on patient-clinician agreement and the consistency of responses to functional patient-reported outcomes (PROs). DESIGN: Two data sources were used. The first, a cross-sectional database of patients with breast cancer who completed functional PROs and were administered the FIM, was used to examine whether average pain intensity (as measured with an 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) and Rand Mental Health inventory scores differed among those rating their functional independence as different than clinicians. The second, a longitudinal database of 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer who completed the Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM PAC CAT) with differences between their expected and actual responses as reflected in their AM PAC CAT SEs. SETTING: Two tertiary medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Data source #1, 163 women with stage IV breast cancer; data source #2, 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data source #1, FIM, pain NRS, Older Americans Resource Study activities of daily living subscale, Physical Function-10, Mental Health Inventory-17. Data source #2, AM PAC CAT and NRS symptom ratings. RESULTS: Pain intensity was significantly higher when clinicians and patients disagreed regarding a patient's independence in the ability to transfer (NRS pain severity, 3.78 vs 2.40; P=.014), groom (3.71 vs 2.36, P=.009), bathe (3.76 vs 2.40, P=.016), and dress (3.09 vs 2.44, P=.034). The magnitude of AM PAC CAT SEs was significantly associated with the severity of participants' pain, dyspnea, and fatigue, as well as the presence of musculoskeletal disorders and coronary artery disease. Neither mood nor emotional distress was associated with clinician-patient agreement or AM PAC CAT SE. CONCLUSIONS: Pain intensity is associated with disagreement between patients and clinicians about the patient's level of functioning. Moreover, physical symptoms (pain, dyspnea, fatigue) as well as specific medical comorbidities (musculoskeletal disorders, coronary artery disease), but not mood, are associated with inconsistency in patients' assessment of their functional abilities.

AB  - The American College of Surgeons (ACoS) Commission on Cancer (CoC) has advanced a new patient-centered accreditation standard requiring programs to implement psychosocial distress screening and referral for psychosocial care. The field of psychosocial oncology has advocated for routine distress screening as an integral component of quality cancer care since the NCCN Distress Management Panel first recommended this practice in 1999. Accreditation standards have a significant impact on practice patterns and quality of care. The new ACoS CoC Psychosocial Distress Screening Standard provides a unique opportunity to integrate the science of psychosocial care into clinical practice. National organizations, including the American Psychosocial Oncology Society, the Association of Oncology Social Work, the Cancer Support Community, and LIVESTRONG, can offer valuable guidance and resources. This article reviews ACoS CoC requirements, highlighting key research findings and providing practical considerations to guide programs with implementation. Although screening for distress encompasses many domains, this article reviews the evidence linking depression-one aspect of distress-and cancer outcomes to highlight the profound influence psychosocial care delivery can have on promoting medical outcomes and quality cancer survivorship. The authors describe distress screening program accomplishments at Northwestern University, including the electronic administration of NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive testing item banks. Electronic medical record integration facilitates real-time scoring, interpretation, provider notification, and triage for psychosocial care. Roughly one-third of patients have requested assistance with psychosocial needs. As ACoS CoC programs implement psychosocial distress screening and management, the emerging field of implementation science can guide future clinical program developments and research priorities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a prototype dyspnea computer adaptive test (CAT). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Two outpatient medical facilities. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of adults (N=292) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We developed a modified and expanded item bank and CAT for the Dyspnea Management Questionnaire (DMQ), an outcome measure consisting of 4 dyspnea dimensions: dyspnea intensity, dyspnea anxiety, activity avoidance, and activity self-efficacy. RESULTS: Factor analyses supported a 4-dimensional model underlying the 71 DMQ items. The DMQ item bank achieved acceptable Rasch model fit statistics, good measurement breadth with minimal floor and ceiling effects, and evidence of high internal consistency reliability (alpha=.92-.98). With the use of CAT simulation analyses, the DMQ-CAT showed high measurement accuracy compared with the total item pool (r=.83-.97, P<.0001) and evidence of good to excellent concurrent validity (r=-.61 to -.80, P<.0001). All DMQ-CAT domains showed evidence for known-groups validity (P</=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The DMQ-CAT reliably and validly captured 4 distinct dyspnea domains. Multidimensional dyspnea assessment in COPD is needed to better measure the effectiveness of pharmacologic, pulmonary rehabilitation, and psychosocial interventions in not only alleviating the somatic sensation of dyspnea but also reducing dysfunctional emotions, cognitions, and behaviors associated with dyspnea, especially for anxious patients.

AB  - People with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy are likely to experience enhanced social and emotional strain. Critically, those with both vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and psychosocial problems may have significantly reduced levels of functioning compared with psychologically healthy counterparts. This can cause inadequate compliance, increased strain on family functioning, worse diabetes control, increased progression of diabetic retinopathy and, consequently, further psychosocial stress resulting in a number of concerning implications for disease management, clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. However, the emotional and social health consequences of diabetic retinopathy have not yet been systematically explored. This information is crucial as it allows for a targeted approach to treatment and prevention and avoidance of the potentially detrimental implications described above. Therefore, this paper reviews the current qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and identifies directions for future research. Key search terms were applied to the electronic databases Pubmed, ISI Web of Science and Embase and the bibliographies of relevant papers were systematically reviewed for additional references. Overall, the evidence suggests that diabetic retinopathy and associated vision loss have several debilitating effects, including disruption of family functioning, relationships and roles; increased social isolation and dependence; and deterioration of work prospects resulting in increased financial strain. Adverse emotional responses include fear, anxiety, vulnerability, guilt, loss of confidence, anger, stress and self-perception issues. However, the research to date is largely qualitative in nature, with most quantitative studies being small, cross-sectional and somewhat outdated. Similarly, the outcome measures used in many studies to date are suboptimal in terms of content and validity. Therefore, this review identifies the need for improved outcome measures to provide valid, meaningful measurement of the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and discusses potential directions for future research such as item banking and computer adaptive testing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to develop a functional outcome instrument for hip and knee osteoarthritis research (OA-FUNCTION-CAT) using item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive test (CAT) methods and to assess its psychometric performance compared to the current standard in the field. METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature review, focus groups, and cognitive testing to guide the construction of an item bank consisting of 125 functional activities commonly affected by hip and knee osteoarthritis. We recruited a convenience sample of 328 adults with confirmed hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Subjects reported their degree of functional difficulty and functional pain in performing each activity in the item bank and completed the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to assess scale uni-dimensionality, and IRT methods were used to calibrate the items and examine the fit of the data. We assessed the performance of OA-FUNCTION-CATs of different lengths relative to the full item bank and WOMAC using CAT simulation analyses. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed distinct functional difficulty and functional pain domains. Descriptive statistics for scores from 5-, 10-, and 15-item CATs were similar to those for the full item bank. The 10-item OA-FUNCTION-CAT scales demonstrated a high degree of accuracy compared with the item bank (r = 0.96 and 0.89, respectively). Compared to the WOMAC, both scales covered a broader score range and demonstrated a higher degree of precision at the ceiling and reliability across the range of scores. CONCLUSIONS: The OA-FUNCTION-CAT provided superior reliability throughout the score range and improved breadth and precision at the ceiling compared with the WOMAC. Further research is needed to assess whether these improvements carry over into superior ability to measure change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methods based on item response theory (IRT) that can be used to examine differential item functioning (DIF) are illustrated. An IRT-based approach to the detection of DIF was applied to physical function and general distress item sets. DIF was examined with respect to gender, age and race. The method used for DIF detection was the item response theory log-likelihood ratio (IRTLR) approach. DIF magnitude was measured using the differences in the expected item scores, expressed as the unsigned probability differences, and calculated using the non-compensatory DIF index (NCDIF). Finally, impact was assessed using expected scale scores, expressed as group differences in the total test (measure) response functions. METHODS: The example for the illustration of the methods came from a study of 1,714 patients with cancer or HIV/AIDS. The measure contained 23 items measuring physical functioning ability and 15 items addressing general distress, scored in the positive direction. RESULTS: The substantive findings were of relatively small magnitude DIF. In total, six items showed relatively larger magnitude (expected item score differences greater than the cutoff) of DIF with respect to physical function across the three comparisons: "trouble with a long walk" (race), "vigorous activities" (race, age), "bending, kneeling stooping" (age), "lifting or carrying groceries" (race), "limited in hobbies, leisure" (age), "lack of energy" (race). None of the general distress items evidenced high magnitude DIF; although "worrying about dying" showed some DIF with respect to both age and race, after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that many physical function items showed DIF with respect to age, even after adjustment for multiple comparisons, indicates that the instrument may be performing differently for these groups. While the magnitude and impact of DIF at the item and scale level was minimal, caution should be exercised in the use of subsets of these items, as might occur with selection for clinical decisions or computerized adaptive testing. The issues of selection of anchor items, and of criteria for DIF detection, including the integration of significance and magnitude measures remain as issues requiring investigation. Further research is needed regarding the criteria and guidelines appropriate for DIF detection in the context of health-related items.

AB  - In designing a comparative clinical trial, the required sample size is a function of the effect size, the value of which is unknown and at best may be estimated from historical data. Insufficiency in sample size as a result of overestimating the effect size can be destructive to the success of the clinical trial. Sample size re-estimation may need to be properly considered as a part of clinical trial planning. This paper is intended to give the motivations for the sample size re-estimation based partly on the effect size observed at an interim analysis and for a resulting simple adaptive test strategy. The performance of this adaptive design strategy is assessed by comparing it with a fixed maximum sample size design that is properly adjusted in anticipation of the possible sample size adjustment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Item response theory (IRT) is a powerful framework for analyzing multiitem scales and is central to the implementation of computerized adaptive testing. OBJECTIVES: To explain the use of IRT to examine measurement properties and to apply IRT to a questionnaire for measuring migraine impact--the Migraine Specific Questionnaire (MSQ). METHODS: Data from three clinical studies that employed the MSQ-version 1 were analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis for categorical data and by IRT modeling. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses showed very high correlations between the factors hypothesized by the original test constructions. Further, high item loadings on one common factor suggest that migraine impact may be adequately assessed by only one score. IRT analyses of the MSQ were feasible and provided several suggestions as to how to improve the items and in particular the response choices. Out of 15 items, 13 showed adequate fit to the IRT model. In general, IRT scores were strongly associated with the scores proposed by the original test developers and with the total item sum score. Analysis of response consistency showed that more than 90% of the patients answered consistently according to a unidimensional IRT model. For the remaining patients, scores on the dimension of emotional function were less strongly related to the overall IRT scores that mainly reflected role limitations. Such response patterns can be detected easily using response consistency indices. Analysis of test precision across score levels revealed that the MSQ was most precise at one standard deviation worse than the mean impact level for migraine patients that are not in treatment. Thus, gains in test precision can be achieved by developing items aimed at less severe levels of migraine impact. CONCLUSIONS: IRT proved useful for analyzing the MSQ. The approach warrants further testing in a more comprehensive item pool for headache impact that would enable computerized adaptive testing.
