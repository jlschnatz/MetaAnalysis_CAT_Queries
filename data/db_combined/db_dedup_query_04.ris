AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance. Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables. This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance. The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

AB  - Stress becomes a significantly serious issue among university students and we need efficient tools to understand it more. The aim of present study is to develop a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to measure the mentioned stress, as pioneer project in Vietnam. In this vein, an item bank of 68 items has been constructed, which is based on Likert Polytomous Scales through five subdomains: behavior, academic performance, family, lecturer and finance. The sampling of the survey is large. It has assessed 2,085 students (704 males and 1,381 females). Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) Model is applied to develop Multidimensional Stress Scales and Computerized Adaptive Testing procedure. The result findings indicate that Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) can be used to develop new scale with psychometric properties. Indicated by various fit criteria MNSQ, standard errors, Z (t-test) implemented in software ConQuest. The subdomain has a good reliability (from .857 to .798). As respect to CATs, a simulated experiment based on the empirical data is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed computerized adaptive testing. The standard error of the estimated stress proficiencies are reported in this study. The 68 items stress data appropriate fit the Multidimensional model applied.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - The cognitive, emotional and motivational inhibition of highly gifted underachievers has become recently a topic of interest for researchers in clinical psychology and psychopathology. In this context the authors wanted to test whether a computerized adaptive test in mathematics could help unblocking the achievement motivation of those students. The main features and principles of construction of the test are described. The results of an exploratory study which was undertaken with 123 students belonging to the second class of a secondary school, 35 of which were highly gifted, stretches the interest of the integration of a CAT into the global treatment procedures of the motivational deficit of highly gifted underachievers.

AB  - Many cutting-edge computer and electronic products are powered by advanced Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Advanced SoCs encompass superb performance together with large number of functions. This is achieved by efficient integration of huge number of transistors. Such very large scale integration is enabled by a core-based design paradigm as well as deep-submicron and 3D-stacked-IC technologies. These technologies are susceptible to reliability and testing complications caused by thermal issues. Three crucial thermal issues related to temperature variations, temperature gradients, and temperature cycling are addressed in this thesis. Existing test scheduling techniques rely on temperature simulations to generate schedules that meet thermal constraints such as overheating prevention. The difference between the simulated temperatures and the actual temperatures is called temperature error. This error, for past technologies, is negligible. However, advanced SoCs experience large errors due to large process variations. Such large errors have costly consequences, such as overheating, and must be taken care of. This thesis presents an adaptive approach to generate test schedules that handle such temperature errors. Advanced SoCs manufactured as 3D stacked ICs experience large temperature gradients. Temperature gradients accelerate certain early-life defect mechanisms. These mechanisms can be artificially accelerated using gradient-based, burn-in like, operations so that the defects are detected before shipping. Moreover, temperature gradients exacerbate some delay-related defects. In order to detect such defects, testing must be performed when appropriate temperature-gradients are enforced. A schedule-based technique that enforces the temperature-gradients for burn-in like operations is proposed in this thesis. This technique is further developed to support testing for delay-related defects while appropriate gradients are enforced. The last thermal issue addressed by this thesis is related to temperature cycling. Temperature cycling test procedures are usually applied to safety-critical applications to detect cycling-related early-life failures. Such failures affect advanced SoCs, particularly through-silicon-via structures in 3D-stacked-ICs. An efficient schedule-based cycling-test technique that combines cycling acceleration with testing is proposed in this thesis. The proposed technique fits into existing 3D testing procedures and does not require temperature chambers. Therefore, the overall cycling acceleration and testing cost can be drastically reduced. All the proposed techniques have been implemented and evaluated with extensive experiments based on ITC<e2><80><99>02 benchmarks as well as a number of 3D stacked ICs. Experiments show that the proposed techniques work effectively and reduce the costs, in particular the costs related to addressing thermal issues and early-life failures. We have also developed a fast temperature simulation technique based on a closed-form solution for the temperature equations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed simulation technique reduces the schedule generation time by more than half.

AB  - In a post hoc simulation study (N = 3,597 psychiatric outpatients), we investigated whether the efficiency of the 90-item Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) could be improved for assessing clinical subjects with computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A CAT simulation was performed on each of the 3 MASQ subscales (Positive Affect, Negative Affect, and Somatic Anxiety). With the CAT simulation<e2><80><99>s stopping rule set at a high level of measurement precision, the results showed that patients<e2><80><99> test administration can be shortened substantially; the mean decrease in items used for the subscales ranged from 56% up to 74%. Furthermore, the predictive utility of the CAT simulations was sufficient for all MASQ scales. The findings reveal that developing a MASQ CAT for clinical subjects is useful as it leads to more efficient measurement without compromising the reliability of the test outcomes.

AB  - Item parameter drift (IPD) is the systematic differentiation of parameter values of items over time due to various reasons. If it occurs in computer adaptive tests (CAT), it causes errors in the estimation of item and ability parameters. Identification of the underlying conditions of this situation in CAT is important for estimating item and ability parameters with minimum error. This study examines the measurement precision of IPD and its impacts on the test information function (TIF) in CAT administrations. This simulation study compares sample size (1000, 5000), IPD size (0.00 logit, 0.50 logit, 0.75 logit, 1.00 logit), percentage of items containing IPD (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%), three time points and item bank size (200, 500, 1000) conditions. To examine the impacts of the conditions on ability estimations; measurement precision, and TIF values were calculated, and factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent samples was carried out to examine whether there were any differences between estimations in terms of these factors. The study found that an increase in the number of measurements using item bank with IPD items results in a decrease in measurement precision and the amount of information the test provides. Factorial ANOVA for independent samples revealed that measurements precision and TIF differences are mostly statistically significant. Although all IPD conditions negatively affect measurement precision and TIF, it has been shown that sample size and item bank size generally do not have an increasing or decreasing effect on these factors. ; Item parameter drift (IPD) is the systematic differentiation of parameter values of items over time due to various reasons.

AB  - PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important patient-reported outcome in clinical and health research. The EQ-5D-Y assesses child and adolescent HRQoL by five items on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) on the current health state. This study investigates predictors of self-reported HRQoL according to the EQ-5D-Y in chronically ill children and adolescents using longitudinal data. METHODS: Data from the German Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes, and juvenile arthritis gathered over a period of six months were analyzed (n = 310; 7-17 years old; 48% female). Self-, parent-, and pediatrician-reported data were collected from June 2013 to October 2014. Generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models served to examine effects of socio-demographic as well as disease- and health-specific predictors on the items as well as on the VAS of the EQ-5D-Y. RESULTS: Ceiling effects for the EQ-5D-Y indicated low burden of disease in the analyzed sample. Longitudinal analyses revealed associations between less health complaints and better HRQoL for all investigated HRQoL domains. Further, age- and gender-specific effects, and associations of better disease control, longer duration of the disease and less mental health problems with better HRQoL were found. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective health complaints and mental health problems should be considered in the care of children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes, and juvenile arthritis. Future research should suggest administering the items of the EQ-5D-Y with five instead of three response options, and investigate HRQoL over a longer period.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Musical Emotion Discrimination Task (MEDT) is a short, non-adaptive test of the ability to discriminate emotions in music. Test-takers hear two performances of the same melody, both played by the same performer but each trying to communicate a different basic emotion, and are asked to determine which one is 'happier', for example. The goal of the current study was to construct a new version of the MEDT using a larger set of shorter, more diverse music clips and an adaptive framework to expand the ability range for which the test can deliver measurements. The first study analysed responses from a large sample of participants (N = 624) to determine how musical features contributed to item difficulty, which resulted in a quantitative model of musical emotion discrimination ability rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT). This model informed the construction of the adaptive MEDT. A second study contributed preliminary evidence for the validity and reliability of the adaptive MEDT, and demonstrated that the new version of the test is suitable for a wider range of abilities. This paper therefore presents the first adaptive musical emotion discrimination test, a new resource for investigating emotion processing which is freely available for research use.

KW  - Universal screening ; Computer adaptive tests
AB  - Background: Universal screening is a critical component within a multi-tiered system of supports because it is the first mechanism by which students are identified as at-risk for failure. Screeners must have adequate psychometric properties to accurately identify students at-risk, however many measures result in moderate accuracy, indicating the presence of false negatives and false positives. These errors may affect the allocation of resources in schools, sometimes causing resources to be utilized unnecessarily and other times withholding services when they are needed. Purpose: This study examined the validity and diagnostic accuracy of a reading CAT using single time points and slopes within year, and longitudinally across one and two years. Methods: Screening and state test data were analyzed for students in third through fifth grade (N = 1696). Validity statistics were calculated using single time points and slopes on the CAT. Diagnostic accuracy analyses included the use of ROC curves to identify the CAT cut score associated with maximized sensitivity and specificity, and the cut score at the 25th and 40th percentile. Results: Correlation results for single screener points and the state test ranged from .60 to .79 (p = .0001). Correlation between slopes and the state test were weak for third and fourth grade (.21 and .14, respectively, p = .0001) and not significant for fifth grade. When ROC curves were used to identify the cut score associated with maximized sensitivity and specificity, overall accuracy was high for single points and moderate for slopes. Accuracy remained high for the cut score at the 25th and 40th percentile, though sensitivity levels were lower for the 25th percentile. Slopes yielded inadequate levels of sensitivity. Conclusion: Results suggest CATs may address issues of inadequate levels of diagnostic accuracy found in the screening literature but additional research is needed in samples with different base rates. ; Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, Department of

AB  - Abstract Background The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core30 (QLQC30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQC30. Methods According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases IIII are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included predefined item selection steps and a multistage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. Results On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. Discussion The phases IIII of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to largerscale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.  2013 The Authors.

AB  - In the present work the psychometric properties of an emotional adjustment computerized adaptive test are described. An examination of Item Response Theory (IRT) research literature indicates that IRT mainly has been used for assessing achievements and ability rather than personality factors. Nevertheless several studies in recent years have shown successful use of IRT with personality assessment instruments. Even so, a few works have inquired about the computerized adaptative test (CAT) features, based on IRT, for the measurement of a personality traits as emotional adjustment. Our results show CAT's efficiency for the assessment of emotional adjustment, so this provides a valid and accurate measurement and uses a smaller number of items in comparison with the emotional adjustment scales from the most strongly established questionnaires.

AB  - Compressor fouling is one of the main causes of gas turbine performance degradation. Microsized particles adhere to the blade surfaces increasing the surface roughness and modifying the airfoil shape. In the present work, the contamination of the Allison 250 C18 multistage compressor engine with four sorts of micrometric dust has been provided. The tests were performed changing the relative humidity at the compressor inlet and the unit rotational speed. After each test, a photographic inspection of the internal fouled parts has been realized and the digital pictures have been analyzed employing an image processing package. The deposits build-up of stator vanes and rotor blades have been post-processed and the most affected regions of each compressor stage have been highlighted. Besides, a numerical simulation of the machine has been performed. The numerical flow field has been used to highlight the blade regions which show the most favorable conditions for particle deposition. A theoretical model has been applied to the flow field to simulate the particle deposition. The combination of the deposition model with the results of the CFD simulations gives the chance to better understand the experimentally-founded deposition patterns. Those results have been finally compared to the pictures of the patterns. The possibility to detect and measure the deposition patterns on a rotating test rig and the comparison with models and experiments gave the possibility to assess in detail the particle deposition phenomenon on a multistage axial compressor flow path.

AB  - This study employed a quantitative research design to examine teacher assessment literacy and its relationship to external and internal factors. The researcher sought to describe the level of assessment literacy that teachers demonstrate when using score report data from computer-adaptive interim assessment and to analyze whether teachers<e2><80><99> assessment literacy seems to be affected by: a) the quality of professional development training received; b) teachers<e2><80><99> level of self-efficacy; c) teachers<e2><80><99> attribution to student effort, that is their perception of the importance of student effort; and d) teachers<e2><80><99> attribution to context, specifically their perception of the importance of tests. For this study, a relevant measurement instrument, the Assessment Literacy Skills for Computer Adaptive Tests (ALS-CAT), was designed to provide valid and reliable inferences about assessment literacy skills related to computer-adaptive tests. In addition to the ALS-CAT, the sample of 88 teachers responded to the Multidimensional Multiattributional Causality Scale (MMCS), the Data-Driven Decision-Making Efficacy Anxiety (3DMEA) inventory, and questions quantifying their perception of the quality of professional development experienced. Descriptive and explanatory correlational statistical analysis found no statistically significant relationships between respondents' scores on assessment literacy and respondents' scores on the perceived quality of professional development, perceived self-efficacy, attribution to student effort, or attribution to context. Additional analysis found a relationship between the perceived quality of professional development and perceived self-efficacy.

AB  - Gas turbine particle ingestion may lead to the deposition of contaminants in the compressor section, inducing the performance losses of the whole engine. The economic losses derived from this issue push great interest in the investigation of such a phenomenon from a numerical and experimental standpoint. This paper describes a quantitative approach to predict particle deposition on the vanes of an axial compressor starting from the flow field obtained employing CFD simulations. The results are then compared to the experiments performed on the Allison 250 C18 compressor unit subject to particle ingestion under controlled conditions. The results derived from the experimental and numerical investigations are presented, providing insight into the mass deposited on the vanes and the corresponding zones most affected by the particle deposition issue. The numerical model showed good agreement in the estimation of the predicted values of the deposited mass and the corresponding patterns through the compressor stages. The low-complexity approach proposed here, helps the designer to predict the contamination of the stationary rows starting from a simple set of single-phase numerical results. Furthermore, with the implementation of this approach into the design path, the designer could reduce the impact of fouling, looking at the effects of their solutions under the foulingreduction light.

AB  - Objective: To develop and evaluate a computer adaptive test for the assessment of anxiety in cardiovascular rehabilitation patients (ACAT-cardio) that tailors an optimal test for each patient and enables precise and time-effective measurement. Design: Simulation study, validation study (against the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the physical component summary scale of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey), and longitudinal study (beginning and end of rehabilitation). Setting: Cardiac rehabilitation centers. Participants: Cardiovascular rehabilitation patients: simulation study sample (nZ106; mean age, 57.8y; 25.5% women) and validation and longitudinal study sample (nZ138; mean age, 58.6 and 57.9y, respectively; 16.7% and 12.1% women, respectively). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and ACAT-cardio. Results: The mean number of items was 9.2 with an average processing time of 1:13 minutes when an SE .50 was used as a stopping rule; with an SE .32, there were 28 items and a processing time of 3:47 minutes. Validity could be confirmed via correlations between .68 and .81 concerning convergent validity (ACAT-cardio vs Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale) and correlations between .47 and .30 concerning discriminant validity (ACAT-cardio vs 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical component summary scale). Sensitivity to change was moderate to high with standardized response means between .45 and .82. Conclusions: The ACAT-cardio shows good psychometric properties and provides the opportunity for an innovative and time-effective assessment of anxiety in cardiovascular rehabilitation. A more flexible stopping rule might further improve the ACAT-cardio. Additionally, testing in other cardiovascular populations would increase generalizability.

AB  - The original publication is available at www.springerlink.com Copyright Springer [Full text of this article is not available in the UHRA] ; In a computer-adaptive test (CAT), learners are not usually allowed to revise previously entered responses. In this paper, we present findings from our most recent empirical study, which involved two groups of learners and a modified version of a CAT application that provided the facility to revise previously entered responses. Findings from this study showed that the ability to modify previously entered responses did not lead to significant differences in performance for one group of learners (p>0.05), and only relatively small yet significant differences for the other (p<0.01). The implications and the reasons for the difference between the groups are explored in this paper. Despite the small effect of the modification, it is argued that this option is likely to lead to a reduction in student anxiety and an increase in student confidence in this assessment method. ; Peer reviewed

AB  - To efficiently obtain information about both the general abilities and detailed cognitive profiles of examinees from a single model that uses a single-calibration process, higher-order cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) that employ higher-order cognitive diagnostic models have been developed. However, the current item selection methods used in higher-order CD-CAT adaptively select items according to only the attribute profiles, which might lead to low precision regarding general abilities; hence, an appropriate method was proposed for this CAT system in this study. Under the framework of the higher-order models, the responses were affected by attribute profiles, which were governed by general abilities. It is reasonable to hold that the item responses were affected by a combination of general abilities and attribute profiles. Based on the logic of Shannon entropy and the generalized deterministic, inputs, noisy 'and' gate (G-DINA) model discrimination index (GDI), two new item selection methods were proposed for higher-order CD-CAT by considering the above combination in this study. The simulation results demonstrated that the new methods achieved more accurate estimations of both general abilities and cognitive profiles than the existing methods and maintained distinct advantages in terms of item pool usage.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The most frequently used measures of facial emotion recognition (FER) are insufficiently comprehensive, reliable, valid, and efficient; moreover, the impact of gender on scoring has not been controlled. OBJECTIVE: To develop a computerized adaptive test of FER for adults with schizophrenia. DESIGN: First, we selected photographs from a published database. Second, items that fitted well to a Rasch model were used to form the item bank. Third and last, we determined the best administration mode for prospective users to achieve both high reliability and efficiency. SETTING: Psychiatric hospitals and the community. PARTICIPANTS: Adults living with schizophrenia (n = 351) and adults without diagnosed mental illness (n = 101). RESULTS: After removal of misfit items (infit or outfit >/=1.4), the remaining 165 items were selected to form an item bank. Among them, 39 showed severe gender bias, so the item difficulties were adjusted accordingly. On the basis of the item bank, two administration modes were recommended for prospective users. The reliable mode required approximately 128 items (nearly 20 min) to achieve reliability (.72-.81), similar to that of the entire item bank. The efficient mode required approximately 73 items (approximate 11 min) to provide acceptable reliability (.69-.73) for the seven domain scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our newly developed measure provides comprehensive, valid, and unbiased (to examinees' gender) assessments of FER in adults living with schizophrenia. In addition, the administration modes can be flexibly changed to optimize the reliability or efficiency for prospective users. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: This newly developed FER measure can help occupational therapists identify deficits in recognizing specific basic emotions and plan corresponding interventions to manage the impact on their clients' social functions.

AB  - Simpler and more precise tools are needed to measure Taijin Kyofusho which is a culture-bound anxiety disorder in East Asian countries. This study aimed to develop and validate a short form and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) of Taijin Kyofusho Scale (TKS), as well as compare the measurement precision of the short form, the CAT version and its original version. Item Response Theory (IRT) method was used to develop static short form and to simulate CAT. The short form consisted of 12 items (a 61% reduction) and the CAT version consisted of average 11.72 items (a 62% reduction) from the original TKS, respectively. Both short form and CAT version have similar levels of accuracy and precision in comparison to the original scale at the group level. However, at the individual level, the CAT version can maintain a more consistent level of precision across the continuum of severity than the short form. The short form of the TKS is sufficient for an initial assessment or screening in the community population. And the CAT version of the TKS is more suitable for tailored treatments in the clinical practice, which could detect detailed changes in the severity of Taijin Kyofusho.

AB  - We evaluated construct validity, responsiveness, and utility of change indicators of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS adult v1.0 item banks for Depression and Anxiety administered as computerized adaptive test (CAT). Specifically, the CATs were compared to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) using pre- and re-test data of adult patients treated for common mental disorders (N = 400; median pre-to-re-test interval = 215 days). Construct validity was evaluated with Pearson<e2><80><99>s correlations and Cohen<e2><80><99>s ds; responsiveness with Pearson<e2><80><99>s correlations and pre-post effect sizes (ES); utility of change indicators with kappa coefficients and percentages of (dis)agreement. The results showed that the PROMIS CATs measure similar constructs as matching BSI scales. Under the assumption of measuring similar constructs, the CAT and BSI Depression scales were similarly responsive. For the Anxiety scales, we found a higher responsiveness for CAT (ES = 0.64) compared to the BSI (ES = 0.50). Finally, both CATs categorized the change scores of more patients as changed compared to matching BSI scales, indicating that the PROMIS CATs may be more able to detect actual change than the BSI. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement over matching BSI scales as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients. We discuss several additional differences between the PROMIS CATs and the BSI to help test users choose instruments. These differences include the adopted measurement theory (Item Response Theory vs. Classical Test Theory), the mode of administration (CAT vs. fixed items), and the area of application (universal vs. predominantly clinical). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) This study suggests that PROMIS CATs for Depression and Anxiety measure the same constructs as matching BSI subscales in Dutch adult patients treated for common mental disorders, are at least as able to detect change over time, and categorize the change scores of more patients as actually changed. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students<e2><80><99> test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students<e2><80><99> test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Educational Impact and Implications Statement<e2><80><94>With the growth in computer-based educational assessment, there are new opportunities to tailor testing to the characteristics and needs of students. Computer-adaptive testing is one such opportunity. Computer-adaptive testing presents items or sets of items (e.g., testlets) in a way to match different students<e2><80><99> abilities. Based on a large-scale numeracy assessment exercise in Australia, our study showed that computer-adaptive testing assessed achievement accurately, had positive effects for key parts of students<e2><80><99> test motivation and engagement, and benefited adolescent students who are at an age when they are typically less motivated and engaged. Computer-adaptive testing may therefore be a means to promote more positive experiences for students as they participate in computer-based and online educational testing.

AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Current interest in measuring quality of life is generating interest in the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) with Likert-type items. Calibration of an item bank for use in CAT requires collecting responses to a large number of candidate items. However, the number is usually too large to administer to each subject in the calibration sample. The concurrent anchor-item design solves this problem by splitting the items into separate subtests, with some common items across subtests; then administering each subtest to a different sample; and finally running estimation algorithms once on the aggregated data array, from which a substantial number of responses are then missing. Although the use of anchor-item designs is widespread, the consequences of several configuration decisions on the accuracy of parameter estimates have never been studied in the polytomous case. The present study addresses this question by simulation, comparing the outcomes of several alternatives on the configuration of the anchor-item design. The factors defining variants of the anchor-item design are (a) subtest size, (b) balance of common and unique items per subtest, (c) characteristics of the common items, and (d) criteria for the distribution of unique items across subtests. The results of this study indicate that maximizing accuracy in item parameter recovery requires subtests of the largest possible number of items and the smallest possible number of common items; the characteristics of the common items and the criterion for distribution of unique items do not affect accuracy. (Contains 1 table, 10 figures, and 1 note.)

AB  - The effects of providing immediate knowledge of results (KR) and adaptive testing on test anxiety and test-taking motivation were investigated. Also studied was the accuracy of student perceptions of the difficulty of adaptive and conventional tests administered with or without immediate knowledge of results. Testees were 350 college students divided into high- and low-ability groups and randomly assigned to one of four test strategies by KR conditions. The ability level of examinees was found to be related to their reported levels of motivation and to differences in reported motivation under the different testing conditions. These results suggest that adaptive testing creates a psychological environment for testing which is more equivalently motivating for examinees of all ability levels and results in a greater standardization of the test-taking environment, than does conventional testing.

AB  - Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) make it possible to estimate the ability of each student during the testing process. The computer presents items to students at the appropriate level, and students take different versions of the same test. Computerized testing increases the flexibility of test management in that: (1) tests are given on demand and scores are immediately available; (2) differences among administrators cannot affect scores and trained administrators are not needed; (3) tests can be individually paced; and (4) test security is increased. Computerized testing also offers options for timing and formatting, increases efficiency, and can provide accurate scores over a wide range of abilities. Some limitations to CATs are considered. CATs are not appropriate for some subjects and skills. Hardware limitations restrict the types of items that can be administered by computer, and many schools simply do not have the resources to administer CATs. A relatively large sample is needed to norm test items; comparable scores depend heavily on the quality of the estimates of item characteristics because each student answers a different set of items. The military has been among the pioneers in using CATs and at least two public school systems have begun to use them. A list of six organizations involved in computerized adaptive testing is included. (SLD)

AB  - A new testing strategy that provides protection against the problem of having examinees in adaptive testing choose difficulty levels that are not matched to their proficiency levels was introduced and evaluated. The method, termed restricted self-adapted testing (RSAT), still provides examinees with a degree of control over the difficulty levels of their test items. The range of item choice is restricted to a region around the examinee's current proficiency estimate. Participants in this study were 186 students in grades 3 through 8 in the Portland (Oregon) Public School system during the winter of 1992-93, who were tested as part of an ongoing computerized adaptive testing program. Students were randomly assigned to a computerized adaptive test (CAT), a self-adaptive test (SADT), or RSAT in mathematics. Results indicate no differences between CAT and SADT conditions in terms of mean proficiency and mean posttest state anxiety. The basic RSAT method appears to hold promise for providing examinees with control over the testing situation, while preventing large mismatches between item difficulty choice and proficiency level. The RSAT procedure should be evaluated empirically. (SLD)

AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - Large-scale testing programs are generally based on the assumptions that the test-takers experience standard conditions for taking the test and that everyone will do his or her own work without having prior knowledge of specific questions. These assumptions are not necessarily true. The ways students and educators use to get around standardizing conditions to gain an advantage are described, and ways to reduce these behaviors are presented. In the first place, there is traditional cheating, by copying, or describing answers, which is enhanced by electronic gadgets or international exchanges of information. Lax security can result in the theft of test booklets. Teachers and other educators can undermine the validity of test by ignoring evidence of student preknowledge of the test or by tacitly colluding with students by allowing access to test materials. The measurement community needs to do a better job of educating educators about the importance of standard conditions. Testing agencies or programs should audit some testing sites to determine the existence of standard conditions, and new techniques of test administration, including computer adaptive tests, must be developed to improve test security.

AB  - In this paper, under the framework of SQL information sequence mining, combined with well-known social anxiety scales at home and abroad, a social anxiety question bank and its computerized adaptive test (CAT-SA) are constructed. The IRT analysis includes: unidimensionality test, item model-data fitting test, local independence test, DIF test, and selecting items that meet the IRT requirements to construct a social anxiety question bank and its CAT. According to the two-stage adaptive assessment with similar significance in the evaluation scene design, the ITC_SoPI scale was used to evaluate the individual's degree of adaptation and subjective feeling to the virtual environment. VR-based social anxiety assessment can provide more detailed and comprehensive assessment information and data, and the assessment results are doser to the self-assessment scale and the individual's daily life and state.

AB  - Adaptive testing is a generic term for a number of techniques which aim at improving the test quality and/or reducing the test application costs. In adaptive tests, the test content or pass/fail limits are not fixed as in conventional tests, but dependent on other test results of the currently or previously tested chips. Part-average testing, outlier detection, and neighborhood screening are just a few examples of adaptive testing. With this Embedded Tutorial, we are offering an introduction to this topic, which is hot in the test community, to the wider DATE audience.

AB  - Random testing (RT) and subdomain testing are two major software testing strategies. Their simplicity makes them likely the most efficient testing strategies with respect to the time required for test case selection. However, the disadvantage of RT is its defect detection effectiveness. Adaptive testing (AT) is a feedback-based software testing strategy that has been shown to be more effective than RT and partition testing (PT). However, a major concern in the application of AT is its complexity and computational cost for test case selection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that uses AT and random partition testing (RPT) in an alternating manner. The motivation for this approach is that both strategies are employed such that the underlying computational complexity of AT is reduced by introducing RPT into the testing process without affecting the defect detection effectiveness. A case study with seven real-life subject programs is presented. The experimental results demonstrate that this novel strategy considerably reduces the computational overhead of the original AT strategy but still outperforms the pure RT strategy and PT strategy in terms of the number of test cases used to detect and remove a given number of defects. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the robustness of our strategy.

AB  - The transonic wind tunnel TWG of DLR Gottingen has been modernized with respect to an improved flow quality as well as to the logistics of exchangeable test sections, operational reliability and productivity. It is presently equipped with a Laval nozzle (supersonic), a perforated test section (transonic) and a two-dimensional adaptive (subsonic) test section. The latter can perform 2D adaptive tests on wing profiles using the Cauchy integral formula for wall adaptation, as well as 2D wall adaptation for 3D models utilizing the Wedemeyer/Lamarche (VKI) procedure. For both cases the wall adaptation was successful. The 3D force results compare quite well nominally interference-free results and to results from another adaptive test section. The pressure distribution from the wing profile tests agree quite well with theoretical results. For the 3D model, residual wall interferences were determined. It was found that the wall interferences had been reduced to nearly zero on the centreline of the test section by wall adaptation. Spanwise averages of the residual wall interferences have been used for further corrections.

AB  - Studies in gamified e-learning tools lack on clarifying whether Gamification improves the user engagement and therefore the learning experience, or if the success depends on the system itself, independently of the Gamification process. As an attempt to start answering these questions, we present an existing adaptive self-evaluation tool where we have observed low engagement issues by analysing students' behaviour when using it during our previous experiences. Gamification can face those issues while maintain the system essence on dynamic adaptability. With the inclusion of Gamification mechanics in our existing environment, we will be able to measure if Gamification works, or if the system performance keeps as in the not-gamified version.

AB  - The advantages of creating multimedia item types and applying computer-based adaptive testing in education are: First, the capability to motivate learning by making the learners feel more engaged and interactive, as well as a better representation of concepts, which are not possible when using conventional multiple choice tests. Second, instead of following a curriculum designed for average students, an individual is given a customized curriculum suitable for his or her learning capability. However, the issue to address when achieving these goals is the enormous amount of item types required to transform the current multiple choice questions into multimedia formats, and the criteria used to determine the difficulty level of a multimedia question item. In this paper we propose a multimedia item shell design that not only reduces the number of item types required, but also computes difficulty level of an item automatically. The concept of question seed is also introduced to make content creation more cost-effective.

AB  - Manufacturing defects in nanoscale technologies have highly complex timing behaviour that is also affected by process variations. While conventional wisdom suggests that it is optimal to detect a delay defect through the longest sensitisable path, non-trivial defect behaviour along with modelling inaccuracies necessitate consideration of paths of well-controlled length during test generation. We present a generic methodology that yields tests through all sensitisable paths of user-specified length. The resulting tests can be employed within the framework of adaptive testing. The methodology is based on encoding the problem as a Boolean-satisfiability (SAT) instance and thereby leverages recent advances in SAT-solving technology.

AB  - The adoption of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) instead of classical testing (FIT) raises questions from both teachers' and students' perspectives. The scientific literature shows that teachers using CAT instead of FIT should experience shorter times to complete the assessment and obtain more precise evaluations. As for the students, adaptive testing seems to increase their engagement, whereas the impossibility to revise the already given questions is usually seen as a detrimental characteristic. In such a context, the paper reports on a study concerning the aforementioned points. The outcomes seem almost all inline with the literature: no particular usability issues were detected, CAT is faster than FIT, and CAT does not seem more engaging than FIT. All these findings are reported in the conclusions as a list of suggestions to teachers interested in switching from FIT to CAT.

The total of 56 students majoring in Educational Technology from Shandong Normal University participated in this study, and their RI cognitive styles were diagnosed using the Matching Familiar Figures Test-20 (MFFT-20). Examinees' ability values and average item response time were recorded by the computerized adaptive testing system. Then mediation analysis was implemented and the findings revealed that there was direct and indirect effect between RI cognitive style and item response time in CAT. What is more, RI cognitive style also directly affected the ability levels, and then the ability levels impacted on item response time. So, examinee's ability level was partly a mediator between RI cognitive style and item response time. Furthermore, RI cognitive style of the examinees might also be diagnosed according to ability values and average item response time. The relevant research and implications were further discussed.

AB  - In recent years, the multistage adaptive test (MST) has gained increasing popularity in the field of educational measurement and operational testing. MST refers to a test in which pre-constructed sets of items are administered adaptively and are scored as a unit (Hendrickson, 2007). As a special case of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), a MST program needs the following components: an item response theory (IRT) model or non-IRT-based alternatives; an item pool design; module assembly; ability estimation; routing algorithm; and scoring (Yan et al., 2014). A significant amount of research has been conducted on components like module assembly, ability estimation, routing and scoring, but few studies have addressed the component of item pool design. An item pool is defined as consisting of a maximal number of combinations of items that meet all content specifications for a test and provide sufficient item information for estimation at a series of ability levels (van der Linden et al., 2006). An item pool design is very important because any successful MST assembly is inseparable from an optimal item pool that provides sufficient and high-quality items (Luecht & Nungester, 1998). Reckase (2003, 2010) developed the p-optimality method to design optimal item pools using the unidimensional Rasch model in CAT, and it has been proved to be efficient for different item types and IRT models. The present study extended this method to MST context in supporting and developing different MST panel designs under different test configurations. The study compared the performance of the MST assembled under the most popularly studied panel designs in the literature, such as 1-2, 1-3, 1-2-2, and 1-2-3. A combination of short, medium and long tests with different routing test proportions were used to build up different tests. Using one of the most popularly investigated IRT models, the Rasch model, simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 optimal items pools were generated and the measurement accuracy was evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. The p-optimality method was also applied in an operational MST licensure test to see if it is feasible in supporting test assembly and achieving sufficient measurement accuracy in practice. Results showed that the different MST panel designs achieved sufficient measurement accuracy by using the items from the optimal item pools built with the p-optimality method. The same was true with the operational item pool. Measurement accuracy was related to test length, but not so much to the routing test proportions. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but the distributions of the item parameters and item pool characteristics for all the MST panel designs were similar under the two conditions. The item pool sizes under the exposure control conditions were several times larger than those under no exposure control, depending on the types of MST panel designs and routing test proportions. The results from this study provide information for how to enhance item pool utilization when designing multistage computerized adaptive tests, facilitating the MST assembly process, and improving the scoring accuracy.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the dimensionality of the Neuroticism scale of the Basic Traits Inventory in order to contribute to the larger project of developing computer adaptive testing for the five scales of the Basic Traits Inventory. The Neuroticism scale comprises the general factor of Neuroticism and four group factors or facets, namely, Affective Instability, Depression, Self-Consciousness, and Anxiety (Taylor & De Bruin, 2006; Taylor & De Bruin, 2013).Personality constructs and scales are complex as they typically comprise heterogeneous items for reliability and validity purposes (Reise, Morizot, & Hays, 2007). It is therefore to be expected that some studies present evidence of a scale that measures an overarching single dimension <e2><80><93> unidimensionality <e2><80><93> whilst other studies find evidence of multiple dimensions <e2><80><93> multidimensionality (Gibbons et al., 2007; Immekus & Imbrie, 2008; Reise, Moore, & Haviland, 2010). Consequently, specification of a strictly unidimensional model is often not realistic for complex personality constructs and scales. However, test-developers and researchers aspire to unidimensionality (Zinbarg, Yovel, Revelle, & McDonald, 2006) as unidimensionality allows for the unambiguous interpretation of scale scores (Reise et al., 2010), is considered a precondition to reliability and validity, encourages the use of a total score (Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma, 2003), meets the unidimensional assumption of item response theory models, and is the prerequisite for the development of computer adaptive testing (Thomas, 1990; Weiss & Gibbons, 2007).Against this background, the key question that was posed in this study was not whether the Neuroticism scale was strictly unidimensional or not, but rather if the scale was unidimensional enough to allow for the meaningful interpretation of a total score (Morizot, Ainsworth, & Reise, 2009). This study focussed on attaining evidence of the presence of a strong general factor which would justify the interpretation of a total score and for applying unidimensional item response theory models to the scale (Reise, 2012).The Basic Traits Inventory was completed by 1 966 participants from various industries and organisations within South Africa. Statistical analyses were performed on the responses to the Neuroticism scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to investigate the unidimensionality and strength of the general factor of the scale, while evaluating the influence of multidimensionality on the interpretation of the general factor or the total score. This dimensionality investigation of the scale was achieved by comparing three confirmatory factor models using the goodness-of-fit indices and the standardised factor loadings of the models. The competing structural models were: a one-factor or unidimensional model which represented the general factor and interpretation of a total score for the scale; a four-factor or multidimensional model which represented the multiple factors of the scale and therefore the interpretation of the group factors or facets; and a bifactor model which allowed for the examination of the strength of the general factor in comparison to that of the group factors of the scale.The results of this study confirmed that the Neuroticism scale is multidimensional as the scale comprises multiple group factors or facets. However, the findings of the study revealed the strong presence of a general factor that runs through all the items of the scale, and consequently suggest that efforts to make use of and interpret separate subscale scores lack the needed empirical evidence to do so. In essence, the findings of the study demonstrated that the presence of unidimensionality in the scale is prominent despite the multidimensionality of the scale, which confirmed that the interpretation of the total score for the scale is justified and preferred irrespective of the multidimensionality of the scale.Overall, the findings and evidence of this study proposed that the Neuroticism scale is unidimensional enough to meet the unidimensional assumption of item response theory models. Accordingly, these results support the advancement of adapting the Neuroticism scale of the Basic Traits Inventory for computer adaptive testing (Reise, 2012; Thomas, 1990; Weiss & Gibbons, 2007).This study further confirmed that when developing a multifaceted scale, it is essential to analyse the dimensionality of the scale in order to determine what the scale is actually measuring. The bi factor model can be employed in the development, exploration and confirmation of the dimensionality of the scale to examine the strength of the general factor relative to the multiple group factors of the scale.

AB  - Four item selection methods are compared and investigated under three test formats in the context of Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing (MCAT) delivering polytomous items partially or completely in tests. Item selection methods examined include Fisher information based D-optimality (D-optimality), Kullback-Leibler information index (KI), mutual information (MI), and continuous entropy method (CEM). The three test formats considered are the POLYTYPE format that contains polytomous items with three response categories, the DPMIX format that delivers dichotomous items at the beginning and polytomous items at the final stage, and the PDMIX format that has the reverse order as DPMIX. In general, D-optimality shows the best estimation accuracy and conditional estimation accuracy. D-optimality, MI, and CEM are similar in terms of ability estimation accuracy and tendency in selecting items when the item bank size is large. For both dichotomous and polytomous items, KI is mostly outperformed by the other three methods in terms of ability estimation precision. When sub-thetas in both dimensions are equal, however, KI shows the best performance for polytomous items. In this study, which item type, dichotomous or polytomous, being administered first does not affect the estimation accuracy. However, if the test length is much longer or shorter than the test length of the current study, it is possible that the estimation accuracy could be affected by the order of delivering different item types. Both DPMIX and PDMIX formats yield similar conditional estimation accuracy pattern and precision. In addition, the item bank size does affect the estimation precision. These conclusions, however, might not be applied to MCAT testing with different test designs or item pool structures. More studies are needed in MCAT combining with polytomous items to further facilitate the development and improvement of the next-generation assessments such as formative assessment or testing for diagnosis.

AB  - The popularity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is increasing rapidly. In order to make learning environments more efficient, researchers have been exploring the possibility of an automatic adaptation of the learning environment to the learner or the context. One of the possible adaptation techniques is adaptive item sequencing by matching the difficulty of the items to the learner's knowledge level. This is already accomplished to a certain extent in adaptive testing environments, where the test is tailored to the person's ability level by means of the item response theory (IRT). Even though IRT has been a prevalent computerized adaptive test (CAT) approach for decades and applying IRT in item-based ITSs could lead to similar advantages as in CAT (e.g. higher motivation and more efficient learning), research on the application of IRT in such learning environments is highly restricted or absent. The purpose of this paper was to explore the feasibility of applying IRT in adaptive item-based ITSs. Therefore, we discussed the two main challenges associated with IRT application in such learning environments: the challenge of the data set and the challenge of the algorithm. We concluded that applying IRT seems to be a viable solution for adaptive item selection in item-based ITSs provided that some modifications are implemented. Further research should shed more light on the adequacy of the proposed solutions. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - This article discusses the growing interest in computer-adaptive testing, which supporters say can help guide instruction, increase student motivation, and determine the best use of resources for districts. This method of testing shortens the test by not asking high-achieving students questions that are too easy for them, and likewise not giving struggling students questions that are too hard. However, computer-adaptive assessments are not the best way to evaluate students in every situation, experts point out. Though, they recognize the potential of computer-adaptive testing, experts also voice caution in using this kind of method.

In particular, there is presently no easy way for students to make use of the SDView satellite imagery in learning elementary geography. An image map viewer could be useful for K-12 students to understand the relationship between image data and geographic information. A web-based intelligent tutoring system has been used in many educational systems as an efficient way to deliver educational material. In an intelligent tutoring system, an adaptive testing scheme can be employed to accurately evaluate a student's knowledge level by utilizing a test. Therefore, we focus on developing a web-based intelligent tutoring system for elementary geography students using an adaptive testing scheme. In this thesis, a prototype system, called SD-ITS, has been developed for a web-based geographic learning system. The prototype system is focused on applying an adaptive testing scheme and making an interactive image map for the intelligent tutoring system. This thesis demonstrates that the prototype system, SD-ITS, controls the student's test progress and has the ability to provide appropriate level of tutoring information from SDView or other archives for the students. This system adaptively adjusts the geography testing for each student on the basis of his/her knowledge level. In addition, an interactive image map application provides tutoring information that helps the students comprehend the real geographic information. In this thesis, the prototype system aims to motivate elementary students to learn more geography information through adaptive testing and an interactive geography maps for tutoring purpose.

AB  - With the development and maturation of computer technology and test theories, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become more widely used in educational assessment. Most CATS systems are based on item response theory (IRT), and as compared with traditional paper and pencil tests (P & P test), CAT selects the most suitable items according to individual examinee's ability. Thus, it provides a more accurate and efficient estimate of examinees' ability. Along with the development of the society and the rising education for the general public, there is stronger demand that educational tests should not only be used to rank and screen examinees, but also to provide diagnostic information about students' misconceptions. Researchers have proposed different models to establish these diagnostic tests, through which we can estimate examinees' knowledge ability or psychological traits from their item responses. Among these models, the Rule Space Model (RSM) is an influential one and has been implemented in the analysis and reporting of the PSAT (Preliminary SAT Test) for high school leavers in the United States of America. Incorporating RSM into CAT will lead to a totally new testing system<e2><80><94>the diagnostic computerized adaptive test. However, we have little knowledge on the characteristics of the model in its ability estimation efficiency, its new item selection strategy, and stopping rule, among other things. The present research aimed to understand these characteristics. Broadly differentiated, there were two main research purposes. Firstly, the research aimed to understand in greater depth the properties of the RSM, including, such as, how estimation accuracy would be affected by different factors (e.g. test length). Secondly, in the incorporation of RSM in diagnostic computerized adaptive tests, the performances of four different item selection methods were compared. These two purposes were achieved through two related sets of studies. The first set of experiments consisted of seven simulation experiments to investigate factors affecting the performance of the RSM. These factors being examined include: test length, number of attributes in the test, hierarchical relations among attributes, nature (simple versus complicated) of items used, item guessing or slipness parameter, and item response model (one- versus three-parameter model) used in item bank. The second set of experiments compared four item selection strategies in diagnostic CAT, with random selection method as borderline method. In order to calculate and compare the accuracy of examinees' attribute estimation, the Monte Carlo simulation method was used in both sets of studies. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - The advantages that computer adaptive testing offers over linear tests have been well documented. The Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) design is more efficient than the Linear test design as fewer items are needed to estimate an examinee's proficiency to a desired level of precision. In the ideal situation, a CAT will result in examinees answering different number of items according to the stopping rule employed. Unfortunately, the realities of testing conditions have necessitated the imposition of time and minimum test length limits on CATs. Such constraints might place a burden on the CAT test taker resulting in aberrant response behaviors by some examinees. Occurrence of such response patterns results in inaccurate estimation of examinee proficiency levels. This study examined the effects of test lengths, time limits and the interaction of these factors with the examinee proficiency levels on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns. The focus of the study was on the aberrant behaviors caused by rushed guessing due to restrictive time limits. Four different testing scenarios were examined; fixed length performance tests with and without content constraints, fixed length mastery tests and variable length mastery tests without content constraints. For each of these testing scenarios, the effect of two test lengths, five different timing conditions and the interaction between these factors with three ability levels on ability estimation were examined. For fixed and variable length mastery tests, decision accuracy was also looked at in addition to the estimation accuracy. Several indices were used to evaluate the estimation and decision accuracy for different testing conditions. The results showed that changing time limits had a significant impact on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns conditional on ability. Increasing test length had negligible if not negative effect on ability estimation when rushed guessing occured. In case of performance testing high ability examinees while in classification testing middle ability examinees suffered the most. The decision accuracy was considerably affected in case of variable length classification tests.

AB  - The benefits of adaptive testing, reduced test length and increased measurement precision, are in part achieved through the application of a maximum-information item selection algorithm. While such an algorithm is an effective means for tailoring the difficulty of adaptive tests to examinee ability, its use with multidimensional content domains might result in examinations that lack content validity. Licensure and certification examinations typically assess knowledge of multidimensional content domains. As such, balancing test content is an important consideration for these types of tests. This study investigated the effects of content balancing on an adaptive licensure and certification examination. A computer simulation was used with data distributions attained from previous administrations of a conventional test. The performance of the adaptive test was examined under four content-balancing methods and fifteen stopping rules. The results showed that employing a rigorous content-balancing method had no significant adverse effect on the efficiency or accuracy of the adaptive test under study. Findings, also indicated that ability estimation bias contributed to slight inaccuracies in the determination of the passing status for examinees whose abilities were near the minimum passing ability. The findings of this study support the use of adaptive testing for licensure and certification examinations under the following conditions: rigorous content balancing is employed, the item bank contains a sufficient number of items to optimally measure a range of abilities, and if estimation bias is found to affect the pass/fail decision, it is corrected. Implications of these findings are discussed for school certification testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study was designed to help educators evaluate the desirability of computer adaptive testing compared to nonadaptive paper/pencil testing for middle school students and teachers. Computer adaptive testing uses computers for test administration, selection of items, scoring, and reporting. The study examined three aspects of computer adaptive testing: (1) student attitudes concerning computer testing; (2) student factors (e.g., gender) affecting student attitudes; and (3) teacher perceptions about its strengths and weaknesses. The study examined the relationships between student factors (gender, race/ethnicity, math ability level, math test performance, grade, and computer usage) and student attitudes concerning computer adaptive testing. Three aspects of student attitudes were examined: ease with the method, comfort with equipment, and preference for computer adaptive testing. The sample consisted of 343 students and 6 teachers from one middle school in a mid-Atlantic school district. The students took two versions of a functional mathematics test--paper/pencil and computer adaptive--and a 14 item survey assessing their attitudes about the test. The teachers participated in a survey and interview. The results of the study indicate that a majority of the students and teachers support computer adaptive testing. With regards to students, a majority reported positive reactions in areas such as preference for computer testing as opposed to paper/pencil testing, clarity of directions and graphics, and ease of reading from the screen. However, a majority of students also reported that they were bothered by their inability to review and change answers. In addition, accelerated and remedial ability level students were more concerned with some aspects of computer adaptive testing than average ability level students. Differential results for the factors of gender and math achievement were also found. With regards to teachers, positive comments focused on the shorter time needed for testing, convenience of using computer technology for testing, and immediate scoring information. Although the study shows strong student and teacher support for the use of this new testing methodology, several important issues should be addressed especially for remedial and accelerated ability level students.

AB  - Optimal test design involves the application of an item selection heuristic to construct a test to fit the target information function in order that the standard error of the test can be controlled at different regions of the ability continuum. The real data simulation study assessed the efficiency of binary programming in optimal item selection by comparing the degree in which the obtained test information was approximated to different target information functions with a manual heuristic. The effects of imposing a content balancing constraint was studied in conventional, two-stage and adaptive tests designed using the automated procedure. Results showed that the automated procedure improved upon the manual procedure significantly when a uniform target information function was used. However, when a peaked target information function was used, the improvement over the manual procedure was marginal. Both procedures were affected by the distribution of the item parameters in the item pool. The degree in which the examinee empirical scores were recovered was lower when a content balancing constraint was imposed in the conventional test designs. The effect of uneven item parameter distribution in the item pool was shown by the poorer recovery of the empirical scores at the higher regions of the ability continuum. Two-stage tests were shown to limit the effects of content balancing. Content balanced adaptive tests using optimal item selection was shown to be efficient in empirical score recovery, especially in maintaining equiprecision in measurement over a wide ability range despite the imposition of content balancing constraint in the test design. The study had implications for implementing automated test designs in the school systems supported by hardware and expertise in measurement theory and addresses the issue of content balancing using optimal test designs within an adaptive testing framework.

AB  - The strategies examinees employ when making item difficulty level choices in self-adapted computerized testing were investigated. Subjects were 148 college students (88 females and 60 males) in an introductory statistics course. The primary instrument was a self-adapted computerized algebra test used to measure student readiness for the statistics course. Each examinee was administered 20 items from a pool of 93. Students rated their self-efficacy before the test and were administered measures of mathematics anxiety and test anxiety. Inspection of each student's data file provided an indicator of selection strategy. Examinees who chose a more difficult first test item expressed greater capability and higher confidence, reported less anxiety just prior to testing, and less anxiety about mathematics in general. When selecting additional items, examinees tended toward what was termed a sluggishly flexible strategy; they chose more difficult items after passing an item or string of items, and chose less difficult items after failing a single item or string of items. The most frequent choice was to remain at the same level. Results indicate that self-adaptive testing may be a viable alternative to computerized adaptive testing. Two figures and two tables contain data from the study. (SLD)

AB  - A nominal response model-based computerized adaptive testing procedure (nominal CAT) was implemented using simulated data. Ability estimates from the nominal CAT were compared to those from a CAT based upon the three-parameter logistic model (3PL CAT). Furthermore, estimates from both CAT procedures were compared with the known true abilities used to generate the simulated data. Results showed that the nominal CAT's ability estimates were highly correlated with those of the 3PL CAT as well as with the true abilities. Furthermore, the nominal CAT had a significantly higher association with negative true thetas than did the 3PL CAT, and it also had significantly lower standard errors of estimate than did the 3PL CAT. However, the nominal model-based CAT had difficulty estimating positive thetas and had a poor convergence rate. In contrast, the 3PL CAT had a high convergence rate and its performance was not affected by whether the true abilities were positive or negative. Potential reasons for the nominal CAT's high nonconvergence rate as well as implications for computerized adaptive testing were discussed. (Author)

AB  - Computer adaptive testing systems are feasible for certification and licensure testing. This is in part due to the availability of extensive yet inexpensive computers. Modern item response theory, combined with computerized adaptive testing, yields a powerful new method of testing which provides greater accuracy and efficiency and less boredom for the examinee. The computer presents each item, scores it, and then selects the next item which is appropriate for the individual examinee; thus, individual testing is much more feasible than it would be using human examiners. There are additional advantages: acceptable accuracy can be achieved with fewer items; more accurate estimates can be obtained at the extreme ends of the ability continuum; test security is improved; tests can be administered on demand when needed; and a greater variety of item types may be included. With licensing and certification tests, it is important to obtain a good pool of test items, to be accurate near the minimum cutting score, to have appropriate unidimensionality, and to use computers in a comfortable environment. It is also useful to have a large number of examinees, approximately 1000 or more. Cost estimates are encouraging, especially when the computer systems are used often. (GDC)

AB  - A situation in which computer-assisted instruction was combined with teacher-taught classes and computerized diagnostic adaptive testing was examined. The computerized diagnostic adaptive test for pre-algebra signed-number lessons was programmed along with a computer-managed routing system by which examinees were sent to the instructional unit corresponding to the skill level at which they stopped in the initial test. Upon completing the course a computerized conventional post test was administered. It was found that results differed markedly from results obtained in a previous study. A cluster analysis was performed on the response patterns of the skills, and four different groups were found. A discriminant analysis indicated significant differences among the four groups in response patterns of the skills in signed number operations. It was determined that differences between prior and current instructional methods confused students and caused confusion in the post-test data, and that the scoring procedure of the adaptive testing was not sensitive to individual differences in information processing skills which were affected by the instructional method used in previous teaching. It was concluded that reliance should not be placed solely on test results determined by performance scores on a diagnostic pretest. (Author/CTM)

AB  - BackgroundPatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be useful for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts (BLTC) to evaluate the impact of treatment and/or guide shared decision making. Yet, a set of PROMs relevant to patients with BLTC is currently unavailable. In this study, we selected a PROMs set for patients with BLTC.MethodsPotentially relevant patient reported outcomes (PROs) were selected by psychologist-researchers based on keywords used or suggested by participants of two virtual focus groups meetings consisting of thirteen female BLTC patients with a median age of 50<c2><a0>years. Subsequently, patients were asked to report their most relevant PROs. PROMs identified by systematic literature review and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) were considered in selecting the final PROMs set to assess relevant outcomes.ResultsThe most important PROs were: insecurity/anxiety (11/12 patients), pain (9/12 patients), fatigue (8/12 patients), and limitations in daily life (5/12 patients). The literature review included 23 studies, which used various generic and disease-specific PROMs, often not measuring (all) relevant PROs. The final selected PROMs set included numerical rating scales for pain, two questions on overall health and quality of life and four PROMIS CATs.ConclusionsA PROMs set generically and efficiently measuring outcomes relevant for patients with BLTC was developed and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

AB  - A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL<c2><a9>) to assess quality of life of children born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance in Dutch children. After Swedish<e2><80><93>Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old children, 8/17 items had >5% missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual child<e2><80><99>s situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in different countries are needed.

AB  - In recent decades, computerized multistage testing (MST) has been utilized as an alternative testing mode for large-scale testing programs. Although the usage of MST has been discussed extensively, there is little literature that addresses its psychometric properties. The motivation of this dissertation arises from the need to properly estimate psychometric properties under the MST framework. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrated set of formulas for estimating psychometric properties for MST, including error variance, reliability, and classification indices. To achieve this goal, existing methods that are used for the traditional P\\&P tests are extended to the MST context, if possible; and new methods are proposed based on the characteristics of MST (i.e., routing probability) for the ML and EAP estimators. For the ML estimator, a conventional approach to computing MST test information analytically is also included for estimating the psychometric properties. The proposed approach and the conventional approach are then applied to a single set of MST data, with varied conditions. Further, a simulation approach is employed for the purpose of understanding and comparing the performance of the proposed approach and conventional approach. In the simulation approach, replications of test data are used to obtain results.The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) for the ML estimator, the proposed analytic approach performed better than the conventional approach, indicated by comparing their results with those from the simulation approach; (2) for the EAP estimator, results from using the Bayesian approach approach led to smaller values of marginal error variances and higher values of reliability, compared with the quadrature approach; (3) longer test resulted in decreased error variances and improved reliability; (4) for the EAP Bayesian approach, increasing sample size had a limited impact on the estimation results; (5) for all the approaches, conditional classification consistency and accuracy gradually decreased when the ability parameter was moving further away from the cut scores. All of the estimation formulas provided in this dissertation can be applied directly to MST data in practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) results in significant physical, psycho-social and socioeconomic burden. Identifying efficient and reliable patient reported outcome measures is critical for research and clinical purposes. The NIH's Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments have not been compared to validated "legacy" instruments in older adults with cLBP. This study evaluates construct (convergent and discriminant) validity and time to complete (TTC) PROMIS as compared to legacy instruments. METHODS: We enrolled older Veterans (age 60+) with cLBP with/without leg pain scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Subjects completed PROMIS computer adaptive test item banks and corresponding legacy instruments in the following domains: pain intensity, interference, and behavior; functional status; depression and anxiety; fatigue; sleep and social functioning. Convergent and discriminant validity between PROMIS and legacy instruments was evaluated using Spearman rank order correlations; Mann-Whitney U tests compared TTC. RESULTS: Of the 71 Veterans recruited, the median (IQR) age was 67 (63-71) years old, 94% were men, 76% were White, 17% Black, and 96% were Non-Hispanic. Spearman correlations between PROMIS and legacy instruments showed moderate to very strong convergent validity in all domains (r = 0.4-1.0), except for social functioning and pain behavior (PROMIS Pain Behavior with Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire). The total median TTC for all PROMIS items was significantly shorter than legacy items, 8 min 50 s vs 29 min 14 s respectively, p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Given time efficiency of using PROMIS, along with strong construct validity, PROMIS instruments are a practical choice for measuring multidimensional PROs in older Veterans with cLBP for both research and clinical purposes.

AB  - Incorporating off-grade items within an on-grade item pool is often seen in K-12 testing programs. Incorporating off-grade items may provide improvements in measurement precision, test length, and content blueprint fulfillment, especially for high- and low-performing examinees, but it may also identify some concerns when using too many off-grade items on tests that are primarily designed to measure grade-level standards. This dissertation investigates how practical constraints such as the number of on-grade items, the proportion, and range of off-grade items, and the stopping rules affect item pool characteristics and item pool performance in adaptive testing.This study includes simulation conditions with four study factors: (1) three on-grade pool sizes (150, 300, and 500 items), (2) three proportions of off-grade items in the item pool (small, moderate, and large), (3) two ranges of off-grade items (one grade level and two grade levels), and (4) two stopping rules (variable- and fixed-length stopping rule) with two SE threshold levels. All the results are averaged across 200 replications for each simulation condition.The item pool characteristics are summarized using descriptive statistics and histograms of item difficulty (the b-parameters), descriptive statistics and plots of test information functions (TIFs), and the standard errors of the ability estimate (SEEs). The item pool performance is evaluated based on the descriptive statistics of measurement precision, test length and exposure properties, content blueprint fulfillment, and mean proportion of off-grade items for each test.The results show that there are some situations in which incorporating off-grade items would be beneficial. For example, a testing organization with a small item pool attempting to improve item pool performance for high- and low-performing examinees. The results also show that practical constraints of incorporating off-grade items, organized here from most impact to least impact in item pool characteristics and item pool performance, are: 1) incorporating off-grade items into small baseline pool or large baseline pool; 2) broadening the range of off-grade items from one grade level to two grade levels; 3) increasing the proportion of off-grade items in the item pool; and 4) applying variable- or fixed-length CAT. The results indicated that broadening the range of off-grade items yields improvements in measurement precision and content blueprint fulfillment when compared to increasing the proportion of off-grade items. This study could serve as guidance for test organizations when considering the benefits and limitations of incorporating off-grade items into on-grade item pools.

AB  - High-stakes licensure or certification examinations are required for many health professions disciplines to ensure safe entry-level practice. Accrediting agencies set a benchmark for graduates<e2><80><99> first-time licensure or certification success as a measure of program effectiveness. Failures of graduates on licensure or certification examinations may directly affect the school<e2><80><99>s recruitment and retention of qualified students and faculty, as well as institutional financial viability. A health science university has added Health Education System, Inc. (HESI) standardized examinations using computer adaptive testing into the family nurse practitioner (FNP) master<e2><80><99>s program to support certification success, although research on these advanced practice examinations as related to certification outcomes was lacking. Guided by classical test theory, this study was an investigation of whether a relationship existed between students<e2><80><99> performance on 4 HESI standardized examinations (Advanced Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacotherapeutics, Advanced Health Assessment, and the APRN/FNP Exit exam) and first-time FNP certification success. Binary logistic regression analysis of data from 117 students who graduated between 2013<e2><80><93>2016 indicated that none of the 4 standardized HESI examinations significantly predicted FNP certification success, perhaps due to the examinations not carrying any evaluative weight within the program. The results of this project study may be used to promote positive social change by providing a means to improve first-time certification success and increasing the availability of primary care providers in the role of FNP.

AB  - Animal carcinogenicity experiments are conducted by private entities and government agencies to investigate whether a substance causes cancer. Since most tumors are occult and it is necessary to conduct a necropsy to detect the presence of cancer, producing unbiased tests for differences in tumor incidence is challenging. The highest doses given in these experiments often have toxic effects in the animals or might affect tumor lethality, and many common statistical methods for survival data perform poorly when such effects induce differences in mortality across treatment groups. The poly- k test, developed by Bailer & Portier (1988) as a modification of the Cochran-Armitage test, was designed to avoid problems from differential mortality, but is based on strong parametric assumptions, specifically that underlying tumor hazard may be modeled as Weibull with shape parameter k (usually set to 3). Existing literature that examines the performance of the poly-k and competitor tests assumes Weibull tumor hazards, and finds that the poly-k can be biased under treatment toxicity when its shape parameter assumption is not met. Given that this test has become a standard for government agencies such as the National Toxicology Program and the FDA, closer examination is warranted. Our simulations examine the performance of the poly-k under non-Weibull tumor hazards, and find that our own parametric tests can outperform it under these conditions. For tests like the poly-k, our goal is to develop and examine the performance of adaptive testing algorithms that estimate a test's parameter based on the data; one such estimation was suggested under Weibull assumptions by Moon et al. (2003), though their approach based on estimating lifetime cumulative tumor incidence rates does not make full use of the available data, and requires that the experiment include multiple interim sacrifices for adequate performance. Under most of our simulation settings, our k<cb><86> MLE test, based on estimating the shape parameter k by maximizing the full likelihood, has type I error and power very similar to the poly-k test with correctly-specified k, and it maintains size better, with comparable or higher power, than the test based on the Moon et al. estimate. Our MLE-based test does not require interim sacrifices, although it may perform better under some interim sacrifice experimental designs. We compare these tests under a variety of parametric assumptions and serial sacrifice designs to examine which experimental settings are most optimal for test performance.

AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context. The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24 p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature. Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N = 100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N = 101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool<e2><80><99>s usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This dissertation investigated the impact of item parameter drift (IPD) on examinee ability measures, in the analysis of data generated from a computerized adaptive test (CAT) collected in year 2003 by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in a Medical Technologist (MT) examination. For the 2003 ASCP MT exam, the item bank included 1,270 items. Items were selected from seven subscales: (a) blood banking, (b) chemistry, (c) hematology, (d) immunology, (e) laboratory operations, (f) microbiology, and (g) urinalysis. ASCP administered this CAT to 2,555 examinees. The data were analyzed using a new hierarchical linear model (HLM), called the Rasch longitudinal model (RLM), which models interaction between the item and time, in addition to parameters of examinee ability and item difficulty (easiness). The analysis demonstrated how IPD within the item bank for the ASCP MT exam affected examinee ability measures, and the extent to which IPD altered certification or pass-fail decisions. The RLM identified items that exhibited significant IPD for each subscale and provided the magnitude (and direction) of IPD within the 2003 ASCP MT exam data. No one subscale was more sensitive to IPD than any other. Further, by including significant time effects (IPD), the RLM provided a better fit to the data than the Rasch model as an HLM. The RLM not only determined items exhibiting IPD but also compensated for the existence of IPD within the calculation of examinee abilities by using the drifted item difficulty value versus the anchored one. Consequently, the RLM provided more accurate measures of examinee ability and item difficulty than the Rasch model as analyzed using the WINSTEPS program As a result, using the RLM yielded a more efficient IPD detection method, one that identified items with IPD but also corrected the estimation of examinee abilities for the existence of IPD.

AB  - Computer Adaptive Sequential Testing (CAST) is a test delivery model that combines features of the traditional conventional paper-and-pencil testing and item-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The basic structure of CAST is a panel composed of multiple testlets adaptively administered to examinees at different stages. Current applications of CAST reply on the item response theory (IRT) and assume a unidimensional IRT model for scoring. This study evaluated the robustness of CAST when tests were constructed, administered, and scored by a unidimensional IRT model but item responses were multidimensional. Various conditions of multidimensionality were simulated in item pools, as well as different levels of content misclassification through manipulation of the correspondence between content area and dimension of items. An automated test assembly (ATA) process constructed CAST panels from the item pools, each representing a unique combination of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Administration of the panels was simulated and multidimensional response data were scored by the unidimensional IRT model. The ability scores, routing decisions, and pass-fail decisions were evaluated against "true" ability scores and decisions to assess the impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Results showed that, when multidimensionality was mild as measured by the angle distance between item clusters, unidimensional ability estimates and routing decisions were not sensitive to the level of content misclassification in item pools. Only when multidimensionality was severe, panels without content misclassification yielded more accurate ability estimates and routing decisions. However, type I errors of pass-fail decisions (defined as passing unqualified examinees) were the smallest for panels without content misclassification, regardless of the severity of multidimensionality. The conclusion was that, although content classification, affecting dimensional structure during test assembly, might not be a serious concern for unidimensional ability estimation and routing decisions for CAST with multidimensional data, it played a significant role in the accuracy of pass-fail decisions.

AB  - The McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ - SF) is a measure of pain published in 1987. This dissertation conducts a confirmatory factor analysis of the measure's structure, as well as a calibration of the items on the measure, using Item Response Theory. A total of 1185 patients reporting to two chronic pain care treatment centers completed the MPQ - SF in the course of their admission to treatment. Factor analyses of their data suggests a three-factor solution of acute, emotional, and soreness factors led to a higher order factor of pain. This solution provides an adequate fit for the data. Previously published one and two factor structures did not demonstrate adequate fit in this data set. Unidimensionality in this sample was supported by the presence of a higher order factor of Pain. Items on the measure are calibrated using the two-parameter logistic model. Specifically, item slope and location parameters are calculated for each of the items, and differential item functioning is investigated between four subgroups of data. Performance on the items was contrasted between subgroups differing on gender, pain diagnosis, workers' compensation status and pain coping status using Raju's DFIT methodology. No differential test functioning was found; however, some individual items did display differential item functioning by subgroup. Sample characteristics that contribute to differential item functioning are examined further. Additionally, implications for diagnostic considerations and computer adaptive testing are discussed.

AB  - To satisfy the security requirements of computerized adaptive tests (CATs), efforts have been made to control the exposure rates of optimal items directly by incorporating statistical methods into the item selection procedure. Since differences are likely to occur between the exposure control parameter derivation stage and the operational CAT administrations, the exposure control methods may not fully accomplish the goal of controlling item exposure. This study explored the effects of the distribution changes on the performance of the Sympson and Hetter (SH) (J. Sympson and R. Hetter, 1985) and the Davey and Parshall (DP) (T. Davey and C. Parshall, 1995) procedures and provided an examination of the assertion that the Stocking and Lewis (M. Stocking and C. Lewis, 1998) conditional multinomial (SLC) procedure would function independently of an real examinee population. Simulations were carried out for this study using various combinations of the intended and real ability distributions. The results show that the changes in the examinees' ability distribution affected both SH and DP procedures in their control of the observed maximum exposure rates, and the effects were more profound for the SH method. The performance of the SLC method was demonstrated to be independent of the examinee's ability distributions in the operational CAT administrations. Contains 19 references, 5 tables, and 4 figures.

AB  - This study represented a first attempt to evaluate the impact of local item dependence (LID) for Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The most basic CAT design and a simplified design for simulating CAT item pools with varying degrees of LID were applied. A data generation method that allows the LID among items to be defined was applied to generate five CAT item pools. The LID exhibited by these pools ranged from zero LID (complete local item independence) to extreme LID. Results indicate that for certain types of scoring an extreme amount of LID may adversely impact the final score obtained by the examinee. The estimated precision of the test was also affected by the extreme LID level studied here. For the medium level of LID, structured to display the amount of LID typically displayed by the Law School Admission Test, the effects of the LID were not troublesome.

AB  - This study investigated and compared the properties of five methods of item exposure control within the purview of estimating examinees' abilities in a CAT context. Simulations were used to carry out this research. The item pools were constructed based on item parameters calibrated from the existing paper-and-pencil ACT Assessment Mathematics Test. Each of the exposure control algorithms was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed according to the CAT design established for this study. The merits and shortcomings of these strategies were considered under two item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of item security, test overlap rates, pool utilization, and the conditional standard errors of measurement, bias, and root mean squared errors. The general observations revealed that the randomization technique did not better ensure item security to any noticeable extent than the procedure without exposure control. The Sympson and Hetter and the Stocking and Lewis unconditional multinomial procedures produced very similar results under all conditions. However, when developing the exposure control parameters, the Sympson and Hetter method was much more efficient. The results yielded by the Davey and Parshall procedure were in general favorable. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates, but this came at the price of decreases in precision due to the strict control of item exposure. The performance of the various methods was affected differentially by the size of the item pool. Also, the comparative properties of the various methods were not consistent under the two desired exposure rate conditions. These differential effects might be attributed to the specific features of the algorithms in combination with the structure of the item pool. Each method had its advantages and disadvantages, but none possessed all desired characteristics. There was a clear and logical trade-off between exposure control and measurement precision. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure, and to a slightly lesser extent, the Davey and Parshall method seemed to be the most promising considering all factors this study addressed.

AB  - In the past several years many statistical indices have been developed that attempt to quantify the extent to which responses to questions on a test fit the underlying test model. This area of research is commonly referred to as person fit. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a test administration procedure in which questions are selected from a pool of available questions depending on how an examinee has responded to previous test questions. Thus, within the CAT environment each examinee is administered a tailored or dynamic test that is unique compared to other examinees' tests. Previous researchers have not investigated the issue of person fit within the context of CAT. The present study was a monte carlo investigation that simulated nonmodel-fitting responses within the CAT environment under a variety of conditions. The independent variables in this investigation were (1) the number of nonmodel-fitting responses, (2) the location of the nonmodel-fitting responses, (3) the point in the CAT process at which testing terminated, and (4) the entry point used for the CAT. The dependent variables were (1) the number of questions administered, (2) accuracy of the estimates of examinees' location on the latent trait ability continuum ($\theta$), (3) each examinee's fit to the underlying model using the $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices, and (4) the distribution of $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices within the CAT environment. It was found that when several nonmodel-fitting responses occurred early in the CAT procedure (i.e., warm-up effect) the recovery of $\theta$ was very poor. When a warm-up effect was simulated, not only did test length increase but also more examinees were identified as not fitting the model. Using a standard error of less than.20 to terminate the CAT resulted in estimated $\theta$ values that were biased and poorly estimated. Finally, the entry point used in the CAT administration did not seem to affect final ability estimates. Future research should consider developing new indices to quantify the extent to which examinees fit the test model within the CAT environment, and new methods of simulated nonmodel-fitting response patterns within CAT.

AB  - Educational technology has been a focus of development and research in science teaching and learning. This document reviews research dealing with computer and hypermedia applications to assessment in science education. The paper reports the findings first for computer applications for assessment and then for hypermedia applications in assessment. Computer applications include access to large test banks, evaluation of student data collected in laboratory exercises, microcomputer-administered diagnostic testing, effects of computer use on student motivation during computer-administered tests, and computerized adaptive testing. Hypermedia applications include interactive videodisc technology for teaching biology, assessing teachers' knowledge for certification purposes, problem-based learning in chemistry found in the "Hyperequation" project, and administering figural response test items to cell and molecular biology students. The summary describes three advantages for incorporating computer-assisted assessment: immediate student feedback, ease of test taking, and availability of another form of formative assessment. Users of computer-assisted assessment are cautioned that computer-generated tests can lull the teacher into simply testing low level recall knowledge, and that the linear nature of computer testing does not allow the student to go back and reflect upon particular items.

AB  - The loudness of quasi continuous impulse noise has been studied as a function of impulse duration and repetition rate, and the spectral shape and relative level of steady background noise. The measurements were performed on 1-second trains of white-noise bursts with exponentially decaying envelopes. The repetition rates were 5 to 100 Hz. The impulse durations were adjusted so that the duty factor of the impulse train (product of the repetition rate and the effective duration of the impulses) varied from 0.025 to 0.1. Steady white background noise was added at peak-to-background ratios of 10, 20 and 30 dB. The loudness levels of the stimuli relative to a steady white noise reference stimulus at a presentation level of 60.5 dB L$\sb{\rm eq}$ were measured in ten normal-hearing subjects using an adaptive testing procedure. Under most conditions, the loudness levels of the quasi continuous impulse noise stimuli were best predicted by the equivalent sound pressure level, L$\sb{\rm eq}$, indicating that the "equal energy" relation was followed. At the 50 and 100-Hz repetition rates, the loudness level of the impulse noise test stimuli at the 20 and 30-dB peak-to-background ratios exceeded that of the reference stimulus due to the "roughness effect". The loudness levels of the stimuli at the lower repetition rates, on the other hand, was significantly less than the equal energy prediction at the shortest durations, which suggests that auditory temporal integration depends on the duty factor of the impulse train. The data of experiment 1 were fit by a simple model involving the duty factor of the impulse train and the difference between the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the impulsive component and the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the steady background noise component of the test stimuli. In the second experiment, the spectral shape of the background noise did not significantly affect the point of subjective equality. However, there was a significant interaction between background noise spectrum and peak-to-background noise ratio which was suggestive of a masking process.

AB  - The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was evaluated for Item Response Theory (IRT) assumptions, local independence and parameter invariance in order to determine the feasibility of developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version. Three conditions were studied including two simulated CAT versions and a standard version (Form R). A sex difference was noted across all groups, but item order did not otherwise affect scores which were highly correlated with the IRT based scores. After excluding those items which did not fit the model, the local independence assumption generally held across groups, and since the procedure used to assess local independence was also sensitive to multidimensionality, this provides implied support for unidimensionality of the various scales. The procedures used to investigate item order effects and parameter invariance yielded mixed results. Overall, this study provides evidence favorable to a CAT adaptation of the MMPI, and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB  - The value of statistical research depends on valid comparisons which can usefully influence educational policy. Educational research needs to extend the measures of learning (such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress) through nationally-calibrated absolute measures and through computer-assisted and adaptive testing. Direct sampling by computer would make educational polls and national assessment faster and less expensive. A national bureau of educational standards might be founded to collect, coordinate, calibrate, archive, analyze, synthesize, and make available the data that is needed to improve educational productivity. Nine factors promoting efficiency and productivity of learning are classified in three broad categories: (1) student aptitude, including ability, development, and motivation; (2) instruction, including amount of time students engage in learning and quality of instructional experience; and (3) environmental factors, such as home climate, classroom social group, peer group, and television viewing. The tables in the appendix illustrate the effect of productivity factors on achievement revealed by quantitative syntheses carried out by a number of investigators in Australia, Canada and the United States during the past decade.

AB  - Recent developments in the dimensional assessment of personality functioning have made the implementation of latent measurement models increasingly attractive. In this study, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a well-established personality functioning instrument (the OPD Structure Questionnaire) to identify a unidimensional latent trait and to evaluate the feasibility of computer adaptive testing (CAT). We hypothesized that the use of IRT could reduce the test burden<e2><80><94>compared to a fixed short form<e2><80><94>while maintaining high precision over a wide range of the latent trait. The OPD-SQ was collected from 1235 patients in a psychosomatic clinic. IRT assumptions were fulfilled. A 9-factor model yielded sufficient fit and unidimensionality in exploratory factor analysis with bifactor rotation. Items were iteratively reduced, and a graded-response IRT model was fitted to the data. Simulations showed that a CAT with approximately 7 items was able to capture an OPD-SQ global severity score with an accuracy similar to that of a fixed 12-item short form. The final item bank and CAT yielded satisfactory content validity. Strong correlations with depression and anxiety replicated previous results on the OPD-SQ. We concluded that IRT applications could be useful to reduce the test burden of personality functioning instruments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test. Design: This is a psychometric study. Setting: The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany. Subjects: A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study. Interventions: Not applicable. Main measures: The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients. Results: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item<e2><80><93>trait interaction (<cf><87><c2><b2>(203) = 172.59; P = .94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits). Conclusion: The unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

AB  - Two-sample multiple testing has a wide range of applications. The conventional practice first reduces the original observations to a vector of p-values and then chooses a cutoff to adjust for multiplicity. However, this data reduction step could cause significant loss of information and thus lead to suboptimal testing procedures. In this thesis, I present a new framework for two-sample multiple testing by incorporating a carefully constructed auxiliary variable in inference to improve the power. A data-driven multiple testing procedure is developed by employing a covariate-assisted ranking and screening (CARS) approach that optimally combines the information from both the primary and auxiliary variables. The proposed CARS procedure is shown to be asymptotic valid and optimal for false discovery rate (FDR) control. The procedure is implemented in the R-package CARS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of CARS in FDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. CARS is also illustrated through an application to the analysis of satellite imaging data set for supernova detection. In addition to the aforementioned two-sample multiple testing problem, multistage designs have been used in a wide range of scientific fields as well. By allocating sensing resources adaptively, one can effectively eliminate null locations and localize signals with a smaller study budget. We formulate a decision-theoretic framework for simultaneous multistage adaptive testing and study how to minimize the total number of measurements while meeting pre-specified constraints on both the false positive rate (FPR) and missed discovery rate (MDR). The new procedure, which effectively pools information across individual tests using a simultaneous multistage adaptive ranking and thresholding (SMART) approach, can achieve precise error rates control and lead to great savings in total study costs. Numerical studies confirm the effectiveness of SMART for FPR and MDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. The SMART procedure is demonstrated through the analysis of high-throughput screening data and spatial imaging data. I also discuss ongoing and future research directions in this thesis, particularly on the topics of online FDR control and structured multiple testing. For applications, I discuss in detail on using online FDR control for real time anomaly detection for user engagement metrics at Snap Inc.

AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap initiative devoted to developing better measurement tools for assessing constructs relevant to the clinical investigation and treatment of all diseases-constructs such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, sleep, physical functioning, and social participation. Following creation of item banks for these constructs, our priority has been to validate them, most often in short-term observational studies. We report here on a three-month prospective observational study with depressed outpatients in the early stages of a new treatment episode (with assessments at intake, one-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up). The protocol was designed to compare the psychometric properties of the PROMIS depression item bank (administered as a computerized adaptive test, CAT) with two legacy self-report instruments: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999). PROMIS depression demonstrated strong convergent validity with the CESD and the PHQ-9 (with correlations in a range from .72 to .84 across all time points), as well as responsiveness to change when characterizing symptom severity in a clinical outpatient sample. Identification of patients as "recovered" varied across the measures, with the PHQ-9 being the most conservative. The use of calibrations based on models from item response theory (IRT) provides advantages for PROMIS depression both psychometrically (creating the possibility of adaptive testing, providing a broader effective range of measurement, and generating greater precision) and practically (these psychometric advantages can be achieved with fewer items-a median of 4 items administered by CAT-resulting in less patient burden).

AB  - IRT, also referred as modern test theory, offers many advantages over CTT-based methods in test development. Specifically, an IRT information function has the capability to build a test that has the desired precision of measurement for any defined proficiency scale when a sufficient number of test items are available. This feature is extremely useful when the information is used for decision making, for instance, whether an examinee attain certain mastery level. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is one of the many examples using IRT information functions in test construction. The purposes of this study were as follows: (1) to examine the consequences of improving the test quality through the addition of more discriminating items with different item formats; (2) to examine the effect of having a test where its difficulty does not align with the ability level of the intended population; (3) to investigate the change in decision consistency and decision accuracy; and (4) to understand changes in expected information when test quality is either improved or degraded, using both empirical and simulated data. Main findings from the study were as follows: (1) increasing the discriminating power of any types of items generally increased the level of information; however, sometimes it could bring adverse effect to the extreme ends of the ability continuum; (2) it was important to have more items that were targeted at the population of interest, otherwise, no matter how good the quality of the items may be, they were of less value in test development when they were not targeted to the distribution of candidate ability or at the cutscores; (3) decision consistency (DC), Kappa statistic, and decision accuracy (DA) increased with better quality items; (4) DC and Kappa were negatively affected when difficulty of the test did not match with the ability of the intended population; however, the effect was less severe if the test was easier than needed; (5) tests with more better quality items lowered false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rate at the cutscores; (6) when test difficulty did not match with the ability of the target examinees, in general, both FP and FN rates increased; (7) polytomous items tended to yield more information than dichotomously scored items, regardless of the discriminating parameter and difficulty of the item; and (8) the more score categories an item had, the more information it could provide. Findings from this thesis should help testing agencies and practitioners to have better understanding of the item parameters on item and test information functions. This understanding is crucial for the improvement of the item bank quality and ultimately on how to build better tests that could provide more accurate proficiency classifications. However, at the same time, item writers should be conscientious about the fact that the item information function is merely a statistical tool for building a good test, other criteria should also be considered, for example, content balancing and content validity.

AB  - Objective: Current health literacy measures are too long, imprecise, or have questionable equivalence of English and Spanish versions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and pilot testing of a new bilingual computer-based health literacy assessment tool. Methods: We analyzed literacy data from three large studies. Using a working definition of health literacy, we developed new prose, document and quantitative items in English and Spanish. Items were pilot tested on 97 English- and 134 Spanish-speaking participants to assess item difficulty. Results: Items covered topics relevant to primary care patients and providers. English- and Spanish-speaking participants understood the tasks involved in answering each type of question. The English Talking Touchscreen was easy to use and the English and Spanish items provided good coverage of the difficulty continuum. Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative results provided useful information on computer acceptability and initial item difficulty. After the items have been administered on the Talking Touchscreen (la Pantalla Parlanchina) to 600 English-speaking (and 600 Spanish-speaking) primary care patients, we will develop a computer adaptive test. Practice implications: This health literacy tool will enable clinicians and researchers to more precisely determine the level at which low health literacy adversely affects health and healthcare utilization.

AB  - There is a dearth of research involving advanced second language (L2) learners in the USA [Brantmeier, C., 2001. Second language reading research on passage content and gender: challenges for the intermediate level curriculum, Foreign Language Annals 34, 325-333; Young, D.J., 2003. Workshop on overcoming anxiety in the foreign language classroom. Language Learning Series, Washington University in St. Louis]. At some universities in the USA many freshmen test directly into the advanced levels of Spanish language instruction where the goal is to prepare students for the reading of lengthy, authentic texts. With 71 advanced L2 learners of Spanish, the current research project attempts to determine the reliability of self-assessment, as determined by a questionnaire previously utilized for placement [Birckbichler, D., Corl, K., Deville, C., 1993. The dynamics of language program testing: implications for articulation and program revision. The Dynamics of Language Program Direction. Heinle and Heinle, Boston, MA; Deville, M., Deville, C., 1999. Computer-adaptive testing in second language contexts. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 19, 273-299], to predict reading performance via computer-based testing (CBT) and subsequent reading achievement. All incoming freshmen completed self-assessment questions about L2 reading abilities before completing an online placement exam (OPLE). In order to assess subsequent reading performance, all students who tested into Advanced Spanish Grammar and Composition participated in an investigation during regular class time during the 3rd week of class. Participants read a short story, completed three different comprehension assessment tasks and additional self-assessment items. Overall, results of the present study suggest that self-assessment of L2 reading ability, as measured before and after reading via a 5-point scale, is not an accurate predictor variable for placement or subsequent performance. Advanced learners did not accurately estimate their L2 reading abilities as measured via CBT and in-class performance. Findings do not offer conclusive evidence about the value of self-assessment as a predictor of performance on CBT or as an indicator of subsequent classroom performance, but the current investigation provides indications as to the direction in which research on self-assessment of L2 reading needs to move. A more contextualized, criterion-referenced self-assessment instrument may be more beneficial for the placement of advanced readers in the USA. These results both echo and contradict prior research, which calls attention to the need for more investigations concerning instrumentation of self-assessment as a factor to be used in placement decisions for advanced learners.

AB  - The effects on second language reading comprehension of studying in the target-language country were investigated. Beginning- through advanced-level subjects ([Ss] N = 21, aged 20-34) at the Center for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language at Beijing U came from North America & Europe. The main test instrument, the Computer Adaptive Test for Reading Chinese, is a HyperCard (Macintosh) computer program; its advantages are detailed. Additional data were obtained through interviews. Results show that 14 Ss improved comprehension from pre- to post-test, 5 remained at the same level, & 2 declined. The numerous factors potentially affecting outcomes include starting proficiency, nature of classroom instruction & materials, number of Ss, study & reading habits, motivation, & timing of assessments. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 10 References.

AB  - A decision of whether to move from paper-and-pencil to computer-based tests is based largely on a careful weighing of the potential benefits of a change against its costs, disadvantages, and challenges. This paper briefly discusses the trade-offs involved in making such a transition, and then focuses on a relatively unexplored benefit of computer-based tests -- the control of construct-irrelevant factors that can threaten test score validity. Several unique advantages provided by computer-based tests are described, and how these advantages can be used to manage the effects of several common construct-irrelevant factors is discussed. Ultimately, the potential for expanded control may prove to be one of the most important benefits of computer-based tests.

AB  - Distance education is a discipline that offers solutions to some important education problems. Distance education, contribute to the solution to the problems such as; inequality of opportunities, lifelong education, the implementation of a series of individual and social goals that can contribute to and benefit from educational technology and self-learning. In distance education, methods of measurement and assessment must be consistent with the objectives and contents of teaching. A major interest of formative assessment is determining the students' learning level of each behavior in the interested unit. In summative assessment, performances of students on some units are measured broader than formative assessment. A computerized adaptive testing, CAT, is the test managed by computer in which each item is introduced and the decision to stop are dynamically imposed based on the students answers and his/her estimated knowledge level. In CAT applications, students do not take the same test. Despite item numbers and properties of items are different for the students; the precise of measures improves in positioning students on an ability or success continuum in CAT applications. In CAT applications, questions answered by a student depend on the student's ability or learning level. In item response theory, there are some models to estimate a student's ability level, such as three-parameter logistic model. Cheating in exams or other academic assignments can be defined as use resources not allowed to use or having someone else to take exams or assignments. Some precautions must be taken about cheating such as a live proctoring, using web cams, and using a plagiarism detection program.

AB  - The ability to predict the performance of student nurse anesthetists on the Computer Adaptive Testing National Certification Examination (CAT NCE) is an area of concern and interest to nurse anesthesia educators, students, nurse anesthesia administrators, clinicians, and employers. Upon completion of an accredited nurse anesthesia education program, students must successfully pass the CAT NCE in order to practice as a nurse anesthetist. One of the major outcomes of the education of student nurse anesthetists is to provide the community of interest with safe, competent anesthesia practitioners who can pass the CAT NCE. This study examined 13 academic, demographic, and pre-admission factors, which predict performance on the CAT NCE. This retrospective study reviewed the academic records of 128 student nurse anesthetists who took the CAT NCE between 1996 and 2003. The independent variables included the following: Baccalaureate of Science Degree in Nursing (BSN), nurse anesthesia program grade point average (GPA), age, gender, type of nursing background, number of years of nursing, type of BSN program (traditional, completion), and number of clinical cases and case hours in the nurse anesthesia program. The dependent variable was overall CAT NCE score. Results of the multiple regression analysis determined that 2 of the 13 independents variables were predictive of student performance on the CAT NCE. These variables included BSN GPA and type of BSN program, which accounted for 15.5% of the variance in overall CAT NCE scores. In addition, a strong positive correlation existed between BSN GPA and CAT NCE scores. All of the other remaining variables showed no significance in the multiple regression or correlation analyses. The results of this study will be used to examine and further define the admission criteria and curriculum requirements for nurse anesthesia education programs. In the computerized version of the NCE, each candidate's examination is individualized, allowing the results of the examination to be based on the student's individual knowledge, skills, and abilities to determine individual competence. The computer adaptive version of the NCE more precisely determines competence by testing each individual according to his or her abilities.

This study investigated three variations of prior information provided when taking an SAT: (1) no information (examinees selected item difficulty levels without prior information); (2) view (examinees inspected a typical item from each difficulty level prior to taking the SAT); and (3) route (examinees answered a typical item from each difficulty level and were informed prior to the SAT of the level that best matched their performance). Subjects were 218 students in an introductory statistics course, 85 percent of whom were undergraduates. No significant differences in test performance or anxiety were found as a function of providing examinees more information. Four tables are included. (Contains 9 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - The 1976 Educational Testing Service (ETS) Invitational Conference served as a platform for individuals who have been prominent in educational measurement and research to present their views on issues surrounding the testing controversy. The 1976 ETS "The Testing Scene: Chaos and Controversy," presents a historical review of events surrounding the testing controversy. In "Test Theory and the Public Interest," Frederic M. Lord suggested three alternatives for solving some of the problems of cultural test bias: weighted scoring techniques, tailored testing, and item sampling. Esther E. Diamond discussed test construction techniques that could alleviate bias, in "Testing: The Baby and the Bath Water Are Still With Us." In "One Man's View of Testing," William Raspberry stated that norming contributes to cultural bias. Thelma T. Daley discussed the effects of testing on students, in "The Student and Testing." In the final paper, "Where Ignorance Is Bliss--'Tis Folly to be Testing," Robert L. Thorndike recommended that tests be evaluated in light of the decisions that will be based upon their results. (BW)

AB  - PURPOSE: Patient-reported outcome measures are tools for evaluating symptoms, magnitude of limitations, baseline health status, and outcomes from the patient's perspective. Healthcare professional organizations and payers increasingly recommend PROMs for clinical care, but there lacks guidance regarding effective communication of PROMs with orthopedic surgery patients. This qualitative study aimed to identify (1) patient attitudes toward the use and communication of PROMs, and (2) what patients feel are the most relevant or important aspects of PROM results to discuss with their physicians. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a multispeciality orthopedic clinic. Three PROMs: the EuroQol-5 Dimension, the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, and the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test were shown and a semi-structured interview was conducted to elicit PROMs attitudes and preferences. Interviews were transcribed and inductive-deductively coded. Coded excerpts were aggregated to (1) identify major themes and (2) analyze how themes interacted. RESULT: Three themes emerged: (1) Beliefs toward the purpose of PROMs, (2) PROMs as a reflection of self, and (3) PROMs to facilitate communication and guide healthcare decisions. These themes informed a framework outlining the patient perspective on communicating PROMs during clinical care. CONCLUSION: Patient attitudes toward the use and communication of PROMs start with the incorporation of patient beliefs, which can facilitate or act as a barrier to engagement. Patients should ideally believe that PROMs are an accurate reflection of personal health state before incorporation into care. Clinicians should endeavor to communicate the purpose of a chosen PROM in line with a patient's unique needs and what they feel is most relevant to their own care. Aspects of PROMs results which may be helpful to address include providing context for what scores mean and how they are calculated, and using scores as a way to weigh risks and benefits of treatment and tracking progress over time. Future research can focus on the effect of communication strategies on patient outcomes and engagement in care.

AB  - Background: Many cognitive tests assess a limited developmental span, making longitudinal measurement for trials aimed at improving cognition challenging. Tests targeting transitional skills, which integrate foundational abilities into complex schemas, may be amenable to assessment across a wide developmental span. Furthermore, tablet-based tests permit computer adaptive testing (CAT), which is psychometrically more efficient and could increase testing motivation, especially for children with developmental delays. Such measures may be useful for research and clinical practice. Aims: Outline the creation of a novel, tablet-based concept formation test, and evaluate its feasibility in individuals with mental ages less than 24-months. Methods and procedures: Item generation, user interface construction, and pre-piloting were conducted in consultation with subject matter experts. Item content and interface parameters underwent iterative revisions, resulting in the pilot test. Outcomes and results: We created and piloted a tablet-based test of concept formation suitable for CAT-based administration with items of increasing difficulty based on target salience. We show feasibility in individuals with mental ages less than 24-months-old. Conclusions and implications: Tablet-based assessment of concept formation may be a useful outcome measure of an aspect of cognitive ability in young children. Future work will address optimizing the user interface and developing CAT administration. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Assessments for spatial working memory (SWM) in pet dogs that can detect age-related cognitive deficits in a single session may aid in diagnosing canine dementia and may facilitate translational research on Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease in humans. Adaptive testing procedures are widely used in single-session assessments for humans with diverse cognitive abilities. In this study, we designed and deployed two up-down staircase assessments for SWM in which 26 pet dogs were required to recall the location of a treat hidden behind one of two identical boxes following delays of variable length. In the first experiment, performance tended to decline with age but few dogs completed the test (n = 10). However, all of the dogs that participated in the second experiment (n = 24) completed the assessment and provided reliable evidence of learning and retaining the task. Delay length and age significantly predicted performance supporting the validity of this assessment. The relationships between age and performance were described by inverted U-shaped functions as both old and young dogs displayed deficits in weighted cumulative-scores and trial-by-trial performance. Thus, SWM in pet dogs may develop until midlife and decline thereafter. Exploratory analyses of non-mnemonic fixation strategies, sustained engagement, inhibitory control, and potential improvements for future SWM assessments which adopt this paradigm are also discussed.

AB  - Background: Suicide risk assessments are often challenging for clinicians, and therefore, biological markers are warranted as guiding tools in these assessments. Suicidal patients display increased cytokine levels in peripheral blood, although the composite inflammatory profile in the subjects is still unknown. It is also not yet established whether certain inflammatory changes are specific to suicidal subjects. To address this, we measured 45 immunobiological factors in peripheral blood and identified the biological profiles associated with cross-diagnostic suicide risk and depression, respectively. Methods: Sixty-six women with mood and anxiety disorders underwent computerized adaptive testing for mental health, assessing depression and suicide risk. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to uncover system level associations between suicide risk, depression, and the immunobiological factors in plasma. Secondary regression models were used to establish the sensitivity of the results to potential confounders, including age, body mass index (BMI), treatment and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The biological profile of patients assessed to be at increased suicide risk differed from that associated with depression. At the system level, a biological cluster containing increased levels of interleukin-6, lymphocytes, monocytes, white blood cell count and polymorphonuclear leukocyte count significantly impacted suicide risk, with the latter two inferring the strongest influence. The cytokine interleukin-8 was independently and negatively associated with increased suicide risk. The results remained after adjusting for confounders. Limitations: This study is cross-sectional and not designed to prove causality. Discussion: A unique immunobiological profile was linked to increased suicide risk. The profile was different from that observed in patients with depressive symptoms, and indicates that granulocyte mediated biological mechanisms could be activated in patients at risk for suicide.

AB  - Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) based on the bifactor model is suitable for tests with multidimensional bifactor measurement structures. Several item selection methods that proved to be more advantageous than the maximum Fisher information method are not practical for bifactor MCAT due to time-consuming computations resulting from high dimensionality. To make them applicable in bifactor MCAT, dimension reduction is applied to four item selection methods, which are the posterior-weighted Fisher D-optimality (PDO) and three non-Fisher information-based methods<e2><80><94>posterior expected Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler information (PKL), continuous entropy (CE), and mutual information (MI). They were compared with the Bayesian D-optimality (BDO) method in terms of estimation precision. When both the general and group factors are the measurement objectives, BDO, PDO, CE, and MI perform equally well and better than PKL. When the group factors represent nuisance dimensions, MI and CE perform the best in estimating the general factor, followed by the BDO, PDO, and PKL. How the bifactor pattern and test length affect estimation accuracy was also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: We review the papers presented at the NCI/DIA conference, to identify areas of controversy and uncertainty, and to highlight those aspects of item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) that require theoretical or empirical research in order to justify their application to patient reported outcomes (PROs). Background: IRT and CAT offer exciting potential for the development of a new generation of PRO instruments. However, most of the research into these techniques has been in non-healthcare settings, notably in education. Educational tests are very different from PRO instruments, and consequently problematic issues arise when adapting IRT and CAT to healthcare research. Results: Clinical scales differ appreciably from educational tests, and symptoms have characteristics distinctly different from examination questions. This affects the transferring of IRT technology. Particular areas of concern when applying IRT to PROs include inadequate software, difficulties in selecting models and communicating results, insufficient testing of local independence and other assumptions, and a need of guidelines for estimating sample size requirements. Similar concerns apply to differential item functioning (DIF), which is an important application of IRT. Multidimensional IRT is likely to be advantageous only for closely related PRO dimensions. Conclusions: Although IRT and CAT provide appreciable potential benefits, there is a need for circumspection. Not all PRO scales are necessarily appropriate targets for this methodology. Traditional psychometric methods, and especially qualitative methods, continue to have an important role alongside IRT. Research should be funded to address the specific concerns that have been identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We report on the selection of self-report measures for inclusion in the NIH Toolbox that are suitable for assessing the full range of negative affect including sadness, fear, and anger. The Toolbox is intended to serve as a 'core battery' of assessment tools for cognition, sensation, motor function, and emotional health that will help to overcome the lack of consistency in measures used across epidemiological, observational, and intervention studies. A secondary goal of the NIH Toolbox is the identification of measures that are flexible, efficient, and precise, an agenda best fulfilled by the use of item banks calibrated with models from item response theory (IRT) and suitable for adaptive testing. Results from a sample of 1763 respondents supported use of the adult and pediatric item banks for emotional distress from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) as a starting point for capturing the full range of negative affect in healthy individuals. Content coverage for the adult Toolbox was also enhanced by the development of a scale for somatic arousal using items from the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) and scales for hostility and physical aggression using items from the Buss<e2><80><93>Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ).

AB  - Since test scores are typically used to differentiate among persons, one highly desirable property of a test is that it measures equally well at all levels of a trait. The present study used simulated data and a Monte Carlo technique to investigate score bias and information characteristics of R. J. Owen's (1969) Bayesian adaptive testing strategy and to examine possible causes of test bias. Factors investigated included effects of an accurate prior <ce><b8> estimate, of item discriminations, and of fixed vs variable test length. Results indicate that estimates from Owen's method are affected by the prior <ce><b8> estimate used and that the method does not provide measurements that are unbiased and equiprecise unless an accurate prior <ce><b8> estimate is used.

AB  - Background: Supportive oncology practice can be enhanced by the integration of a brief and validated electronic patientreported outcome assessment into the electronic health record (EHR) and clinical workflow. Methods: Six hundred thirtysix women receiving gynecologic oncology outpatient care received instructions to complete clinical assessments through Epic MyChart, an EHR patient communication portal. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) were administered to assess fatigue, pain interference, physical function, depression, and anxiety. Checklists identified psychosocial concerns, informational and nutritional needs, and risk factors for inadequate nutrition. Assessment results, including PROMIS T scores with documented severity thresholds, were immediately populated in the EHR. Clinicians were notified of clinically elevated symptoms through EHR messages. EHR integration was designed to provide automated triage to social work providers for psychosocial concerns, to health educators for information, and to dietitians for nutritionrelated concerns. Results: Four thousand fortytwo MyChart messages sent, and 3203 (79%) were reviewed by patients. The assessment was started by 1493 patients (37%), and once they started, 93% (1386 patients) completed the assessment. According to first assessments only, 49.8% of the patients who reviewed the MyChart message completed the assessment. Mean PROMIS CAT T scores indicated a lower level of physical function and elevated anxiety in comparison with the general population. Fatigue, pain, and depression scores were comparable to those of the general population. Impaired physical functioning was the most common basis for clinical alerts and occurred in 4% of the patients. Conclusions: PROMIS CATs were used to measure common cancer symptoms in routine oncology outpatient care. Immediate EHR integration facilitated the use of symptom reporting as the basis for referral to psychosocial and supportive care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This study assessed whether the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer-adaptive tests (CATs) provided results similar to those of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) with a low patient burden. Methods: Secondary data analysis of 136 prostate cancer patients who completed the 53-item BSI and the PROMIS CATs assessing depression, anxiety, and hostility. Results: The PROMIS CATs and BSI correlated significantly in measures of depression (.85), anxiety (.76), and anger/hostility (.66; p < .001 for all). Using our BSI cutoff points for depression, anxiety, and anger/hostility, ROC analysis yielded areas under the curve of .966 [standard error (SE) = .014, p < .001], .975 (SE = .012, p < .001), and .952 (SE = .027, p < .001), respectively. Conclusions: PROMIS CATs were highly correlated with the BSI subscales, indicating that the CATs performed well compared with the BSI, a widely used psychosocial measure.

AB  - Explored the possibilities for using computerized adaptive testing in situations in which examinees are to be classified into 1 of 3 categories. Testing algorithms with 2 different statistical computation procedures are described and evaluated. The 1st computation procedure is based on statistical testing and the other on statistical estimation. Item selection methods based on maximum information (MI) considering content and exposure control are considered. The measurement quality of the proposed testing algorithms is reported. The results of the study are that a reduction of at least 22% in the mean number of items can be expected in a computerized adaptive test compared to an existing paper-and-pencil placement test. Furthermore, the results suggest that statistical testing is a promising alternative to statistical estimation. Finally, it is concluded that imposing constraints on the MI selection strategy does not negatively affect the quality of the testing algorithms.

AB  - Background: Up to 65% of individuals demonstrate poststroke cognitive impairments, which may increase hospital stay and caregiver burden. Randomized stroke clinical trials have emphasized physical recovery over cognition. Neuropsychological assessments have had limited utility in randomized clinical trials. These issues accentuate the need for a measure of functional cognition (the ability to accomplish everyday activities that rely on cognitive abilities, such as locating keys, conveying information, or planning activities). Objective: The aim of the study was to present the process used to establish domains of functional cognition for development of computer adaptive measure of functional cognition for stroke. Methods: Functional cognitive domains involved in identifying relevant neuropsychological constructs from the literature were conceptualized and finalized after advisory panel feedback from experts in neurology, neuropsychology, aphasiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology. Results: The following 17 domains were proposed: receptive aphasia, expressive aphasia, agraphia, alexia, calculation, visuospatial, visuoperceptual, visuoconstruction, attention, language usage, executive functions, orientation, processing speed, memory, working memory, mood, awareness and abstract reasoning. The advisory panel recommended retaining the first 12 domains. Recommended changes included: to address only encoding and retrieval of recent information in the memory domain; to add domains for limb apraxia and poststroke depression; and to keep orientation as a separate domain or reclassify it under memory or attention. The final 10 domains included: language, reading and writing, numeric/calculation, limb praxis, visuospatial function, social use of language, emotional function, attention, executive function, and memory. Conclusion: Conceptualizing domains of functional cognition is the first step in developing a computer adaptive measure of functional cognition for stroke. Additional steps include developing, refining, and field-testing items, psychometric analysis, and computer adaptive test programming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context. The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24 p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature. Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

AB  - Within the framework of item response theory (IRT), we developed a German version of an item bank, as well as a software application that can be employed to measure anxiety by means of a computer adaptive test (CAT). A sample of n = 2348 psychiatric and psychosomatic patients answered a set of up to 13 standardized questionnaires. 81 items drawn from these questionnaires were considered pertinent to the anxiety construct. Various tests were conducted to ensure the suitability of these items for an IRT-based assessment. After these tests, 50 items remained in the item bank and were calibrated using the Generalized Partial Credit Model. Simulation studies conducted on an independent sample of n = 1528 respondents indicate that 6-8 items suffice to measure the latent trait with high precision (standard error <e2><89><a4>0.32). CAT scores correlated highly with scores estimated from all available items (r = .97) and scale scores of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, state scale, r = .93). Within a routine clinical setting, 102 in-patients answered the Anxiety-CAT along with a number of established anxiety questionnaires. The correlation between the Anxiety-CAT and the STAI state scale was still high (r = .60), but lower than the correlations found in the simulation studies. The Anxiety-CAT was able to differentiate between mental health disorders in a similar manner as established questionnaires. These results suggest that the Anxiety-CAT does indeed exhibit the advantages expected from theory, but the results of further studies are needed in order to judge its full potential for research and clinical practice.

AB  - Emotion regulation (ER) plays a vital role in individuals<e2><80><99> well-being and successful functioning. In this study, we attempted to develop a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to efficiently evaluate ER, namely the CAT-ER. The initial CAT-ER item bank comprised 154 items from six commonly used ER scales, which were completed by 887 participants recruited in China. We conducted unidimensionality testing, item response theory (IRT) model comparison and selection, and IRT item analysis including local independence, item fit, differential item functioning, and item discrimination. Sixty-three items with good psychometric properties were retained in the final CAT-ER. Then, two CAT simulation studies were implemented to assess the CAT-ER, which revealed that the CAT-ER developed in this study performed reasonably well, considering that it greatly lessened the test items and time without losing measurement accuracy.

AB  - Purpose: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) is a new, state-of-the-art assessment system for measuring patient-reported health and well-being of adults and children. It has the potential to be more valid, reliable, and responsive than existing PROMs. The items banks are designed to be self-reported and completed by children aged 8<e2><80><93>18 years. The PROMIS items can be administered in short forms or through computerized adaptive testing. This paper describes the translation and cultural adaption of nine PROMIS item banks (151 items) for children in Dutch<e2><80><93>Flemish. Methods: The translation was performed by FACITtrans using standardized PROMIS methodology and approved by the PROMIS Statistical Center. The translation included four forward translations, two back-translations, three independent reviews (at least two Dutch, one Flemish), and pretesting in 24 children from the Netherlands and Flanders. Results: For some items, it was necessary to have separate translations for Dutch and Flemish: physical function<e2><80><94>mobility (three items), anger (one item), pain interference (two items), and asthma impact (one item). Challenges faced in the translation process included scarcity or overabundance of possible translations, unclear item descriptions, constructs broader/smaller in the target language, difficulties in rank ordering items, differences in unit of measurement, irrelevant items, or differences in performance of activities. By addressing these challenges, acceptable translations were obtained for all items. Conclusion: The Dutch<e2><80><93>Flemish PROMIS items are linguistically equivalent to the original USA version. Short forms are now available for use, and entire item banks are ready for cross-cultural validation in the Netherlands and Flanders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Undergraduates participated in 3 experiments related to self-adapted testing. Experiment 1 demonstrated that, in comparison with computerized adaptive testing, self-adapted testing reduced the influence of anxiety on performance but took longer and was less efficient. Experiment 2 indicated that benefits of self-adapted testing cannot be attributed solely to item ordering. Instead, active choice of item difficulty seems to be necessary. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the provision of feedback increased the efficiency of the test but had no effect on estimates of ability derived. The potential of self-adapted testing to reduce the influence of extraneous sources of variation in test performance is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anchor and distributionbased methods were combined to evaluate and establish minimally important differences (MIDs) for two PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures in an outpatient chronic pain population. These included the computeradaptive test (CAT) versions of two PROMIS measures: Depressive Symptoms and AnxietyRelated Symptoms (PROMIS; Cella, Gershon, Lai & Choi). Participants (n = 170) undergoing a behavioral medicine evaluation in an interdisciplinary pain management clinic completed two PROMIS CATs and multiple clinical anchor measures/questions. Modeled after similar analyses (Yost, Eton, Garcia, & Cella), three a priori criteria were used to select usable crosssectional anchorbased MID estimates; these included a minimum Spearman correlation of .3 between the PROMIS measure and anchor item/categories, a minimum comparison group sample size of 10 within each anchor, and an effect size between .2 and .8 for each anchorbased estimate. For each PROMIS measure, the mean standard error of measurement was calculated and incorporated into MID analyses. Using a large sample (n = 170), a number of the crosssectional Tscore anchorbased MID estimates (57%) were not included due to failure to meet a priori criteria. Based on the analyses, the following Tscore MID ranges are recommended: Depression CAT (3.55.5) and Anxiety CAT (3.05.5). The average effect sizes for MID estimates ranged from .32 to .57. This study is among the first to address MIDs for PROMIS measures; it is the first study to establish usable MIDs for psychological symptoms on outpatients with chronic/persistent pain. The results may be used to gauge minimally important clinical difference and/or treatment response for individuals within this patient population. MIDs for PROs are particularly useful when treatment responses are significant to the patient but are difficult to evaluate during the clinical visit.

AB  - COVID-19 prompted distress and increased reliance on digital mental health interventions, which previously demonstrated low rates of retention and adherence. This single-arm trial evaluated whether self-guided, web-based, positive affect regulation skills (PARK) were engaging and associated with changes in well-being during the pandemic. Over 6 weeks, PARK delivers brief lessons and practices in skills designed to increase positive emotions: noticing positive events, savoring, gratitude, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, and self-compassion. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests of anxiety, depression, social isolation, positive affect, and meaning and purpose were administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months after baseline. Retention and usage of PARK were measured by the web-based assessment and intervention platforms. The sample (n = 616) was predominantly female, non-Hispanic, white, and well-educated. Of those who completed baseline, only 42% completed a follow-up assessment; 30% never logged into PARK. Among those who did, 86% used at least one skill, but only 14% completed PARK. Across retention and usage metrics, older age predicted more engagement. In multivariable models, people of color and people with greater baseline anxiety were more likely to complete PARK. All well-being indicators improved over time, with greater improvements in anxiety and social isolation among participants who accessed at least one PARK skill compared to those who did not. Retention and usage rates mirrored pre-pandemic trends, but within this select sample, predictors of engagement differed from prior research. Findings underscore the need for additional efforts to ensure equitable access to digital mental health interventions and research. Trials registration: NCT04367922.

AB  - Decline in cognitive ability is a core diagnostic criterion for dementia. Knowing the extent of decline requires a baseline score from which change can be reckoned. In the absence of prior cognitive ability scores, vocabulary-based cognitive tests are used to estimate premorbid cognitive ability. It is important that such tests are short yet informative, to maximize information and practicability. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) is commonly used to estimate premorbid intelligence. People are asked to pronounce 50 words ranging from easy to difficult but whether its words conform to a hierarchy is unknown. Five hundred eighty-seven healthy community-dwelling older people with known age 11 IQ scores completed the NART as part of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study. Mokken analysis was used to explore item responses for unidimensional, ordinal, and hierarchical scales. A strong hierarchical scale ('mini-NART') of 23 of the 50 items was identified. These items are invariantly ordered across all ability levels. The validity of the interpretation of this briefer scale<e2><80><99>s score as an estimate of premorbid ability was examined using the actual age 11 IQ score. The mini-NART accounted for a similar amount of the variance in age 11 IQ as the full NART (NART = 46.5%, mini-NART = 44.8%). The mini-NART is proposed as a useful short clinical tool to estimate prior cognitive ability. The mini-NART has clinical relevance, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items allowing for sensitive measurement, and adaptive testing, reducing test administration time, and patient stress.

AB  - PURPOSE: We are developing an age-related macular degeneration (AMD) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) item bank, applicable to Western and Asian populations. We report primarily on content generation and refinement, but also compare the HRQoL issues reported in our study with Western studies and current AMD-HRQoL questionnaires. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, qualitative study of AMD patients attending the Singapore National Eye Centre (May-December 2019), items/domains were generated from: (1) AMD-specific questionnaires; (2) published articles; (3) focus groups/semi-structured interviews with AMD patients (n = 27); and (4) written feedback from retinal experts. Following thematic analysis, items were systematically refined to a minimally representative set and pre-tested using cognitive interviews with 16 AMD patients. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients (mean +/- standard deviation age 67.9 +/- 7.0; 59.2% male), 18 (66.7%), two (7.4%), and seven (25.9%) had no, early-intermediate, and late/advanced AMD (better eye), respectively. Whilst some HRQoL issues, e.g. activity limitation, mobility, lighting, and concerns were similarly reported by Western patients and covered by other questionnaires, others like anxiety about intravitreal injections, work tasks, and financial dependency were novel. Overall, 462 items within seven independent HRQoL domains were identified: Activity limitation, Lighting, Mobility, Emotional, Concerns, AMD management, and Work. Following item refinement, items were reduced to 219, with 31 items undergoing amendment. CONCLUSION: Our 7-domain, 219-item AMD-specific HRQoL instrument will undergo psychometric testing and calibration for computerized adaptive testing. The future instrument will enable users to precisely, rapidly, and comprehensively quantify the HRQoL impact of AMD and associated treatments, with item coverage relevant across several populations.

AB  - Purpose: Current patient-reported outcomes for female urinary incontinence (UI) are limited by their inability to be tailored. Our objective is to describe the development and field testing of seven item banks designed to measure domains identified as important UI in females (UIf). We also describe the calibration and validation properties of the UIf-item banks, which allow for more efficient computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in the future. Methods: The UIf-measures included 168 items covering seven domains: Stress UI (SUI), overactive bladder (OAB), urinary frequency, physical, social and emotional health impact and adaptation. Items underwent rigorous qualitative development and psychometric testing across two sites. Items were calibrated using item response theory and evaluated for internal consistency, construct validity and responsiveness. Results: A total of 750 women (249 SUI, 249 OAB and 252 mixed UI) participated. Mean age was 55 <c2><b1> 14 years, and 23 % were Hispanic and 80 % white. In addition to face and content validity, the measures demonstrated good internal consistency (coefficient alpha 0.92<e2><80><93>0.98) and unidimensionality. There was evidence for construct validity with moderate-to-strong correlations with the UDI (r<e2><80><99>s <e2><89><a5> 0.6) and IIQ (r<e2><80><99>s = <e2><89><a5>0.6) scales. The measures were responsive to change for SUI treatment (paired t test p < .001, ES range 1.3<e2><80><93>2.9; SRM range 1.3<e2><80><93>2.5) and OAB treatment (paired t test p < .05 for all domains except social health impact and adaptation, ES range 0.3<e2><80><93>1.5, SRM range 0.4<e2><80><93>1.0). The measures were responsive based on concurrent changes with the UDI and IIQ (p < 0.05). CAT versions were developed and pilot-tested. Conclusions: The UIf-item banks demonstrate good psychometric characteristics and are a sufficiently valid set of customizable tools for measuring UI symptoms and life impact.

AB  - Comments on an article by Robert D. Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2020-75129-001[/rid]). Gibbons et al. demonstrated the utility of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) based on multidimensional item response theory for the assessment of depression, anxiety, mania/hypomania, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and suicidality in children and adolescents. The web-based versions of the KSADS-COMP has many advantages over its predecessor, including streamlined assessment time, automated scoring, branching and tracking of supplements, and availability of symptom-level and diagnostic reports in real time. Both the self- and the clinician-administered versions of the KSADS-COMP are particularly useful when conducting telehealth assessments. The K-CAT and KSADS-COMP both leverage technology to make the diagnostic process more efficient. In addition to dimensional measures of psychopathology, the KSADS-COMP provides categorical diagnoses, the necessary information to facilitate differential diagnosis, and information about the context of the child<e2><80><99>s life.

AB  - Diabetes is an increasing global health and economic burden that is frequently associated with and worsened by clinically significant depression or anxiety. This chapter focuses on the history and evolution of the concept of depression and will also describe some of the uncertainties and controversy surrounding psychiatric nosology. Depression as a syndrome of pathological emotions should be diagnosed using operationalized criteria; however, at the same time, depression should not be reified as a discrete construct with absolute boundaries. Depression is often comorbid with anxiety and other mental disorders, which could be clinically important for diabetes. As with other medical syndromes, there is substantial heterogeneity between patients within psychiatric diagnostic groups. Clinically significant depression is defined using cutoff scores for self-rated symptoms using various psychometrics, which correlate reasonably well with operationalized diagnoses. Both methods classify persons into clinically significant dichotomies of depression for diabetes. This chapter considers the implications of these diagnoses for clinical practice and makes suggestions as to the way forward both in terms of the identification of people with comorbid depression and diabetes and for treatment and care. Computerized assessment, for example, with computerized adaptive testing (CAT), can facilitate time-efficient depression screening in busy clinic settings.

AB  - We introduce the Berlin Numeracy Test, a new psychometrically sound instrument that quickly assesses statistical numeracy and risk literacy. We present 21 studies (n = 5336) showing robust psychometric discriminability across 15 countries (e.g., Germany, Pakistan, Japan, USA) and diverse samples (e.g., medical professionals, general populations, Mechanical Turk web panels). Analyses demonstrate desirable patterns of convergent validity (e.g., numeracy, general cognitive abilities), discriminant validity (e.g., personality, motivation), and criterion validity (e.g., numerical and non-numerical questions about risk). The Berlin Numeracy Test was found to be the strongest predictor of comprehension of everyday risks (e.g., evaluating claims about products and treatments; interpreting forecasts), doubling the predictive power of other numeracy instruments and accounting for unique variance beyond other cognitive tests (e.g., cognitive reflection, working memory, intelligence). The Berlin Numeracy Test typically takes about three minutes to complete and is available in multiple languages and formats, including a computer adaptive test that automatically scores and reports data to researchers (www.riskliteracy.org). The online forum also provides interactive content for public outreach and education, and offers a recommendation system for test format selection. Discussion centers on construct validity of numeracy for risk literacy, underlying cognitive mechanisms, and applications in adaptive decision support.

AB  - This study explored calibrating a large item bank for use in multidimensional health measurement with computerized adaptive testing, using both item responses and response time (RT) information. The Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care is a patient-reported outcomes measure comprised of three correlated scales (Applied Cognition, Daily Activities, and Mobility). All items from each scale are Likert type, so that a respondent chooses a response from an ordered set of four response options. The most appropriate item response theory model for analyzing and scoring these items is the multidimensional graded response model (MGRM). During the field testing of the items, an interviewer read each item to a patient and recorded, on a tablet computer, the patient's responses and the software recorded RTs. Due to the large item bank with over 300 items, data collection was conducted in four batches with a common set of anchor items to link the scale. van der Linden's (2007) hierarchical modeling framework was adopted. Several models, with or without interviewer as a covariate and with or without interaction between interviewer and items, were compared for each batch of data. It was found that the model with the interaction between interviewer and item, when the interaction effect was constrained to be proportional, fit the data best. Therefore, the final hierarchical model with a lognormal model for RT and the MGRM for response data was fitted to all batches of data via a concurrent calibration. Evaluation of parameter estimates revealed that (1) adding response time information did not affect the item parameter estimates and their standard errors significantly; (2) adding response time information helped reduce the standard error of patients' multidimensional latent trait estimates, but adding interviewer as a covariate did not result in further improvement. Implications of the findings for follow up adaptive test delivery design are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Interest in developing computerized adaptive testing (CAT) under cognitive diagnostic models has increased recently. Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) attempt to classify examinees into the correct latent class profile so as to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of each examinee whereas CAT algorithms choose items from the item bank to achieve that goal as efficiently as possible. Most of the research in CD-CAT uses the posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler (PWKL) index due to its high efficiency. The PWKL index integrated the posterior probabilities of examinees' latent class profiles into the KL information, and thus improved item selection efficiency considerably. However, the PWKL index only used examinee-based information to assess the relative importance of each latent class profile. The current study attempted to take advantage of not only the examinee-base information but also the item-based information that could be readily obtained from items. In a sense, the PWKL index should be regarded as single-source index. This paper introduced four new multiple-source item selection methods, GIDPWKL, AIDPWKL, CIDPWKL, and KLEDPWKL respectively, which can be modified from the PWKL index by combining the item discrimination information. Two simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the new methods' efficiency against the PWKL index and mutual information (MI) index in the DINA model with the exposure control. The effects of different factors were investigated: the Q matrix structure (simple vs. complex), item quality (high vs. low) and test length (moderate vs. short). Simulation results indicated that: (1) In most cases, the shorter the test length was. the higher AACCR and PCCR values the four new methods would have in the fix-length test. The GIDPWKL index had the highest average attribute correct classification rate and pattern correct classification rate among the six methods, and followed by AIDPWKL index. The performance among the CIDPWKL. KLEDPWKL. and MI depends on the experimental conditions. (2) In most cases, the higher the item quality was. the more advantage the four new methods would have in the fix-length test. (3) The structure of the Q matrix affected the performance of different item selection methods. (4) In the variable-length test, the mean of test length across all examinees for the four new methods and MI method were all smaller than those in the PWKL method. As a whole, the performance of the GIDPWKL index was the best, and should be recommended in practice where had the similar testing scenarios.

AB  - Along with the development of computer technology and increasing needs of individual learning, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has received more and more attention. However, the problem of the test security is becoming a new challenge to the CAT, for example, excessive exposure of the test items might weaken the efficiency and equity of the CAT. Therefore, constructing a large-scale and high-quality CAT item bank is highly demanded The traditional method of constructing a CAT item bank involves four steps: first, the items are developed by the experts according to the test specification and blueprint; second, a representative sample of examinees is recruited to take the test; Then, the calibration of item parameters and testing of the model-data fit will be conducted afterward. Finally, items of high-quality and its item parameters will be added into the item bank based on the pre-analysis. However, several problems exist in the above traditional method. First, a large number of test takers are needed, which is time-consuming and expensive. Second, the security of the items cannot be guaranteed in the pilot test. Third, complicated techniques of equating may have to be used to construct a good item bank, which may also affect the security of the items, especially when the anchor items are repeatedly used in the test equating process. Thus, if the raw items can be seeded in the CAT process and the item parameters combined with the examinee abilities estimated at the same time, it will be significant for the construction of CAT item bank. The research in this area has not been widely conducted and reported in the domestic journals, although this issue has been a big topic for foreign researchers. Thus, This study aims to explore how to insert raw items and estimate the item parameters in CAT and investigate the efficient strategies with high security for enlarging the item bank. A new online calibration method is proposed based on the principle of adaption in CAT, provided there is a small-scale item pool. And the formula of initial value during the stage of the iteration is determined. When the ability parameter has been estimated, the conditional maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) will be implemented to estimate item parameters in the raw items. First, the difficulty parameter could be obtained through CMLE. Second, the discrimination parameter could be estimated with the abilities and difficulty parameter and the initial value of the discrimination parameter could be gained through CMLE. Third, the difficulty parameter could be estimated when the discrimination parameter and abilities are known. Repeat the second and the third steps until the stop condition is satisfied. Simulation of Monte Carlo has been employed to estimate the parameters of raw items with the one-parameter Logistic and two-parameter Logistic models in the study and good result has been gained.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(3) of Psychological Assessment (see record [rid]2014-16017-001[/rid]). The mean, standard deviation and alpha coefficient originally reported in Table 1 should be 74.317, 10.214 and .802, respectively. The validity coefficients in the last column of Table 4 are affected as well. Correcting this error did not change the substantive interpretations of the results, but did increase the mean, standard deviation, alpha coefficient, and validity coefficients reported for the Honesty subscale in the text and in Tables 1 and 4. The corrected versions of Tables 1 and Table 4 are shown in the erratum.] Item response theory (IRT) models were applied to dichotomous and polytomous scoring of the Self-Deceptive Enhancement and Impression Management subscales of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (Paulhus, 1991, 1999). Two dichotomous scoring methods reflecting exaggerated endorsement and exaggerated denial of socially desirable behaviors were examined. The 1- and 2-parameter logistic models (1PLM, 2PLM, respectively) were applied to dichotomous responses, and the partial credit model (PCM) and graded response model (GRM) were applied to polytomous responses. For both subscales, the 2PLM fit dichotomous responses better than did the 1PLM, and the GRM fit polytomous responses better than did the PCM. Polytomous GRM and raw scores for both subscales yielded higher test<e2><80><93>retest and convergent validity coefficients than did PCM, 1PLM, 2PLM, and dichotomous raw scores. Information plots showed that the GRM provided consistently high measurement precision that was superior to that of all other IRT models over the full range of both construct continuums. Dichotomous scores reflecting exaggerated endorsement of socially desirable behaviors provided noticeably weak precision at low levels of the construct continuums, calling into question the use of such scores for detecting instances of 'faking bad.' Dichotomous models reflecting exaggerated denial of the same behaviors yielded much better precision at low levels of the constructs, but it was still less precision than that of the GRM. These results support polytomous over dichotomous scoring in general, alternative dichotomous scoring for detecting faking bad, and extension of GRM scoring to situations in which IRT offers additional practical advantages over classical test theory (adaptive testing, equating, linking, scaling, detecting differential item functioning, and so forth).

AB  - This study aimed to validate the PROMIS<c2><ae> pediatric v2.0 Anger scale in the Dutch general population, provide reference data, and compare reliability and relative efficiency between the full-length scale, its short-form, computerized adaptive test (CAT), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQLTM) emotional functioning (EF) subscale scores. Children (N = 1,328), representative of the Dutch population, were asked to complete the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale (8<e2><80><93>18 years) and PedsQLTM (8<e2><80><93>17 years). A graded response model (GRM) was fit to the data. Structural validity was assessed by checking item-fit statistics (S<e2><88><92>X2, p < .001 = misfit). For construct validity, a moderate correlation (Pearson<e2><80><99>s r > 0.50) was expected between the Anger scale and PedsQLTM EF subscale score. Dutch mean T score based on the U.S. model was calculated to provide reference data and cut-offs. Standard error of measurement (SE(<ce><b8>)) was used to assess reliability (SE(<ce><b8>) < .32 = .90 reliability). Relative efficiency was calculated (1 <e2><88><92> SE(<ce><b8>)2/N items) to compare how good the measures performed relative to the amount of items administered. In total, 527 children completed the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale, of which 482 completed the PedsQLTM. Structural validity was sufficient as no items displayed misfit (S<e2><88><92>X2 = 22.9<e2><80><93>40.3, p > .001). The Anger scale score correlated moderately (Pearson<e2><80><99>s r = .64) with the PedsQLTM EF subscale score. Dutch mean T score was 44.20 (SD = 11.39), with cut-offs of >52.2 for moderate and <e2><89><a5>62.3 for severe symptoms. Reliable measurements were obtained at the population mean and >2SD in the clinically relevant direction. CAT outperformed all other measures in efficiency. The PROMIS pediatric Anger scale displayed sufficient psychometric properties within the Dutch population and reference data are available. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement<e2><80><94>This study provides evidence that the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale has good psychometric properties in the Dutch general population. This scale can thus be implemented in clinical practice and for pediatric research in the Netherlands to solve the problem that validated Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) assessing anger in a pediatric population are missing, improve interpretability and comparison of scores and reduce the burden of completing PROMs for pediatric patients.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly using computerized tests (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in selection systems. A 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil--computerized) <c3><97> 2 (technical level of the job: high technical job--low technical job) <c3><97> 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design was used to assess proposed relationships between reactions to tests, their antecedents, and their consequences. While test-takers' post-test perceptions did not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, computer anxiety and experience with computing were important factors in performing successfully. Significant relationships were found between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing computerized selection tools.

KW  - Adaptive Testing
AB  - In the past decade, some paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests have been replaced by computerized adaptive testing (CAT) within many large-scale standardized testing programs. However, many researches and applications on CAT had limitations because most of the CAT did not allow examinees to review and change their answers. Among the operative CAT applications, there was only one that incorporated item review. Not allowing examinees to review and change their answers would result in test pressure and affect their performances. Moreover, a majority of examinees manifested a clear preference for item review because they believed that the inclusion of item review made the test fairer and considered it to be a disadvantage if review was disallowed. The CAT test organizers did not allow examinees to review and change answers mainly because they were apprehensive that examinees would use the deceptive Wainer strategy in the review stage to obtain positively biased ability estimates, consequently affecting the fairness and precision of the test. If we could provide a solution that not only allowed examinees to review and change answers but that was also able to deal with the Wainer strategy, the meaning would be great for the development of CAT. Until now, there have been few relevant studies on this topic worldwide. Moreover, the previous studies had a nonnegligible disadvantage, in that the researchers only recorded the answers of the review stage and used them as a basis for scoring, without considering the answers of the adaptive stage. We assumed that comprehensively considering the answers before and after review could produce a more accurate ability estimation. Therefore, this paper employed a new scoring method and attempted to deal with the Wainer strategy: V<ce><b1>j = Beta <c3><97> U<ce><b1>j + (1 <e2><88><92> Beta) <c3><97> U<ce><b1>, j + m This study involved two experiments. Experiment 1 used the Monte Carlo method to simulate the entire process of CAT that allows the reviewing and changing of answers, with the aim of investigating the influence of different beta values on ability estimation. Experiment 2 used simulation data generated by the Monte Carlo method to evaluate the effectiveness of the Wainer strategy and attempted to deal with the strategy by using a new scoring method. The simulation results of Experiment 1 indicated the following. First, comprehensively considering the answers before and after review did produce a more accurate ability estimation, and the most accurate estimates occurred when beta = 0.50. Second, the share of examinees who changed their answers was 66.80%; further, 6.40% of the answers were changed, and 75% of the modified answers represented changes from incorrect to correct answers. Experiment 2 indicated the following: When using the new scoring method, the ability estimates generated by the CAT involving the use of the Wainer strategy obviously diverged from the true ability values. Moreover, the bias increased as the true ability value increased. The new scoring method employed in this study was not able to effectively deal with the Wainer strategy because of the abnormal ability estimates and abnormal estimated standard error. However, through a simulation experiment, we found the following: When beta = 0, comprehensively considering the expected a posteriori (EAP) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) ability estimates of CAT involving the use of the Wainer strategy succeeded in roughly dealing with the Wainer strategy. Our future task involves developing a more accurate method to deal with the Wainer Strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether school readiness differs between children born <30 weeks' gestation who are classified as at risk for developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and those who are not. METHODS: This study was a prospective cohort study of children born <30 weeks' gestation. Children were classified as at risk for DCD at a corrected age of 4 to 5 years if they scored <16th centile on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition (MABC-2), had a full scale IQ score of >/=80 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV), and had no cerebral palsy. Children were assessed on 4 school readiness domains: (1) health/physical development [Physical Health domain of Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, and Little Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire], (2) social-emotional development (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and PedsQL psychosocial domains), (3) cognitive skills/general knowledge (WPPSI-IV), and (4) language skills (WPPSI-IV). RESULTS: Of 123 children assessed, 16 were ineligible (IQ < 80 or cerebral palsy: n = 15; incomplete MABC-2: n = 1); 28 of 107 (26%) eligible children were at risk for DCD. Children at risk for DCD had poorer performance on all school readiness domains, with group differences of more than 0.4 SD in health/physical development, social-emotional development, and language skills and up to 0.8 SD for cognitive skills/general knowledge compared with those not at risk of DCD. CONCLUSION: Being at risk for DCD in children born <30 weeks' gestation is associated with challenges in multiple school readiness domains, not only the health/physical domain.

AB  - Self-report scales that measure the severity of common mental disorders (e.g., unipolar depression and anxiety disorders) based on subjective signs and symptoms have formed the cornerstone of assessment in clinical psychology and psychiatry for many years. This chapter aims to provide a broad overview of existing, widely used, self-report scales for assessing the presence and frequency of symptoms of depression and anxiety. It focuses on some of the more widely used scales in research and clinical settings with specific reference to their psychometric properties and cross-cultural applicability. The chapter discusses emerging methods that apply modem psychometric techniques to develop the next generation of self-report scales, with the aim of improving the reliability, validity, and comparability of self-report data, while minimizing respondent burden and increasing efficiency via electronic administration. It focuses on three applications of modern test theory to the self-report assessment of mental disorders: item banking, adaptive testing and data-driven short scales, and scale equating. The chapter outlines the strengths and some current criticisms of these techniques and highlights future directions for research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) study were to (1) conceptualize children's subjective well-being (SWB) and (2) produce item pools with excellent content validity for calibration and use in computerized adaptive testings (CATs). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Children's SWB was defined through semistructured interviews with experts, children (aged 8-17 years), parents, and a systematic literature review to identify item concepts comprehensively covering the full spectrum of SWB. Item concepts were transformed into item expressions and evaluated for comprehensibility using cognitive interviews, reading level analysis, and translatability review. RESULTS: Children's SWB comprises affective (positive affect) and global evaluation components (life satisfaction). Input from experts, children, parents, and the literature indicated that the eudaimonic dimension of SWB-that is, a sense of meaning and purpose-could be evaluated. Item pools for life satisfaction (56 items), positive affect (53 items), and meaning and purpose (55 items) were produced. Small differences in comprehensibility of some items were observed between children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: The SWB measures for children are the first to assess both the hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of SWB. Both children and youth seem to understand the concepts of a meaningful life, optimism, and goal orientation.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is fundamental in modern society because it represents an important source of innovation, employment, productivity, and growth. While the first theoretical models arose from economic and sociological approaches, psychology provides models that integrate different aspects such as cognitions, attitudes and personality, which allow a more detailed study. The purpose of this paper is to show the main contributions of psychology to the assessment of the enterprising personality. For this purpose, the main models and instruments developed to date were reviewed. The results confirm that the enterprising personality has a multidimensional structure and eight personality traits can be highlighted: achievement motivation, risk-taking, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, innovativeness, internal locus of control, and optimism. From a methodological point of view, Item Response Theory and Computerised Adaptive Tests represent the most advanced and modern methods for assessing enterprising personality. There are currently several measurement instruments available. Future areas of research should be directed at the construction of multidimensional models as well as providing alternatives that facilitate a reduction in social desirability and other biases inherent in self-reports.

AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is widely used as an outcome measure in the evaluation of treatment interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In order to address challenges associated with existing fixed-length measures (e.g., too long to be used routinely, too short to ensure both content validity and reliability), a COPD-specific item bank (COPD-SIB) was developed. Methods: Items were selected based on literature review and interviews with Dutch COPD patients, with a strong focus on both content validity and item comprehension. The psychometric quality of the item bank was evaluated using Mokken Scale Analysis and parametric Item Response Theory, using data of 666 COPD patients. Results: The final item bank contains 46 items that form a strong scale, tapping into eight important themes that were identified based on literature review and patient interviews: Coping with disease/symptoms, adaptability; Autonomy; Anxiety about the course/end-state of the disease, hopelessness; Positive psychological functioning; Situations triggering or enhancing breathing problems; Symptoms; Activity; Impact. Conclusions: The 46-item COPD-SIB has good psychometric properties and content validity. Items are available in Dutch and English. The COPD-SIB can be used as a stand-alone instrument, or to inform computerised adaptive testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent research on the psychological effects of different design decisions in computerized adaptive tests indicates that the maximum-information item selection rule fails to optimize respondents' test-taking motivation. While several recent studies have investigated psychological reactions to computerized adaptive tests using a consistently higher base success rate, little research has so far been conducted on the psychometric (primarily test reliability and bias) and psychological effects (e.g. test-taking motivation, self-confidence) of using mixtures of highly informative (p = .50) and easier items (p = .80) in the item selection process. The present paper thus compares these modifications to item selection with a classical maximum-information algorithm. In a simulation study the effect of the different item selection algorithms on measurement precision and bias in the person parameter estimates is evaluated. To do so, the item pool of the Lexical Knowledge Test, measuring crystallized intelligence and self-confidence, is used. The study indicated that modifications using base success probabilities over p = .70 lead to reduced measurement accuracy and--more seriously--a bias in the person parameter estimates for higher ability respondents. However, this was not the case for the motivator item algorithm, occasionally administering easier items as well. The second study (n = 191) thus compared the unmodified maximum-information algorithm with two motivator item algorithms, which differed with regard to the percentage of motivator items presented. The results indicate that respondents yield higher self-confidence estimates under the motivator item conditions. Furthermore, the three conditions did not differ from each other with regard to the total test duration. It can be concluded that a small number of easier motivator items is sufficient to preserve test-taking motivation throughout the test without a loss of test economy.

AB  - Calibration errors are inevitable and should not be ignored during the estimation of item parameters. Items with calibration error can affect the measurement results of tests. One of the purposes of the current study is to investigate the impacts of the calibration errors during the estimation of item parameters on the measurement accuracy, average test length, and test efficiency for variable-length cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing. The other purpose is to examine the methods for reducing the adverse effects of calibration errors. Simulation results show that (1) calibration error has negative effect on the measurement accuracy for the deterministic input, noisy 'and' gate (DINA) model, and the reduced reparameterized unified model; (2) the average test lengths is shorter, and the test efficiency is overestimated for items with calibration errors; (3) the compensatory reparameterized unified model (CRUM) is less affected by the calibration errors, and the classification accuracy, average test length, and test efficiency are slightly stable in the CRUM framework; (4) methods such as improving the quality of items, using large calibration sample to calibrate the parameters of items, as well as using cross-validation method can reduce the adverse effects of calibration errors on CD-CAT.

AB  - Introduction: The PROMIS Smoking Initiative has developed six item banks for assessment related to cigarette smoking among adult smokers (Nicotine Dependence, Coping Expectancies, Emotional and Sensory Expectancies, Health Expectancies, Psychosocial Expectancies, and Social Motivations). This article evaluates the psychometric performance of the banks when administered via short form (SF), computer adaptive test (CAT), and by mode of administration (computer vs. paper-and-pencil). Methods: Data are from two sources: an internet sample (N = 491) of daily and nondaily smokers who completed both SFs and CATs via the web and a community sample (N = 369) that completed either paper-and-pencil or computer administration of the SFs at two time points. First a CAT version of the PROMIS Smoking Assessment Toolkit was evaluated by comparing item administration rates and scores to the SF administration. Next, we considered the effect of computer versus paper-and-pencil administration on scoring and test-retest reliability. Results: Across the domains approximately 5.4 to 10.3 items were administered on average for the CAT. SF and CAT item response theory-scores were correlated from 0.82 to 0.92 across the domains. Cronbach<e2><80><99>s alpha for the four- to eight-item SFs among daily smokers ranged from .80 to .91 and .82 to .91 for paper-and-pencil and computer administrations, respectively. Test-retest reliability of the SFs ranged from 0.79 to 0.89 across mode of administration. Conclusions: Results indicate that the SF and CAT and computer and paper-and-pencil administrations provide highly comparable scores for daily and nondaily smokers, but preference for SF or CAT administration may vary by smoking domain.

AB  - Usually, it is assumed that achievement tests measure maximum performance. However, test performance is not only associated with ability but also with motivational and emotional aspects of test-taking. These aspects are influenced by individual success probability, which in turn depends on the ratio of individual ability to item difficulty (ability-difficulty fit). The impact of ability-difficulty fit on test-taking motivation and emotion is unknown and rarely considered when interpreting test results. N = 9,452 ninth-graders in Germany (PISA 2006) completed a mathematics test and a questionnaire on test-taking effort (motivation) and boredom/daydreaming (emotion). Overall, mean item difficulty exceeded individual ability. Ability-difficulty fit was positively linear related with effort and boredom/daydreaming. The results suggest that low ability students may not show maximum performance in a sequential achievement test. Thus, test score interpretation for this subsample may be invalid. As a solution to this problem the application of computerized adaptive testing is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the development of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), many new issues and challenges have been raised. For example, as the test is continuously administered, some new items should be written, calibrated, and added to the item bank periodically to replace the flawed, obsolete, and overexposed items. The new items have to be precisely calibrated because the calibration precision will directly affect the accuracy of ability estimation. The technique of online calibration has been widely used to calibrate new items on-the-fly in CAT. since it offers several advantages over the traditional offline calibration approach. As the simplest and most straightforward online calibration method, Method A (Stocking, 1988) has an obvious theoretical limitation in that it treats the estimated abilities as true values and ignores the measurement errors in ability estimation. To overcome this weakness, we combined a full functional maximum likelihood estimator (FFMLE) and an estimator which made use of the consequences of sufficiency (ECSE) (Stefanski & Carroll, 1985) with Method A respectively to correct for the estimation error of ability, and the new methods are referred to as FFMLE-Method A and ECSE-Method A. A simulation study was conducted to compare the two new methods with three other methods: the original Method A [denoted as Method A (Original)], the original Method A which plugs in the true abilities of examinees [Method A (True)]. and the 'multiple EM cycles' method (MEM). These five methods were evaluated in terms of item-parameter recovery and calibration efficiency under three levels of sample sizes (1000, 2000 and 3000) and three levels of CAT test lengths (10. 20 and 30). assuming the new items are randomly assigned to examinees. Under the two-parameter logistic model, the true abilities for the three groups of examinees were randomly drawn from the standard normal distribution [A'^ (0,1)]. For all conditions. 1000 operational items were simulated to constitute the CAT item bank in which the item parameter vector were randomly generated from a multivariate normal distribution MVN (u. S) following the procedures of Chen and Xin (2014). Furthermore, the process of simulating and calibrating new items were replicated 100 times, and 20 new items were generated and the simulation method was the same as that of the operational items. Maximum Fisher Information method was employed to select the following items, and EAP method combined with MLE method was used to estimate the examinees' abilities. Fixed-length rule was utilized to stop the CAT test. The results showed that the two new approaches, FFMLE-Method A and ECSE-Method A, improved the calibration precision over the Method A (Original) in almost all conditions, and the magnitude of improvement reached maximum when the test length was small (e.g., 10). Furthermore, the performance of the two new methods was very close to that of the best-performing MEM for small and medium-sized test length (i.e.. 10 and 20), whereas ECSE-Method A had the best performance among all methods when the test length was relatively longer (i.e., 30). Also, larger sample size resulted in more precise item-parameter recovery for all online calibration methods. Though the simulation results are very promising, several future directions for research, such as variable-length CAT and more complex CAT conditions, merit investigation (e.g., including item exposure control, content balancing and allowing item review, etc.).

AB  - There are many item selection methods proposed for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) applications. However, not all of them have been used in computerized multistage testing (ca-MST). This study uses some item selection methods as a routing method in ca-MST framework. These are maximum Fisher information (MFI), maximum likelihood weighted information (MLWI), maximum posterior weighted information (MPWI), Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler (KL), and posterior Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler (KLP). The main purpose of this study is to examine the performance of these methods when they are used as a routing method in ca-MST applications. These five information methods under four ca-MST panel designs and two test lengths (30 items and 60 items) were tested using the parameters of a real item bank. Results were evaluated with overall findings (mean bias, root mean square error, correlation between true and estimated thetas, and module exposure rates) and conditional findings (conditional absolute bias, standard error of measurement, and root mean square error). It was found that test length affected the outcomes much more than other study conditions. Under 30-item conditions, 1-3 designs outperformed other panel designs. Under 60-item conditions, 1-3-3 designs were better than other panel designs. Each routing method performed well under particular conditions; there was no clear best method in the studied conditions. The recommendations for routing methods in any particular condition were provided for researchers and practitioners as well as the limitations of these results.

AB  - Within the framework of item response theory (IRT), the authors developed a German version of an item bank, as well as a software application that can be employed to measure anxiety by means of a computer adaptive test (CAT). A sample of n = 2348 psychiatric and psychosomatic patients answered a set of up to 13 standardized questionnaires. 81 items drawn from these questionnaires were considered pertinent to the anxiety construct. Various tests were conducted to ensure the suitability of these items for an IRT-based assessment. After these tests, 50 items remained in the item bank and were calibrated using the generalized partial credit model. Simulation studies conducted on an independent sample of n = 1528 respondents indicate that 6-8 items suffice to measure the latent trait with high precision (standard error &lt;= 0.32). CAT scores correlated highly with scores estimated from all available items (r = .97) and scale scores of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, state scale, r = .93). Within a routine clinical setting, 102 inpatients answered the Anxiety-CAT along with a number of established anxiety questionnaires. The correlation between the Anxiety-CAT and the STAI state scale was still high (r = .60), but lower than the correlations found in the simulation studies. The Anxiety-CAT was able to differentiate between mental health disorders in a similar manner as established questionnaires. The results suggest that the Anxiety-CAT does indeed exhibit the advantages expected from theory, but the results of further studies are needed in order to judge its full potential for research and clinical practice.

AB  - Item banks are typically constructed from responses to items that are presented in one fixed order; therefore, order effects between subsequent items may violate the independence assumption. We investigated the effect of item order on item bank construction, item calibration, and ability estimation. 15 polytomous items similar to items used in a pilot version of a computer adaptive test for anxiety (Walter et al., 2005; Walter et al., 2007) were presented in one fixed order or in a order randomly generated for each respondent. A total of n=520 out-patients participated in the study. Item calibration (Generalized Partial Credit Model) yielded only small differences of slope and location parameters. Simulated test runs using either the full item bank or an adaptive algorithm produced very similar ability estimates (expected a posteriori estimation). These results indicate that item order had little impact on item calibration and ability estimation for this item set.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of care is increasingly assessed and incentivized using measures of patient-reported outcomes and experience. Little is known about the association between measurement of clinician communication strategies by trained observers and patient-rated clinician empathy (a patient-reported experience measure). An effective independent measure could help identify and promote clinician behaviors associated with good patient experience of care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the association between independently assessed clinician communication effectiveness and patient-rated clinician empathy? (2) Which factors are associated with independently assessed communication effectiveness? METHODS: One hundred twenty adult (age > 17 years) new or returning patients seeking musculoskeletal specialty care between September 2019 and January 2020 consented to video recording of their visit followed by completion of questionnaires rating their perceptions of providers' empathy levels in this prospective study. Patients who had operative treatment and those who had nonoperative treatment were included in our sample. We pooled new and returning patients because our prior studies of patient experience found no influence of visit type and because we were interested in the potential influences of familiarity with the clinician on empathy ratings. We did not record the number of patients or baseline data of patients who were approached, but most patients (> 80%) were willing to participate. For 7% (eight of 120 patients), there was a malfunction with the video equipment or files were misplaced, leaving 112 records available for analysis. Patients were seen by one provider among four attending physicians, four residents, or four physician assistants or nurse practitioners. The primary study question addressed the correlation between patient-rated clinician empathy using the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy and clinician communication effectiveness, independently rated by two communication scholars using the Liverpool Communication Skills Assessment Scale. Based on a subset of 68 videos (61%), the interrater reliability was considered good for individual items on the Liverpool Communication Skills Assessment Scale (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.81]) and excellent for the sum of the items (that is, the total score) (ICC = 0.92 [95% CI 0.87 to 0.95]). To account for the potential association of personal factors with empathy ratings, patients completed measures of symptoms of depression (the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System depression computerized adaptive test), self-efficacy in response to pain (the two-item Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), health anxiety (the five-item Short Health Anxiety Inventory), and basic demographics. RESULTS: Accounting for potentially confounding variables, including specific clinicians, marital status, and work status in the multivariable analysis, we found higher independent ratings of communication effectiveness had a slight association (odds ratio [OR] 1.1 [95% CI 1.0 to 1.3]; p = 0.02) with higher (dichotomized) ratings of patient-rated clinician empathy, while being single was associated with lower ratings (OR 0.40 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.99]; p = 0.05). Independent ratings of communication effectiveness were slightly higher for women (regression coefficient 1.1 [95% CI 0.05 to 2.2]); in addition, two of the four attending physicians were rated notably higher than the other 10 participants after controlling for confounding variables (differences up to 5.8 points on average [95% CI 2.6 to 8.9] on a 36-point scale). CONCLUSION: The observation that ratings of communication effectiveness by trained communication scholars have little or no association with patient-rated clinician empathy suggests that either effective communication is insufficient for good patient experience or that the existing measures are inadequate or inappropriate. This line of investigation might be enhanced by efforts to identify clinician behaviors associated with better patient experience, develop reliable and effective measures of clinician behaviors and patient experience, and use those measures to develop training approaches that improve patient experience. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, prognostic study.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is an established treatment for spastic cerebral palsy (CP). The effects and predictors of occupational therapy's benefit for self-care after SDR in children with CP have not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in self-care after occupational therapy post-SDR and determine whether changes were affected by age, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, and number of occupational therapy dressing sessions. DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected outcomes pre-SDR, at discharge, and at 1-yr follow-up. Paired t tests and regression analysis were performed. SETTING: Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities-accredited pediatric inpatient rehabilitation facility. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three children (GMFCS Levels I-III, ages 4-17 yr) diagnosed with spastic CP who underwent SDR from 2014 to 2018. INTERVENTION: After having SDR, each child received an average of twice daily occupational therapy for an average of 37.3 days. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) and Functional Independence Measure for Children(R) (WeeFIM) were used to assess self-care performance. RESULTS: The mean WeeFIM dressing (upper and lower body) and mean PEDI-CAT daily activities scores from baseline to discharge and mean WeeFIM lower body dressing at 1-yr follow-up improved significantly. The improvement in lower body dressing correlated with GMFCS level and the number of occupational therapy dressing sessions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The improvement in upper and lower extremity dressing and PEDI-CAT daily activities scores suggests that inpatient occupational therapy post-SDR may provide benefits. What This Article Adds: Children diagnosed with CP may undergo surgical interventions to improve their ability to walk. This article demonstrates the benefit of occupational therapy services after SDR to improve upper and lower body dressing skills.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) has been recommended for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study compared the content, validity and reliability of seven PROMIS CATs to the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Adult CKD patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min.1.73m2 not receiving dialysis treatment completed seven PROMIS CATs (assessing physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and ability to participate in social roles and activities), the SF-12 and, additionally, the PROMIS Pain Intensity single item and Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI) at inclusion and 2-weeks. A content comparison was performed between PROMIS CATs and SF-12. Construct validity of PROMIS CATs was assessed using Pearson's correlations. Test-retest reliability of all patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) was assessed by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC). RESULTS: In total, 207 patients participated in the study. A median of 45 items (10 minutes) was completed for PROMIS CATs. All PROMIS CATs showed evidence for sufficient construct validity. PROMIS CATs, most SF-12 domains and summary scores, and DSI showed sufficient test-retest reliability (ICC >/= 0.70). PROMIS CATs had a lower MDC compared to the SF-12 (5.7-7.4 compared to 11.2-21.7 across domains, respectively). CONCLUSION: PROMIS CATs showed sufficient construct validity and test-retest reliability in patients with advanced CKD. PROMIS CATs required more items but showed better reliability than the SF-12. Future research is needed to investigate the feasibility of PROMIS CATs for routine nephrology care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the utility of depression and anxiety symptom screening in patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty to examine differences in active symptoms according to patients' mental health diagnoses and associated prescription medications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed 594 patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty at a tertiary practice between June 2018 and December 2018. Patients completed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety Computerized Adaptive Tests in clinic quantifying active symptoms. Mental health diagnoses and associated medications were extracted from health records. Statistical analysis assessed between-group differences in mean PROMIS scores and the prevalence of heightened depressive and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression modeling demonstrated that being diagnosed with depression without medication (beta 7.1; P < .001) and with medication (beta 8.6; P < .001) were each associated with higher PROMIS Depression scores. Similar modeling demonstrated that patients diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed an anxiolytic (beta 8.4; P < .001) were associated with higher PROMIS Anxiety scores than undiagnosed patients. Eighty-six (15%) patients experienced heightened anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Heightened depressive symptoms were more prevalent among those diagnosed with depression (19% without medication, 24% with antidepressant vs 5% undiagnosed: P < .001). Heightened anxiety symptoms were most prevalent among those diagnosed with anxiety and on anxiolytic medication (25% vs 7% diagnosed with anxiety without medication, 8% undiagnosed: P < .001). CONCLUSION: One in seven arthroplasty patients screened reported heightened depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Despite the majority of arthroplasty patients on antidepressants and anxiolytics having symptoms controlled, these patients remain at increased risk of heightened active symptoms.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of glaucoma-specific quality of life (QoL) item banks (GlauCAT) and assess their performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) simulations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 293 participants with glaucoma (mean age +/- SD, 70.7 +/- 13.2 years; 45% female) answered 342 items in 12 QoL item banks (IBs): Activity Limitation (AL); Driving (DV); Convenience (CV); Economic (EC); Emotional (EM); General Symptoms (GS); Health Concerns (HC); Lighting (LT); Mobility (MB); Ocular Surface Symptoms (OS); Social (SC); and Visual Symptoms (VS). These IBs were assessed using Rasch analysis, and CAT simulations with 1000 simulated respondents were utilized to determine the average number of items to be administered to achieve moderate and high precision levels. RESULTS: The AL, DV, EM, HC, LT, MB, EC, OS, SC, and VS IBs required relatively minor amendments to achieve satisfactory psychometric fit. To resolve multidimensionality, we split CV into Treatment Convenience (TCV) and General Convenience (GCV). Due to poor measurement precision, the GS IB was not pursued further. This resulted in 12 total IBs. In CAT simulations, an average of 3.7 and 7.3 items per IB were required to attain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Following rigorous psychometric assessment, we developed 12 valid glaucoma-specific QoL domains that can obtain highly precise person measure estimates using a small number of items. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: GlauCAT will enable researchers and clinicians to quickly and comprehensively assess the impact of glaucoma and its associated interventions across a range of QoL domains.

AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in patients undergoing shoulder surgery using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety computer adaptive tests, and to determine the factors associated with more severe symptoms. Additionally, we sought to determine whether PROMIS Depression and Anxiety were associated with functional outcomes after shoulder surgery. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 293 patients from an urban population who underwent elective shoulder surgery from 2015 to 2018. Survey questionnaires included preoperative and two-year postoperative data. Bivariate analysis was used to identify associations and multivariable analysis was used to control for confounding variables. RESULTS: Mean two-year PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores significantly improved from preoperative scores, with a greater improvement observed in PROMIS Anxiety. Worse PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores were also significantly correlated with worse PROMIS Physical Function (PF) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (ASES). After controlling for confounding variables, worse PROMIS Depression was an independent predictor of worse PROMIS PF, while worse PROMIS Anxiety was an independent predictor of worse PROMIS PF and ASES scores. CONCLUSION: Mean two-year PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores improved after elective shoulder surgery and several patient characteristics were associated with these scores. Worse functional outcomes were associated with worse PROMIS Depression and Anxiety; however, more severe two-year PROMIS Anxiety was the strongest predictor of worse functional outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A crucial component to improving patient care is better clinician understanding of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In orthopaedic surgery, HRQoL assessment instruments such as the NIH developed Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), provide surgeons with a framework to assess how a treatment or medical condition is affecting each patient's HRQoL. PROMIS has been demonstrated as a valuable instrument in many diseases; however, the extent to which orthopaedic surgery subspecialties have used and validated PROMIS measures in peer-reviewed research is unclear. METHODS: Systematic scoping methodology was used to investigate the characteristics of studies using PROMIS to assess HRQoL measures as orthopaedic surgical outcomes as well as studies validating computerized adaptive test (CAT) PROMIS physical health (PH) domains including: Physical Function (PF), Upper Extremity (UE), Lower Extremity (LE). RESULTS: A systematic search of PubMed identified 391 publications utilizing PROMIS in orthopaedics; 153 (39%) were PROMIS PH CAT validation publications. One-hundred publications were in Hand and Upper Extremity, 69 in Spine, 44 in Adult Reconstruction, 43 in Foot and Ankle, 43 in Sports, 37 in Trauma, 31 in General orthopaedics, and 24 in Tumor. From 2011 through 2020 there was an upward trend in orthopaedic PROMIS publications each year (range, 1-153) and an increase in studies investigating or utilizing PROMIS PH CAT domains (range, 1-105). Eighty-five percent (n = 130) of orthopaedic surgery PROMIS PH CAT validation publications (n = 153) analyzed PF; 30% (n = 46) analyzed UE; 3% (n = 4) analyzed LE. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS utilization within orthopaedics as a whole has significantly increased within the past decade, particularly within PROMIS CAT domains. The existing literature reviewed in this scoping study demonstrates that PROMIS PH CAT domains (PF, UE, and LE) are reliable, responsive, and interpretable in most contexts of patient care throughout all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties. The expanded use of PROMIS CATs in orthopaedic surgery highlights the potential for improved quality of patient care. While challenges of integrating PROMIS into electronic medical records exist, expanded use of PROMIS CAT measurement instruments throughout orthopaedic surgery should be performed. Plain english summary In orthopaedic surgery, health-related quality of life tools such as the NIH developed Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), offer patients an opportunity to better understand their medical condition and be involved in their own care. Additionally, PROMIS provides surgeons with a framework to assess how a treatment or medical condition is affecting each patient's functional status and quality of life. The efficacy of PROMIS has been demonstrated in many diseases; however, its application throughout orthopaedic care has yet to be depicted. This study sought to identify the extent to which all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties have used and validated PROMIS measures in peer-reviewed research in order to identify its potential as an applicable and valuable tool across specialties. We determined that PROMIS utilization has significantly increased within the past decade. The existing literature reviewed in this scoping study demonstrates that the PROMIS computerized adaptive test domains evaluating physical function status are reliable, responsive, and interpretable in most contexts of patient care throughout all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties. Based on these results, this study recommends the expanded and more uniform use of PROMIS computerized adaptive test measurement instruments in the clinical care of orthopaedic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and functional decline, often leading to deterioration and dependency. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) provides opportunity to improve clinical and functional recovery, yet participation in CR decreases with age. Modified Application of CR in Older Adults (MACRO) is a National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded pragmatic trial that responds to this gap by aiming to increase enrollment of older adults into CR and improving functional outcomes. This article describes the methodology and novel features of the MACRO trial. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trial of a coaching intervention (MACRO-I) vs. usual care for older adults (age >/= 70 years) eligible for CR after an incident cardiac hospitalization. MACRO-I incorporates innovations including holistic risk assessments, flexible CR format (i.e., helping patients to select a CR design that aligns with their personal risks and preferences), motivational prompts, nutritional emphasis, facilitated deprescription, enhanced education, and home visits. Key modifications were necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including switching from a performance-based primary endpoint (Short Physical Performance Battery) to a patient-reported measure (Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Computerized Adaptive Testing). Changes prompted by COVID-19 maintain the original intent of the trial and provide key methodologic advantages. CONCLUSIONS: MACRO is exploring a novel individualized coaching intervention to better enable older patients to participate in CR. Due to COVID-19 many aspects of the MACRO protocol required modification, but the primary objective of the trial is maintained and the updated protocol will more effectively achieve the original goals of the study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measures of unhelpful thoughts and distress correlate with the intensity of pain and the magnitude of incapability among people seeking musculoskeletal specialty care. In this evolving knowledge area, we want to be sure we have not neglected other important mental health factors. This study addressed how measures of confidence in problem solving as well as past and current ability to achieve goals account for variation in symptoms and capability independent of unhelpful thoughts and distress. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are measures of confidence in problem solving ability and past and current ability to achieve goals regarding future outcomes associated with variation in capability, independent of measures of symptoms of depression and anxiety (distress) and measures of unhelpful thoughts (worst-case thinking, negative pain thoughts)? (2) Are these measures independently associated with variation in pain intensity? (3) Are these measures associated with measures of symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, and unhelpful thoughts? METHODS: Over a 7-month period during the pandemic, we enrolled sporadically from the offices of four surgeons treating patients who sought care for various upper and lower extremity conditions. We invited approximately 200 adult new and returning patients to participate (the number of invitations was not formally tracked) and 187 accepted. Thirty-one were excluded due to markedly incomplete entries (related to a problematic attempt to use the patient's cell phone to complete questionnaires as a pandemic work around), leaving 156 for analysis. Patients completed an 11-point ordinal rating of pain intensity, two measures of unhelpful thoughts (the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Negative Pain Thoughts Questionnaire), the Adult Hope Scale to measure past and current ability to achieve goals, the Personal Optimism and Self-Efficacy Optimism Scale to measure confidence in problem solving ability, the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive test to measure symptoms of anxiety, the PROMIS computer adaptive test to measure symptoms of depression, and the PROMIS physical function computer adaptive test to assess the magnitude of capability. All questionnaires were validated in previous studies. We used bivariate analyses to identify factors associated with magnitude of capability, pain intensity, confidence in problem solving ability, and past and current ability to achieve goals. All factors with a p value of less than 0.1 were included in multivariable analyses to seek associations between these measures accounting for confounders. We reported partial eta2 as a measure of effect size for all multivariable regression models. The following rules of thumb are used to interpret values for partial eta2: a value of 0.01 = small, 0.06 = medium, and values of 0.14 and higher show large effect size. RESULTS: Greater capability was modestly associated with fewer negative pain thoughts (beta = -0.63 [95% CI -1.0 to -0.22]; standard error = 0.20; partial eta2 = 0.06; p = 0.003) and no self-reported comorbidities (beta = 2.6 [95% CI 0.02 to 5.3]; standard error = 1.3; partial eta2 = 0.03; p = 0.048) after controlling for education, symptoms of depression and anxiety, worst-case thinking, as well as past and current ability to achieve goals. In a similar multivariable model, greater pain intensity was modestly associated with greater worst-case thinking (beta = 0.33 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.45]; standard error = 0.06; partial eta2 = 0.16; p < 0.001) and established patients (beta = -1.1 [95% CI -1.8 to -0.31]; standard error = 0.38; partial eta2 = 0.05; p = 0.006). In another similar multivariable model, having more confidence in problem solving ability had a limited association with higher ratings of past and current ability to achieve goals (beta = 0.15 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.21]; standard error = 0.03; partial eta2 = 0.13; p < 0.001). In a final multivariable model, lower past and current ability to achieve goals was independently associated with having greater symptoms of depression (beta = -0.45 [95% CI -0.67 to -0.23]; standard error = 0.11; partial eta2 = 0.1; p < 0.001) and more negative pain thoughts (beta = -0.49 [95% CI -0.89 to -0.09]; standard error = 0.20; partial eta2 = 0.04; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The observation that unhelpful thoughts about symptoms are more strongly associated with symptom intensity than past and current ability to achieve goals and confidence in problem solving ability add to the evidence that attentiveness to unhelpful thinking is an important aspect of musculoskeletal health. Musculoskeletal specialists can prioritize communication strategies such as relationship building and motivational interviewing that develop trust and facilitate reorientation of common unhelpful thoughts. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - Nondestructive magnetic measurement methods can be successfully applied to determine the embrittlement of nuclear pressure vessel steel caused by neutron irradiation. It was found in previous works that reasonable correlation could be obtained between the nondestructively measured magnetic parameters and destructively determined ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. However, a large scatter of the measurement points was detected even in the cases of the non-irradiated reference samples. The reason for their scattering was attributed to the local inhomogeneity of material. This conclusion is verified in the present work by applying three different magnetic methods on two sets of Charpy samples made of two different reactor steel materials. It was found that by an optimal magnetic pre-selection of samples, a good, linear correlation can be found between magnetic parameters as well as the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature with low scattering of points. This result shows that neutron irradiation embrittlement depends very much on the local material properties.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures can be administered via computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or fixed short forms (FSFs), but the empirical benefits of CAT versus FSFs are unknown in juvenile myositis (JM). The present study was undertaken to assess whether PROMIS CAT is feasible, precise, correlated with FSFs, and less prone to respondent burden and floor/ceiling effects than FSFs in JM. METHODS: Patients 8-17 years of age (self-report and parent proxy) and parents of patients 5-7 years of age (only parent proxy) completed PROMIS fatigue, pain interference, upper extremity function, mobility, anxiety, and depressive symptoms measures. Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were calculated between PROMIS CAT and FSFs. McNemar's test assessed floor/ceiling effects between CAT and FSFs. Precision and respondent burden were examined across the T score range. RESULTS: Data from 67 patient-parent dyads were analyzed. CAT and FSF mean scores did not significantly differ except in parent proxy anxiety and fatigue (effect size 0.23 and 0.19, respectively). CAT had less pronounced floor/ceiling effects at the less symptomatic extreme in all domains except self-report anxiety. Increased item burden and higher SEs were seen in less symptomatic scorers for CAT. Modified stopping rules limiting CAT item administration did not decrease precision. CONCLUSION: PROMIS CAT appears to be feasible and correlated with FSFs. CAT had less pronounced floor/ceiling effects, allowing detection of individual differences in less symptomatic patients. Modified stopping rules for CAT may decrease respondent burden. CAT can be considered for long-term follow-up of JM patients.

AB  - Pediatric burn injuries can alter the trajectory of the survivor's entire life. Patient-centered outcome measures are helpful to assess unique physical and psychosocial needs and long-term recovery. This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework to measure pediatric burn outcomes in survivors aged 5 to 12 years as a part of the School-Aged Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation Computer Adaptive Test (SA-LIBRE5-12 CAT) development. This study conducted a systematic literature review guided by the WHO International Classification of Functioning-Child and Youth and domains in the American Burn Association/Shriners Hospitals for Children Burn Outcomes Questionnaire5-18. Interviews with eight parents and seven clinicians were conducted to identify important domains in child recovery. One clinician focus group with four clinicians was completed to identify gaps in the preliminary framework, and semiweekly expert consensus meetings were conducted with three experts to solidify the framework. Qualitative data were analyzed by grounded theory methodology. Three major thematic outcome domains emerged: 1) Physical Functioning: fine motor and upper extremity, gross motor and lower extremity, pain, skin symptoms, sleep and fatigue, and physical resilience; 2) Psychological Functioning: cognitive, behavioral, emotional, resilience, and body image; and 3) Family and Social Functioning: family relationships, and parental satisfaction, school, peer relations, and community participation. The framework will be used to develop item banks for a CAT-based assessment of school-aged children's health and developmental outcomes, which will be designed for clinical and research use to optimize interventions, personalize care, and improve long-term health outcomes for burned children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research consistently documents no correlation between the duration of a musculoskeletal specialty care visit and patient experience (perceived empathy of the specialist and satisfaction with care). Based on a combination of clinical experience and other lines of research, we speculate that longer visits are often related to discordance between specialist and patient interpretation of symptoms and weighting of available test and treatment options. If this is true, then the specific duration of time discussing the specialist's interpretations and options with the patient (expertise transfer) might correlate with satisfaction with care and perceived empathy of the clinician even if the total visit time does not. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What demographic or mental health factors are associated with the duration of expertise transfer? (2) What factors, including the duration of expertise transfer, are associated with the patient's satisfaction with the visit and perceived clinician empathy? METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 128 new and returning English-speaking adult outpatients seeking care from one of three orthopaedic specialists in two urban practices between September and November 2019 were enrolled and agreed to audio recording of the visit. A total of 92% (118) of patients completed the questionnaire and had a usable recording. Participants completed a sociodemographic survey, the Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System Depression computer adaptive test (PROMIS Depression CAT; a measure of symptoms of depression), the Short Health Anxiety Index (SHAI-5; a measure of symptoms of hypochondriasis, a form of symptoms misinterpretation), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4; a measure of misinterpretation of symptoms), an ordinal measure of patient satisfaction (dichotomized into satisfied or not because of strong ceiling effects), and the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perception of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE; a measure of perceived clinician empathy). The duration of expertise transfer and the total duration of the visit were measured by two raters with acceptable reliability using software that facilitates segmentation of the visit audio recording. To determine factors associated with the duration of expertise transfer, satisfaction, and empathy, we planned a multivariable analysis controlling for potential confounding variables identified in exploratory bivariable analysis. However, there were insufficient associations to merit multivariable analysis. RESULTS: A longer duration of expertise transfer had a modest correlation with catastrophic thinking (r = 0.24; p = 0.01). Complete satisfaction with the visit was associated with less health anxiety (6 [interquartile range 5 to 7] for complete satisfaction versus 7 [5 to 7] for less than complete satisfaction; p = 0.02) and catastrophic thinking (4 [1 to 7] versus 5 [3 to 11]; p = 0.02), but not with the duration of expertise transfer. Greater perceived clinician empathy had a slight correlation with less health anxiety (r = -0.19; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with greater misinterpretation of symptoms experience a slightly less satisfying visit and less empathetic relationship with a musculoskeletal specialist despite a longer duration of expertise transfer. This supports the concept that directive strategies (such as teaching healthy interpretation of symptoms) may be less effective then guiding strategies (such as nurturing openness to alternative, healthier interpretation of symptoms using motivational interviewing tactics, often over more than one visit or point of contact). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

AB  - The Infant Toddler Activity Card Sort (ITACS) is a new measure that engages caregivers in goal development by measuring participation in early childhood. Initial evaluation of the ITACS is required to assess its psychometric properties. To evaluate test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and between-group differences of the ITACS. Caregivers (N = 208) of children 0-3 years, who were typically developing (TD) or had a developmental delay (DD), completed the ITACS and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) with repeat assessment after 2 weeks later (n = 117). The ITACS demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with the PEDI-CAT. Children with DD had significantly more activity concerns on the ITACS than TD. Adequate test-retest reliability was not achieved. The ITACS is a useful tool for identifying caregiver concerns in activity engagement; interventions can be tailored to address concerns and increase participation in childhood routines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) and the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version of the EORTC quality-of-life questionnaire QLQ-C30 have been proposed as new PRO measures in oncology; however, their implementation in patients undergoing cancer surgery has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective abdominal cancer surgery were enrolled in a prospective multicenter study, and postoperative complications were recorded according to the Dindo-Clavien classification. Patients reported PRO data using the CAT EORTC QLQ-C30 and the PRO-CTCAE to measure 12 core cancer symptoms. Patients were followed-up for 6 months postoperatively. The study was carried out by medical students of the CHIR-Net SIGMA study network. RESULTS: Data of 303 patients were obtained and analyzed across 15 sites. PRO-CTCAE symptoms 'poor appetite', 'fatigue', 'exhaustion' and 'sleeping problems' increased after surgery and climaxed 10-30 days postoperatively. At 3-6 months postoperatively, no PRO-CTCAE symptom differed significantly to baseline. Patients reported higher 'social functioning' (p = 0.021) and overall quality-of-life scores (p < 0.05) 6 months after cancer surgery compared with the baseline level. There was a lack of correlation between postoperative complications or death and any of the PRO items evaluated. Feasibility endpoints for student-led research were met. CONCLUSION: The two novel PRO questionnaires were successfully applied in surgical oncology. Postoperative complications do not affect health-reported quality-of-life or common cancer symptoms following major cancer surgery. The feasibility of student-led multicenter clinical research was demonstrated, but might be enhanced by improved student training.

AB  - AIMS: The increase in prescription opioid misuse and dependence is now a public health crisis in the UK. It is recognized as a whole-person problem that involves both the medical and the psychosocial needs of patients. Analyzing aspects of pathophysiology, emotional health, and social wellbeing associated with persistent opioid use after injury may inform safe and effective alleviation of pain while minimizing risk of misuse or dependence. Our objectives were to investigate patient factors associated with opioid use two to four weeks and six to nine months after an upper limb fracture. METHODS: A total of 734 patients recovering from an isolated upper limb fracture were recruited in this study. Opioid prescription was documented retrospectively for the period preceding the injury, and prospectively at the two- to four-week post-injury visit and six- to nine-month post-injury visit. Bivariate and multivariate analysis sought factors associated with opioid prescription from demographics, injury-specific data, Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Instrumentation System (PROMIS), Depression computer adaptive test (CAT), PROMIS Anxiety CAT, PROMIS Instrumental Support CAT, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ-2), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11), and measures that investigate levels of social support. RESULTS: A new prescription of opioids two to four weeks after injury was independently associated with less social support (odds ratio (OR) 0.26, p < 0.001), less instrumental support (OR 0.91, p < 0.001), and greater symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.1, p < 0.001). A new prescription of opioids six to nine months after injury was independently associated with less instrumental support (OR 0.9, p < 0.001) and greater symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that potentially modifiable psychosocial factors are associated with increased acute and chronic opioid prescriptions following upper limb fracture.

AB  - PURPOSE: This exploratory qualitative research was conducted to understand the quality of life (QoL) impacts of adult uveitis to develop a uveitis QoL item bank, and we present here the results of qualitative analysis of uveitis patient experience.METHODS: A qualitative approach with phenomenological study design was employed to explore the common QoL domains in uveitis. Data were collected using focus groups and face-to-face interviews. The sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically. NViVo software was used to perform qualitative analysis.RESULTS: Eight focus groups and 10 interviews were conducted with 41 patients with uveitis. Seven QoL domains were identified, namely symptoms, emotional, activity limitation, health concerns, convenience, social, and economic impact. Although these QoL domains have been previously identified in other eye diseases, the sub-themes within each QoL domain were unique to uveitis. Participants described a variety of symptoms including increased light sensitivity, blurred vision, pain, redness, and tearing. Participants repeatedly described feeling frustrated due to prognostic uncertainty and associated discomfort. Participants were concerned about the frequent relapses of inflammation, as well as side-effects from long-term systemic medications. Uveitis affected their ability to perform daily tasks such as using computers, driving, and reading books. Direct financial impacts included reduced work hours and the costs of treatment and specialist care.CONCLUSION: Participants with uveitis experience many symptoms in addition to medication-related inconveniences and activity limitations. The QoL issues identified will be used to develop a uveitis-specific QoL item bank.

AB  - A central but challenging problem in genetic studies is to test for (usually weak) associations between a complex trait (e.g., a disease status) and sets of multiple genetic variants. Due to the lack of a uniformly most powerful test, data-adaptive tests, such as the adaptive sum of powered score (aSPU) test, are advantageous in maintaining high power against a wide range of alternatives. However, there is often no closed-form to accurately and analytically calculate the p-values of many adaptive tests like aSPU, thus Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are often used, which can be time consuming to achieve a stringent significance level (e.g., 5e-8) used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To estimate such a small p-value, we need a huge number of MC simulations (e.g., 1e+10). As an alternative, we propose using importance sampling to speed up such calculations. We develop some theory to motivate a proposed algorithm for the aSPU test, and show that the proposed method is computationally more efficient than the standard MC simulations. Using both simulated and real data, we demonstrate the superior performance of the new method over the standard MC simulations.

AB  - An adaptive task difficulty assignment method which we reckon as balanced difficulty task finder (BDTF) is proposed in this paper. The aim is to recommend tasks to a learner using a trade-off between skills of the learner and difficulty of the tasks such that the learner experiences a state of flow during the learning. Flow is a mental state that psychologists refer to when someone is completely immersed in an activity. Flow state is a multidisciplinary field of research and has been studied not only in psychology, but also neuroscience, education, sport, and games. The idea behind this paper is to try to achieve a flow state in a similar way as Elo's chess skill rating (Glickman in Am Chess J 3:59-102) and TrueSkill (Herbrich et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems, 2006) for matching game players, where "matched players" should possess similar capabilities and skills in order to maintain the level of motivation and involvement in the game. The BDTF draws analogy between choosing an appropriate opponent or appropriate game level and automatically choosing an appropriate difficulty level of a learning task. This method, as an intelligent tutoring system, could be used in a wide range of applications from online learning environments and e-learning, to learning and remembering techniques in traditional methods such as adjusting delayed matching to sample and spaced retrieval training that can be used for people with memory problems such as people with dementia.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Comparative cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in children and adolescents with varying extent of spinal deformity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several PROMs have been proposed to help assess health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in pediatric spinal deformity surgery and research, but it is unclear which are sensitive to deformity severity. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with spinal asymmetry or juvenile/adolescent idiopathic scoliosis completed the patient-reported outcomes management information system (PROMIS) pediatric computer adaptive test bank (Domains: Mobility, Pain Interference, Physical Activity, Physical Stress Experiences, Psychological Stress Experiences), Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r), Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS Pedi-FABS) activity scale, and Trunk Appearance Perception Scale. Patients were grouped as spinal asymmetry, mild deformity, and substantial deformity by major Cobb angle measuring less than 10 degrees , between 10 degrees  and 40 degrees , and greater than 40 degrees  respectively. One-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post-hoc correction was used to determine score differences between groups. RESULTS: Final analyses included 206 patients, of which 135 (66%) were female. The mean age was 13.0 +/- 2.2 years, and the mean major Cobb angle was 20.1 +/- 14.1 degrees  (range: 0-74.2 degrees ). Compared with both spinal asymmetry and mild deformity patients, patients with substantial deformity reported worse outcomes, including lower function, more pain, and decreased psychological health by legacy PROMs and PROMIS. PROMIS Physical Activity and Psychological Stress Experiences did not capture any significant differences between all groups. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the spinal asymmetry and mild deformity groups for all PROMs measured. CONCLUSION: Patients with substantial spinal deformity reported lower activity and function, more pain, and greater physical and psychological stress compared with patients without clinical spinal deformity by legacy PROMs and several PROMIS domains. As PROMIS Physical Activity and Psychological Stress Experiences did not capture these differences, these PROMs may measure different constructs than the legacy PROMs as they relate to spinal curvature and may be less relevant to measure HRQoL in this population.Level of Evidence 3.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective correlational study was to compare the psychometric properties of the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales with those of traditional legacy scales over a longitudinal postoperative period in patients undergoing arthroscopic procedures. METHODS: Active-duty military personnel undergoing shoulder and knee arthroscopic procedures completed the DVPRS, PROMIS, and legacy scales preoperatively and again at 3 months postoperatively. Rolling correlation coefficients (r(rm)) were used to assess the concurrent validity between the DVPRS average pain scores and computer adaptive testing PROMIS scales (Anxiety, Depression, Pain Behavior, Pain Interference, Mobility, Sleep Disturbance, Satisfaction With Social Roles, and Upper Extremity Physical Function) and the legacy scales (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] scale, Shoulder Activity Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] questionnaire, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation [SANE], Marx Activity Rating Scale, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey). RESULTS: A total of 121 participants completed the scales preoperatively, 80 completed them at 3 months postoperatively, and 59 (49% of participants) completed them at both times. Rolling correlation coefficients between PROMIS Pain Interference (r(rm) = -0.41, P = .006), Satisfaction With Social Roles (r(rm) = 0.56, P < .001), and Upper Extremity (r(rm) = 0.71, P < .001) scores showed acceptable concurrent validity with ASES scores over a longitudinal postoperative period. DVPRS scores (r(rm) = -0.69, P = .002) and PROMIS Pain Behavior (r(rm) = -0.57, P = .018), Pain Interference (r(rm) = -0.71, P = .001), Sleep Disturbance (r(rm) = -0.64, P = .005), and Mobility (r(rm) = 0.65, P = .005) scores showed acceptable concurrent validity with IKDC scores. There was poor correlation between the PROMIS and DVPRS scores and the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Marx Activity Rating Scale, Shoulder Activity Scale, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey scores. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS scales measuring physical function, pain presentation, and other health domains showed acceptable concurrent validity with ASES and IKDC scores. By integrating the prospective collection of biopsychosocial PROMIS scales into practice, it is possible for clinicians in orthopaedic settings to assess changes in validated patient-reported outcomes to inform patient-centered care planning throughout the postoperative recovery period. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective comparative study (with not all participants completing follow-up).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood brain tumors experience persistent health concerns across their lifespan. In the current study, the authors evaluated changes in symptom burden over the course of 12 months using pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. METHODS: Data from 202 survivors aged 8 to 21 years and 262 parents of survivors who were aged 5 to 21 years were analyzed. All completed a PROMIS Cognition short form and computerized adaptive tests of pediatric Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity Function, and Peer Relationships. Approximately one-half of participants (223 participants: 97 survivors of childhood brain tumors and 126 parents) completed the 12-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated group-level symptoms over time. Cox proportional hazard models explored whether symptoms predicted survival, and latent class growth analysis investigated patterns of individual-level symptom changes over time. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that patient-reported Cognition and parent-reported Anxiety worsened over time. Latent class growth analysis results indicated that patient and parent reports diverged, both with regard to the number of classes identified and in the trends of these classes. Parents and patients reported similar patterns of depression over time. For the other areas, parents either were more likely to observe different patterns (Peer Relationships and Mobility) or less likely to observe different patterns (Upper Extremity Function, Cognition, Anxiety, and Fatigue). Baseline patient-reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were found to be associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood brain tumors demonstrated different trajectory patterns of symptom burden. Along with baseline functioning status and days since treatment, patient-reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were associated with survival, suggesting a possible role for patient-reported outcomes in clinical care, especially individualized, tailored assessments such as PROMIS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Questionnaires to detect emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) in Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH) should be short which potentially affects validity and reliability. Simulation studies have shown that Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) could overcome these weaknesses. We studied the applicability (using the measures participation rate, satisfaction, and efficiency) and the validity of CAT in routine PCH practice. METHODS: We analyzed data on 461 children aged 10-11 years (response 41%), who were assessed during routine well-child examinations by PCH professionals. Before the visit, parents completed the CAT and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Satisfaction was measured by parent- and PCH professional-report. Efficiency of the CAT procedure was measured as number of items needed to assess whether a child has serious problems or not. Its validity was assessed using the CBCL as the criterion. RESULTS: Parents and PCH professionals rated the CAT on average as good. The procedure required at average 16 items to assess whether a child has serious problems or not. Agreement of scores on the CAT scales with corresponding CBCL scales was high (range of Spearman correlations 0.59-0.72). Area Under Curves (AUC) were high (range: 0.95-0.97) for the Psycat total, externalizing, and hyperactivity scales using corresponding CBCL scale scores as criterion. For the Psycat internalizing scale the AUC was somewhat lower but still high (0.86). CONCLUSIONS: CAT is a valid procedure for the identification of emotional and behavioral problems in children aged 10-11 years. It may support the efficient and accurate identification of children with overall, and potentially also specific, emotional and behavioral problems in routine PCH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Outcome measures typically used to evaluate disease modifying therapies (DMTs) provide important information regarding their effects on disease activity, but they do not capture the full impact of living with multiple sclerosis (MS). Patient reported outcome measures (PROs) are increasingly being used to capture an individual's subjective experience of disease. We compared DMTs across a wide range of PRO outcomes in individuals with MS. METHODS: Subjects enrolled in SysteMS completed the computer adaptive testing version of the Neuro-QoL within four weeks of a clinical neurological exam. Neuro-QoL measures included the following 11 health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains: Ability to participate in Social Roles and Activities, Anxiety, Cognitive Function, Depression, Emotional and Behavioral Dyscontrol, Fatigue, Lower Extremity Function (mobility), Positive Affect and Wellbeing, Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities, Stigma, and Upper Extremity Function (fine motor). Treatments were grouped based on the three main modes of delivery: injectable, oral and infusion. The three treatment groups were compared using linear regression adjusting for two sets of covariates (set 1: age, sex, disease duration and EDSS; set 2: age, sex, disease duration, EDSS and treatment duration). We also compared the individual treatments using linear regression. RESULTS: After adjusting for the first set of clinical and demographic features of MS, there was a difference between treatment groups for Upper Extremity Function and Stigma. Subjects using injectable treatments reported better functioning in terms of Upper Extremity Function and Stigma than subjects using infusion treatments. In addition, subjects using injectable treatments reported better Upper Extremity Function than subjects treated with oral DMTs. When all individual treatments were compared, interferon-treated subjects reported significantly better functioning in terms of Stigma than natalizumab treated subjects. When further adjusting for time on treatment, the group differences were attenuated and no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We examined differences between MS treatment groups across a wide range of HRQOL outcomes. The results suggest that overall there are few differences between treatments on the physical, cognitive and emotional dimensions of well-being.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish preoperative validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function computer adaptive test (PROMIS PF-CT) with legacy patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for meniscal root tears (MRTs). Our study included 51 patients (52 knees) with MRT. Patients completed PROMIS PF-CT, Short Form 36 (SF-36 physical function, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional well-being, role limitations due to physical health, and role limitations due to emotional problems), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS pain, symptoms, activities of daily living [ADLs], sports, and quality of life [QOL]), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC pain, stiffness, and function), EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), and Knee Activity Scale questionnaires at their preoperative visit. Correlations between the PROMs listed above were evaluated along with floor and ceiling effects. Correlations were defined as weak (0.2-0.39), moderate (0.4-0.59), strong (0.6-0.79), and very strong (0.8-1.0). Preoperative data showed that PROMIS PF-CT has a strong correlation with SF-36 PF, KOOS-ADL, WOMAC-function, and EQ-5D; and moderate correlation with KOOS-sport, KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-QOL, WOMAC-pain, and WOMAC-stiffness. The Knee Activity Scale did not show any significant correlation with PROMIS PF-CT (r = 0.12, p = 0.2080). Of all the PROMs administered, PROMIS PF-CT demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects compared with 11.54% ceiling effect in KOOS-sports, and 5.77% floor effect in KOOS-ADL. On average, patients answered fewer PROMIS PF-CT questions (4.15 +/- 0.72). PROMIS PF-CT is a valuable tool to assess preoperative patient-reported physical function in patients that may undergo MRT repair. It correlates strongly with other well-established PROMs. It also demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects and demonstrated a low test burden in our sample of 52 knees. This is a level III, prognostic retrospective comparative study.

AB  - There is limited validated data regarding the relationship between preoperative expectations and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients undergoing knee surgery. The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the preoperative expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery and (2) determine the relationship between preoperative patient demographics, PROs, and preoperative patient expectations. We hypothesized that younger patients with worse function and worse general health status would have greater expectations of knee surgery. We analyzed data from 399 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic medical center. We utilized the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System to measure preoperative expectations. Multiple legacy PRO measures were recorded, as well as the new Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) Computer Adaptive Testing. Nonparametric statistical analyses were performed to determine significance. Overall, patients undergoing knee surgery had high expectations, with a mean of 88.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 86.7-89.3) and median of 91.7 (95% CI, 89.2-94.3). Greater preoperative expectations of knee surgery were associated with higher income, surgically naive knee, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, better PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores, greater Marx knee activity scores, and lower total body pain (p < 0.05). Preoperative expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery are associated with a history of prior knee surgery, income, general and mental health, activity, and pain. Expectations were also found to be associated with PRO measures of function and psychological well-being. These findings may have implications for patient education and shared decision-making preoperatively. The level of evidence for the study is IV.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Liver transplantation candidates are among the most comorbid patients awaiting lifesaving intervention. Health related quality of life (HRQOL) measured by instruments that incorporate dynamic computerized adaptive testing, could improve their assessment. We aimed to determine the feasibility of administration of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-CAT) in liver transplant candidates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver transplantation candidates were prospectively enrolled following a review of their available medical history. Subjects were given a tablet computer (iPad) to access the pre-loaded PROMIS CAT. RESULTS: 109 candidates with mean age 55.6+/-8.6 years were enrolled in this pilot study. Mean MELD-Na score was 16.3+/-6.3; 92.6% had decompensated liver disease. Leading etiologies of cirrhosis included hepatitis C (34.8%), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (25.7%) and alcohol (21.1%). Subjects with MELD-Na score>20 had the most significant impairment in HRQOL (anxiety/fear+5.9+/-2.7, p=0.0289, depression+5.1+/-2.5, p=0.0428, fatigue+4.3+/-2.6, p=0.0973) and physical impairment (-7.8+/-2.5, p=0.0022). Stage of cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease were predictive of impaired HRQOL but Child-Pugh Turcotte score was not. Hepatic encephalopathy was the strongest independent predictor of impaired HRQOL, with significant impairment across all domains of health. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant candidates have significantly impaired HRQOL across multiple domains of health as measured by PROMIS-CAT. HRQOL impairment parallels disease severity. Future study is needed to determine how best HRQOL could be systematically included in liver transplantation listing policy, especially in those candidates with hepatic encephalopathy.

AB  - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are a measure of health care quality that reflect the patient's perceptions of their own health status. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in implementation of PROs into everyday clinical practice. There are many dozens of PROs available to foot and ankle surgeons with little consensus on which measures are most appropriate for a given condition. These measures vary widely in length, validity, and content. When integrating PROs into clinical practice, we recommend that clinicians should collect, at a minimum, validated PRO scores that assess pain, function, and general health. Furthermore, concise instruments should be used wherever possible to minimize patient burden, maximize patient engagement, and ensure meaningful data are collected. In the near future, outcomes registries employing computer adaptive testing will facilitate the routine collection of PRO data from all patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, expert opinion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A large body of research shows that psychologic distress and ineffective coping strategies substantially contribute to more severe pain and increased physical limitations among patients with orthopaedic disorders. However, little is known about the relationship between positive psychology (constructs that enable individuals to thrive and adapt to challenges) and pain and physical limitations in this population. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which positive-psychology factors (satisfaction with life, gratitude, coping through humor, resilience, mindfulness, and optimism) are independently associated with fewer upper-extremity physical limitations after controlling for the other clinical and demographic variables? (2) Which positive-psychology factors are independently associated with pain intensity after controlling for relevant clinical and demographic variables? METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we recruited patients presenting for a scheduled appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon at a hand and upper-extremity clinic of a major urban academic medical center. Of 125 approached patients, 119 (44% men; mean age, 50 +/- 17 years) met screening criteria and agreed to participate. Patients completed a clinical and demographic questionnaire, the Numerical Rating Scale to assess pain intensity, the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Physical Function computerized adaptive test to assess physical limitations, and six measures assessing positive-psychology constructs: The Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Gratitude Questionnaire, the Coping Humor Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised, and the Life Orientation Test-Revised. We first examined bivariate associations among physical limitations, pain intensity, and all positive-psychology factors as well as demographic and clinical variables. All variables that demonstrated associations with physical limitations or pain intensity at p < 0.05 were included in two-stage multivariable hierarchical regression models. RESULTS: After controlling for the potentially confounding effects of prior surgical treatment and duration since pain onset (step1; R total = 0.306; F[7,103] = 6.50), the positive-psychology variables together explained an additional 15% (R change = 0.145, F change [5, 103] = 4.297, p = 0.001) of the variance in physical limitations. Among the positive-psychology variables tested, mindfulness was the only one associated with fewer physical limitations (beta = 0.228, t = 2.293, p = 0.024, 4% variance explained). No confounding demographic or clinical variables were found for pain intensity in bivariate analyses. All positive-psychology variables together explained 23% of the variance in pain intensity (R = 0.23; F[5,106] = 6.38, p < 0.001). Among the positive-psychology variables, satisfaction with life was the sole factor independently associated with higher intensity (beta = -0.237, t = -2.16, p = 0.033, 3% variance explained). CONCLUSIONS: Positive-psychology variables explained 15% of the variance in physical limitations and for 23% of the variance in pain intensity among patients with heterogenous upper extremity disorders within a hand and upper extremity practice. Of all positive-psychology factors, mindfulness and satisfaction with life were most important for physical limitations and pain intensity, respectively. As positive-psychology factors are more easily modifiable through skills-based interventions than pain and physical limitations, results suggest implementation of such interventions to potentially improve outcomes in this population. Skills-based interventions targeting mindfulness and satisfaction with life may be of particular benefit. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computer-adaptive tests (CAT) use individualised sets of questions to assess patient-reported health states, whereas static (conventional) questionnaires present the same questions to all patients. CAT has been shown to increase measurement precision and reduce assessment length. In our study, we investigated if patients perceive CAT questions as more appropriate than static questionnaires, a claim that is frequently associated with CAT measures. METHODS: We compared the static European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) against its corresponding CAT measures focusing on two domains: Physical Functioning (PF) and Emotional Functioning (EF). Cancer patients completed the questionnaires and participated in a cognitive interview to assess how appropriate they perceive the QLQ-C30 and the CAT questions for their current health state. RESULTS: Forty-four cancer patients (mean age = 54.6; 56.8% female) were assessed. For the PF domain, patients considered the CAT items more appropriate (p = 0.002) than the QLQ-C30 items (56.8% vs. 15.9%; 27.2% indifferent). For the EF domain, patients were in favour of the QLQ-C30 items (p < 0.001), with 54.5% considering the QLQ-C30, and 4.5% considering the CAT items to be more appropriate; 40.9% were indifferent. Most patients (N = 36) commented on the preference for the CAT (PF), mentioning better matching of the questions and the health state (38.6%) and better item wording (15.9%). CONCLUSION: For the PF domain the CAT measure better matched the score distribution in the patient sample than the QLQ-C30 PF scale and was consequently considered more appropriate by patients. For the EF domain, the CAT measure did not show better fit than the QLQ-C30 and hence no such preference in terms of appropriateness was observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent discoveries in the fields of machine learning (ML), Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), digital phenotype, imaging, and biomarkers have brought about a new paradigm shift in medicine. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore psychiatrists' perspectives on this paradigm through the prism of new clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). Our primary objective was to assess the acceptability of these new technologies. Our secondary objective was to characterize the factors affecting their acceptability. METHODS: A sample of psychiatrists was recruited through a mailing list. Respondents completed a Web-based survey. A quantitative study with an original form of assessment involving the screenplay method was implemented involving 3 scenarios, each featuring 1 of the 3 support systems, namely, EMA and CAT, biosensors comprising a connected wristband-based digital phenotype, and an ML-based blood test or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated 4 acceptability domains based on International Organization for Standardization and Nielsen models (usefulness, usability, reliability, and risk). RESULTS: We recorded 515 observations. Regarding our primary objective, overall acceptability was moderate. MRI coupled with ML was considered to be the most useful system, and the connected wristband was considered the least. All the systems were described as risky (410/515, 79.6%). Regarding our secondary objective, acceptability was strongly influenced by socioepidemiological variables (professional culture), such as gender, age, and theoretical approach. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess psychiatrists' views on new CDSSs. Data revealed moderate acceptability, but our analysis shows that this is more the result of the lack of knowledge about these new technologies rather than a strong rejection. Furthermore, we found strong correspondences between acceptability profiles and professional culture profiles. Many medical, forensics, and ethical issues were raised, including therapeutic relationship, data security, data storage, and privacy risk. It is essential for psychiatrists to receive training and become involved in the development of new technologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most important aspects of designing a clinical trial is selecting appropriate outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can provide a personal assessment of the burden and impact of a malignant disease and its treatment. PROs comprise a wide range of outcomes including basic clinical symptom scores and complex metrics such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There is limited data on how postoperative complications following cancer surgery affect symptoms and HRQoL. For this reason the primary aim of the PATRONUS study is to investigate how perioperative complications affect cancer-related symptoms and HRQoL in patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery. The PATRONUS study is designed and will be initiated and conducted by medical students under the direct supervision of clinician scientists based on the concept of inquiry-based learning. METHODS: PATRONUS is a non-interventional prospective multicentre cohort study. Patients undergoing elective oncological abdominal surgery will be recruited at regional centres of the clinical network of the German Surgical Society (CHIR-Net) and associated hospitals. A core set of 12 cancer associated symptoms will be assessed via the PRO version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The cancer-specific HRQoL will be measured via the computerised adaptive testing version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. PROs will be measured eight times over a period of six months. The short-term clinical outcome measure is the rate of postoperative complications (grade II to V) within 30 days according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The long-term clinical outcome is overall survival within six months postoperative. DISCUSSION: PATRONUS will provide essential insights into the patients' assessment of their well-being and quality of life in direct relation to clinical outcome parameters following abdominal cancer surgery. Furthermore, PATRONUS will investigate the feasibility of multicentre student-led clinical research.

AB  - A cross-sectional analysis of data derived from patients undergoing knee surgery at a single institution was conducted. The objectives of the study were to determine the demographic, diagnostic, and psychologic factors associated with opioid use; and to determine the clinical correlates of opioid use. We hypothesized that preoperative opioid use would be associated with worse patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. The sample consisted of 383 patients undergoing knee surgery. The patients were classified as either opioid or nonopioid users on the basis of medical record review. All participants completed a battery of clinical assessments, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive testing in six domains: Physical Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Social Satisfaction, Anxiety, and Depression. Analyses were conducted to examine clinical variables as a function of opioid use. The results indicated that opioid use was associated with female gender, unemployment, smoking, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, greater number of previous surgeries, depression or anxiety, and worse expectation of surgery (p < 0.05). Multivariable analysis found opioid use to be a significant independent predictor of multiple PRO measures in patients undergoing knee surgery. Potential explanations for these findings are presented, and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Surgery for nontraumatic upper-extremity problems is largely discretionary and preference-sensitive. Psychological and social determinants of health correlate with greater symptoms and limitations and might be associated with discretionary operative treatment. METHODS: We used routinely collected patient-reported outcome measures from patients with de Quervain tendinopathy, ganglion cyst, trapeziometacarpal arthritis, trigger digit, and carpal tunnel syndrome to study factors associated with discretionary surgery using multiple logistic regression. Patients completed a measure of the magnitude of physical limitations (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Test [CAT]), a measure of the degree to which a person limits activities owing to pain (PROMIS Pain Interference CAT), and a measure of symptoms of depression (PROMIS Depression CAT) at every office visit. RESULTS: Higher PROMIS Pain Interference score, diagnoses of carpal tunnel syndrome, and treatment by teams 3, 4, or 5 were independently associated with discretionary operative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: People with a greater tendency to limit activity owing to pain are more likely to choose discretionary surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interventions that help people remain active despite pain by addressing the psychological and social determinants of health might affect the rate of discretionary surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our understanding of the coping strategies used by people with visual impairment to manage stress related to visual loss is limited. This study aims to develop a sophisticated coping instrument in the form of an item bank implemented via Computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for hereditary retinal diseases. METHODS: Items on coping were extracted from qualitative interviews with patients which were supplemented by items from a literature review. A systematic multi-stage process of item refinement was carried out followed by expert panel discussion and cognitive interviews. The final coping item bank had 30 items. Rasch analysis was used to assess the psychometric properties. A CAT simulation was carried out to estimate an average number of items required to gain precise measurement of hereditary retinal disease-related coping. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine participants answered the coping item bank (median age = 58 years). The coping scale demonstrated good precision and targeting. The standardised residual loadings for items revealed six items grouped together. Removal of the six items reduced the precision of the main coping scale and worsened the variance explained by the measure. Therefore, the six items were retained within the main scale. Our CAT simulation indicated that, on average, less than 10 items are required to gain a precise measurement of coping. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to develop a psychometrically robust coping instrument for hereditary retinal diseases. CAT simulation indicated that on an average, only four and nine items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, validity, and reliability of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Short Form (PROMIS10) in outpatients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: SLE outpatients completed PROMIS10, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), LupusQoL-US, and selected PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CAT) at routine visits at an SLE Center of Excellence. Construct validity was evaluated by correlating PROMIS10 physical and mental health scores with PROMIS CAT, legacy instruments, and physician-derived measures of disease activity and damage. Test-retest reliability was determined among subjects reporting stable SLE activity at 2 assessments 1 week apart using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: A diverse cohort of 204 out of 238 patients with SLE (86%) completed survey instruments. PROMIS10 physical health scores strongly correlated with physical function, pain, and social health domains in PROMIS CAT, SF-36, and LupusQoL, while mental health scores strongly correlated with PROMIS depression CAT, SF-36, and LupusQoL mental health domains (Spearman correlations >/= 0.70). Active arthritis, comorbid fibromyalgia (FM), and anxiety were associated with worse PROMIS10 scores, but sociodemographic factors and physician-assessed flare status were not. Test-retest reliability for PROMIS10 physical and mental health scores was high (ICC >/= 0.85). PROMIS10 required < 2 minutes to complete. CONCLUSION: PROMIS10 is valid and reliable, and can efficiently screen for impaired physical function, pain, and emotional distress in outpatients with SLE. With strong correlations to LupusQoL and SF-36 but significantly reduced responder burden, PROMIS10 is a promising tool for measuring patient-reported outcomes in routine SLE clinical care and value-based healthcare initiatives.

AB  - In this paper, we summarise and critique a network meta-analysis (NMA) of antidepressant efficacy and tolerability for paediatric depression and an accompanying editorial. Although we agree that many of the extant studies are flawed, this meta-analysis showed clear efficacy of fluoxetine in the NMA, and for sertraline and escitalopram in pairwise analyses. Consequently, these papers underestimate the benefits of antidepressants for paediatric depression, and provide support for current practice guideline, which recommends the use of an antidepressant if the patient does not respond to psychotherapy. In these circumstances, fluoxetine should be the first choice, with escitalopram and sertraline as alternatives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement instruments that are used for monitoring patients in mental health care are developed according to the principles of classical test theory. Because the assumptions underlying this theory are outdated, this is a good time to work towards a new method of measurement known as computerised adaptive testing (CAT), the method being based on item response theory. AIM: To introduce the CAT-methodology into Dutch mental health care, and provide an overview of the current and desirable developments. METHOD: We explain what CAT is and why mental health care should warmly welcome this new development. We also outline the limitations of CAT, summarise the developments that have already been made nationally and internationally and consider some developments we think are desirable. RESULTS: PROMIS item banks for anxiety and depression for adults show that CAT is more efficient than instruments currently in use and is able to produce very precise outcomes. CONCLUSION: The first CATs for anxiety and depression will be available late 2017 or early 2018 for adults receiving mental health care in the Netherlands. Recent results are very impressive and CAT-technology will increase the efficiency of symptom measurements, bringing these measurements to a higher level.

AB  - The potential impact of brain training methods for enhancing human cognition in healthy and clinical populations has motivated increasing public interest and scientific scrutiny. At issue is the merits of intervention modalities, such as computer-based cognitive training, physical exercise training, and non-invasive brain stimulation, and whether such interventions synergistically enhance cognition. To investigate this issue, we conducted a comprehensive 4-month randomized controlled trial in which 318 healthy, young adults were enrolled in one of five interventions: (1) Computer-based cognitive training on six adaptive tests of executive function; (2) Cognitive and physical exercise training; (3) Cognitive training combined with non-invasive brain stimulation and physical exercise training; (4) Active control training in adaptive visual search and change detection tasks; and (5) Passive control. Our findings demonstrate that multimodal training significantly enhanced learning (relative to computer-based cognitive training alone) and provided an effective method to promote skill learning across multiple cognitive domains, spanning executive functions, working memory, and planning and problem solving. These results help to establish the beneficial effects of multimodal intervention and identify key areas for future research in the continued effort to improve human cognition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficient screening questionnaires are useful in general practice. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a method to improve the efficiency of questionnaires, as only the items that are particularly informative for a certain responder are dynamically selected. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT could improve the efficiency of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ), a frequently used self-report questionnaire designed to assess common psychosocial problems in general practice. METHODS: A simulation study was conducted using a sample of Dutch patients visiting a general practitioner (GP) with psychological problems (n=379). Responders completed a paper-and-pencil version of the 50-item 4DSQ and a psychometric evaluation was performed to check if the data agreed with item response theory (IRT) assumptions. Next, a CAT simulation was performed for each of the four 4DSQ scales (distress, depression, anxiety, and somatization), based on the given responses as if they had been collected through CAT. The following two stopping rules were applied for the administration of items: (1) stop if measurement precision is below a predefined level, or (2) stop if more than half of the items of the subscale are administered. RESULTS: In general, the items of each of the four scales agreed with IRT assumptions. Application of the first stopping rule reduced the length of the questionnaire by 38% (from 50 to 31 items on average). When the second stopping rule was also applied, the total number of items could be reduced by 56% (from 50 to 22 items on average). CONCLUSIONS: CAT seems useful for improving the efficiency of the 4DSQ by 56% without losing a considerable amount of measurement precision. The CAT version of the 4DSQ may be useful as part of an online assessment to investigate the severity of mental health problems of patients visiting a GP. This simulation study is the first step needed for the development a CAT version of the 4DSQ. A CAT version of the 4DSQ could be of high value for Dutch GPs since increasing numbers of patients with mental health problems are visiting the general practice. In further research, the results of a real-time CAT should be compared with the results of the administration of the full scale.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess reliability and validity of three single leg standing clinical tests in patients with plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS). DESIGN: Cross-sectional reliability study. PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients diagnosed with PHPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients stood on their affected foot in a static stance for up to 30seconds, a half squat for up to 10 repetitions, and a heel rise for up to 10 repetitions. The first sensation of pain (p1) determined the termination of each test, and established a positive test result. The level of p1 was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS); time or repetitions for each test were recorded. Prior to performing the tests, all patients completed the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test to measure functional status (FS). RESULTS: Detection of p1 in each test showed good reliability for inter- and intrarater assessment (Kappa=0.60 to 0.78 and 0.56 to 0.77, respectively). The intraclass correlation coefficient for the VAS measures was 0.85 to 0.95 for inter-rater assessment and 0.78 to 0.92 for intrarater assessment. However, the Bland and Altman limits of agreement were wide, indicating that these measures were less reliable than the correlation coefficients suggested. Thirty-five patients (88%) experienced a positive pain response to at least one test. Significant correlations were found between the VAS measures in each test and FS (r=0.63 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The static stance, half squat and heel rise tests were easily implemented, and found to be reliable and valid according to one analysis, yet less reliable with another, for pain provocation and VAS levels in patients with PHPS. All three VAS levels correlated well with FS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life is inconsistently captured among children with cleft lip and palate. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) captures health-related quality of life, with the added benefit of comparability across clinical conditions. In this study, the authors define the validity and feasibility of PROMIS among children with clefts. METHODS: Children with cleft lip and palate who were at least 5 years old and able to complete instruments independently were eligible for inclusion (n = 93). Children completed PROMIS anxiety, depression, and peer relationship item banks as short forms or computerized adaptive tests. Participants also completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Construct validity was measured by Spearman correlations between PROMIS and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory controlling for race, sex, age, and income. Feasibility was measured using instrument completion time, reading level, and floor/ceiling effects. RESULTS: PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (peer relationship, r = 0.49; depression, r = -0.56; and anxiety, r = -0.36) and short forms (peer relationship, r = 0.65; depression, r = -0.54; and anxiety, r = -0.56) demonstrated moderate correlation with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Computerized adaptive tests had fewer floor (0 percent versus 0 percent) and ceiling (8.6 to 19.3 percent versus 21.8 to 41.9 percent) effects than short forms, and demonstrated better readability. Computerized adaptive tests required more time than short forms (peer relationship, 0.84 +/- 0.67 versus 1.3 +/- 0.92; depression, 0.52 +/- 0.38 versus 1.1 +/- 0.73; and anxiety, 0.53 +/- 0.23 versus 1.1 +/- 0.62; p = 0.001), as each computerized adaptive test included on average four more questions. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS correlates well with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and demonstrates similar accuracy, with better readability and efficiency. Use of PROMIS will improve our ability to compare children with cleft lip and palate to diverse populations and clinical conditions. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic, II.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acupuncture has been shown to alleviate symptoms and increase general well-being in different medical patient samples. A major challenge in acupuncture clinical research is the availability of comparable and standardized patient-reported outcome measurement (PRO) tools. OBJECTIVES: This study used a pragmatic design to examine longitudinal changes in quality of life (QOL) in a medical patient sample following acupuncture using PROs from the National Institutes of Health's Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative. It also examined the role of acupuncture expectancies, as well as patient and provider perceptions of acupuncture benefit. DESIGN: Following informed consent, patients completed baseline QOL measures (T1) prior to their first acupuncture session. Subsequent assessments (up to 20) were completed immediately following ensuing acupuncture sessions. Patients completed assessments either on a touch-screen computer at the clinic or from their home computer. RESULTS: Compared with acupuncture-naive participants, those who received prior acupuncture treatment reported significantly higher anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and lower positive affect at baseline. By the second assessment, however, these differences became nonexistent. Participants who held greater baseline acupuncture expectations (e.g., their situation would improve a lot, they would have improved coping skills, their symptoms would disappear, their energy would increase) reported significantly higher fatigue, pain interference, and problems with physical functioning. Between T1 and T2, all participants reported significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Exploratory longitudinal models demonstrated significant linear improvements over time in anxiety (p = 0.006), depression (p = 0.007), pain interference (p < 0.001), and sleep disturbance (p = 0.004). No linear reduction over time was found with fatigue (p = 0.587), physical function (p = 0.654), or positive affect (p = 0.247). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, PROMIS computer adaptive tests were able to assess domains of QOL briefly. Although pretreatment acupuncture expectations highlighted subgroup differences in outcomes at baseline, linear-growth models demonstrated the positive effects of acupuncture over time on anxiety, depression, pain interference, and sleep disturbance.

AB  - Reducing the response burden of standardized pain measures is desirable, particularly for individuals who are frail or live with chronic illness, e.g., those suffering from cancer and those in palliative care. The Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System((R)) (PROMIS((R))) project addressed this issue with the provision of computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and short form measures that can be used clinically and in research. Although there has been substantial evaluation of PROMIS item banks, little is known about the performance of PROMIS short forms, particularly in ethnically diverse groups. Reviewed in this article are findings related to the differential item functioning (DIF) and reliability of the PROMIS pain interference short forms across diverse sociodemographic groups. METHODS: DIF hypotheses were generated for the PROMIS short form pain interference items. Initial analyses tested item response theory (IRT) model assumptions of unidimensionality and local independence. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor analytic methods; local dependence (LD) was tested using IRT-based LD indices. Wald tests were used to examine group differences in IRT parameters, and to test DIF hypotheses. A second DIF-detection method used in sensitivity analyses was based on ordinal logistic regression with a latent IRT-derived conditioning variable. Magnitude and impact of DIF were investigated, and reliability and item and scale information statistics were estimated. RESULTS: The reliability of the short form item set was excellent. However, there were a few items with high local dependency, which affected the estimation of the final discrimination parameters. As a result, the item, "How much did pain interfere with enjoyment of social activities?" was excluded in the DIF analyses for all subgroup comparisons. No items were hypothesized to show DIF for race and ethnicity; however, five items showed DIF after adjustment for multiple comparisons in both primary and sensitivity analyses: ability to concentrate, enjoyment of recreational activities, tasks away from home, participation in social activities, and socializing with others. The magnitude of DIF was small and the impact negligible. Three items were consistently identified with DIF for education: enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, and enjoyment of recreational activities. No item showed DIF above the magnitude threshold and the impact of DIF on the overall measure was minimal. No item showed gender DIF after correction for multiple comparisons in the primary analyses. Four items showed consistent age DIF: enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, day to day activities, and enjoyment of recreational activities, none with primary magnitude values above threshold. Conditional on the pain state, Spanish speakers were hypothesized to report less pain interference on one item, enjoyment of life. The DIF findings confirmed the hypothesis; however, the magnitude was small. Using an arbitrary cutoff point of theta (theta) >/= 1.0 to classify respondents with acute pain interference, the highest number of changes were for the education groups analyses. There were 231 respondents (4% of the total sample) who changed from the designation of no acute pain interference to acute interference after the DIF adjustment. There was no change in the designations for race/ethnic subgroups, and a small number of changes for respondents aged 65 to 84. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant DIF was observed after correction for multiple comparisons, all DIF was of low magnitude and impact. However, some individual-level impact was observed for low education groups. Reliability estimates were high. Thus, the PROMIS short form pain items examined in this ethnically diverse sample performed relatively well; although one item was problematic and removed from the analyses. It is concluded that the majority of the PROMIS pain interference short form items can be recommended for use among ethnically diverse groups, including those in palliative care and with cancer and chronic illness.

AB  - The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was devised to facilitate assessment of patient self-reported health status, taking advantage of Item Response Theory. We aimed to assess measurement properties of the PROMIS Depression item bank and an 8-item static short form in a Spanish clinical sample. A three-month follow-up study of patients with active mood/anxiety symptoms (n = 218) was carried out. We assessed model unidimensionality (Confirmatory Item Factor Analysis), reliability (internal consistency and Item Information Curves), and validity (convergent-discriminant with correlations; known-groups with comparison of means and effect sizes; and criterion validity with Receiver operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis). We also assessed 3-month responsiveness to change (Cohen's effect sizes (d) in stable and recovered patients). The unidimensional model showed adequate fit (CFI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.08). Information Curves had reliabilities over 0.90 throughout most of the score continuum. As expected, we observed high correlations with external self-reported depression, and moderate with self-reported anxiety and clinical measures. The item bank showed an increasing severity gradient from no disorder (mean = 48, SE = 0.6) to depression with comorbid anxiety (mean = 55.8, SE = 0.4). PROMIS detected depression disorder with great accuracy according to the area under the curve (AUC = 0.89). Both formats, item bank and short form, were highly responsive to change in recovered patients (d > 0.7) and had small changes in stable patients (d < 0.2). The good metric properties of the Spanish PROMIS Depression measures provide further evidence of their adequacy for monitoring depression levels of patients in clinical settings. This double check of quality (within countries and populations) supports the ability of PROMIS measures for guaranteeing fair comparisons across languages and countries in specific clinical populations.

DESIGN: Using a mixed-methods design, we developed and tested a Psychological Trauma item bank with patient and provider focus groups, cognitive interviews, and item response theory based analytic approaches, including tests of model fit, differential item functioning (DIF) and precision. SETTING: We tested a 31-item pool at several medical institutions across the United States, including the University of Michigan, Kessler Foundation, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the University of Washington, Craig Hospital and the James J. Peters/Bronx Veterans Administration hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 716 individuals with SCI completed the trauma items RESULTS: The 31 items fit a unidimensional model (CFI=0.952; RMSEA=0.061) and demonstrated good precision (theta range between 0.6 and 2.5). Nine items demonstrated negligible DIF with little impact on score estimates. The final calibrated item bank contains 19 items CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL Psychological Trauma item bank is a psychometrically robust measurement tool from which a short form and a computer adaptive test (CAT) version are available.

AB  - To confirm associations with a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each with only a small effect size, as hypothesized in the polygenic theory for schizophrenia, the International Schizophrenia Consortium (2009, Nature 460:748-752) proposed a polygenic risk score (PRS) test and demonstrated its effectiveness when applied to psychiatric disorders. The basic idea of the PRS test is to use a half of the sample to select and up-weight those more likely to be associated SNPs, and then use the other half of the sample to test for aggregated effects of the selected SNPs. Intrigued by the novelty and increasing use of the PRS test, we aimed to evaluate and improve its performance for GWAS data. First, by an analysis of the PRS test, we point out its connection with the Sum test [Chapman and Whittaker, Genet Epidemiol 32:560-566; Pan, Genet Epidemiol 33:497-507]; given the known advantages and disadvantages of the Sum test, this connection motivated the development of several other polygenic tests, some of which may be more powerful than the PRS test under certain situations. Second, more importantly, to overcome the low statistical efficiency of the data-splitting strategy as adopted in the PRS test, we reformulate and thus modify the PRS test, obtaining several adaptive tests, which are closely related to the adaptive sum of powered score (SPU) test studied in the context of rare variant analysis [Pan et al., 2014, Genetics 197:1081-1095]. We use both simulated data and a real GWAS dataset of alcohol dependence to show dramatically improved power of the new tests over the PRS test; due to its superior performance and simplicity, we recommend the whole sample-based adaptive SPU test for polygenic testing. We hope to raise the awareness of the limitations of the PRS test and potential power gain of the adaptive SPU test.

AB  - Utilization of patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) had been limited by the lack of psychometrically sound measures scored in real-time. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative developed a broad array of high-quality PRO measures. Towards reducing the number of items administered in measuring PROs, PROMIS employs Item Response Theory (IRT) and Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT). By only administering questions targeted to the subject's trait level, CAT has cut testing times in half(1). The IRT/CAT implementation in PROMIS is unidimensional in that there is a separate set of questions administered for each measured trait. However, there are often correlations among traits. Multidimensional IRT (MIRT) and multidimensional CAT (MCAT) provide items concerning several correlated traits, and should ameliorate patient burden. We developed an MIRT model using existing PROMIS item banks for depression and anxiety, developed MCAT software, and compared the efficiency of the MCAT approach to the unidimensional approach.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking behavior is influenced by social motivations such as the expected social benefits of smoking and the social cues that induce craving. This paper describes development of the PROMIS Social Motivations for Smoking item banks, which will serve to standardize assessment of these social motivations among daily and nondaily smokers. METHODS: Daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N =1,183) smokers completed an online survey. Item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and differential item functioning analyses were conducted to identify a unidimensional set of items for each group. Short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive tests (CATs) were evaluated as tools for more efficiently assessing this construct. RESULTS: A total of 15 items were included in the item banks (9 items common to daily and nondaily smokers, 3 unique to daily, 3 unique to nondaily). Scores based on full item banks are highly reliable (reliability = 0.90-0.91). Additionally, the item banks are strongly unidimensional and perform similarly across gender, age, and race/ethnicity groups. A fixed SF for use with both daily and nondaily smokers consists of 4 items (reliability = 0.80). Results from simulated CATs showed that, on average, fewer than 5 items are needed to assess this construct with adequate precision using the item banks. CONCLUSIONS: A new set of items has been identified for assessing the social motivations for smoking in a reliable, standardized manner for daily and nondaily smokers. In addition to using the full item banks, efficient assessment can be achieved by using SFs, employing CATs, or selecting items tailored to specific research or clinical purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Missing data are unavoidable in clinical research. Older age, female gender, and fewer years of education are risk factors for missing items in a questionnaire. This study assessed the differences between patients with complete and incomplete Disabilities of the Arms, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires in terms of demographics and psychological factors. METHODS: We analyzed a convenience sample of 1,204 patients enrolled in eight prospective studies. The DASH and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were completed by all patients. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, and an ordinal pain scale were completed by 745, 493, 545, and 391 patients, respectively. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to determine risk factors for incomplete (one or more unanswered question) or invalid (more than three unanswered questions) DASH questionnaires. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients did not complete all questions on the DASH. Patients with an incomplete DASH were older, had fewer years of education, and had higher levels of catastrophic thinking, depression, and pain anxiety. Age and catastrophic thinking were retained in the best logistic regression models of predictors of both incomplete and invalid DASH questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that patients who complete disability questionnaires are different from patients who do not may affect the interpretation of clinical research. Computer adaptive testing may be preferable to avoid incomplete questionnaires. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article describes the procedures used in the PROMIS Smoking Initiative for the development and evaluation of item banks, short forms (SFs), and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for the assessment of 6 constructs related to cigarette smoking: nicotine dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and sensory expectancies, health expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social motivations for smoking. METHODS: Analyses were conducted using response data from a large national sample of smokers. Items related to each construct were subjected to extensive item factor analyses and evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF). Final item banks were calibrated, and SF assessments were developed for each construct. The performance of the SFs and the potential use of the item banks for CAT administration were examined through simulation study. RESULTS: Item selection based on dimensionality assessment and DIF analyses produced item banks that were essentially unidimensional in structure and free of bias. Simulation studies demonstrated that the constructs could be accurately measured with a relatively small number of carefully selected items, either through fixed SFs or CAT-based assessment. Illustrative results are presented, and subsequent articles provide detailed discussion of each item bank in turn. CONCLUSIONS: The development of the PROMIS smoking item banks provides researchers with new tools for measuring smoking-related constructs. The use of the calibrated item banks and suggested SF assessments will enhance the quality of score estimates, thus advancing smoking research. Moreover, the methods used in the current study, including innovative approaches to item selection and SF construction, may have general relevance to item bank development and evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Computer Adaptive Test version of the Community Reintegration of Injured Service Members measure (CRIS-CAT) consists of three scales measuring Extent of, Perceived Limitations in, and Satisfaction with community integration. The CRIS-CAT was developed using item response theory methods. The purposes of this study were to assess the reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive validity and respondent burden of the CRIS-CAT.The CRIS-CAT was developed using item response theory methods. The purposes of this study were to assess the reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive validity and respondent burden of the CRIS-CAT. METHODS: This was a three-part study that included a 1) a cross-sectional field study of 517 homeless, employed, and Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans; who completed all items in the CRIS item set, 2) a cohort study with one year follow-up study of 135 OEF/OIF Veterans, and 3) a 50-person study of CRIS-CAT administration. Conditional reliability of simulated CAT scores was calculated from the field study data, and concurrent validity and known group validity were examined using Pearson product correlations and ANOVAs. Data from the cohort were used to examine the ability of the CRIS-CAT to predict key one year outcomes. Data from the CRIS-CAT administration study were used to calculate ICC (2,1) minimum detectable change (MDC), and average number of items used during CAT administration. RESULTS: Reliability scores for all scales were above 0.75, but decreased at both ends of the score continuum. CRIS-CAT scores were correlated with concurrent validity indicators and differed significantly between the three Veteran groups (P < .001). The odds of having any Emergency Room visits were reduced for Veterans with better CRIS-CAT scores (Extent, Perceived Satisfaction respectively: OR = 0.94, 0.93, 0.95; P < .05). CRIS-CAT scores were predictive of SF-12 physical and mental health related quality of life scores at the 1 year follow-up. Scales had ICCs >0.9. MDCs were 5.9, 6.2, and 3.6, respectively for Extent, Perceived and Satisfaction subscales. Number of items (mn, SD) administered at Visit 1 were 14.6 (3.8) 10.9 (2.7) and 10.4 (1.7) respectively for Extent, Perceived and Satisfaction subscales. CONCLUSION: The CRIS-CAT demonstrated sound measurement properties including reliability, construct, known group and predictive validity, and it was administered with minimal respondent burden. These findings support the use of this measure in assessing community reintegration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients have an impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which is usually analysed using static paper-pencil questionnaires. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computerised adaptive testing (CAT) are flexible, freely available, noncopyrighted, HRQOL instruments with US-based norms across 11 domains. CAT presents five to seven questions/domain depending on the patient's response, from large validated question banks. This provides brevity and precision equivalent to the entire question bank. AIM: To evaluate PROMIS CAT tools against 'legacy instruments' for cirrhotics and their informal caregivers. METHODS: A total of 200 subjects: 100 cirrhotics (70 men, 53% decompensated) and 100 caregivers were administered the PROMIS and legacy instruments [Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Beck depression/anxiety inventories, Pittsburgh Sleep-Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS)] concurrently. Both legacy and PROMIS results for patients were compared with caregivers and US norms. These were also compared between compensated and decompensated patients. Preference for SIP or PROMIS was inquired of a selected group (n = 70, 50% patients). Test - retest reliability was assessed in another group of 20 patients. RESULTS: Patients had significant impairment on all PROMIS domains apart from anger and anxiety compared with caregivers and US norms (P < 0.02 to <0.0001). Decompensated patients had significantly worse sleep, pain, social and physical function scores compared with compensated ones, similar to legacy instruments. There was a statistically significant correlation between PROMIS and their corresponding legacy instruments. The majority (71%) preferred PROMIS over SIP. PROMIS tools had significant test - retest reliability (ICC range 0.759-0.985) when administered 12 +/- 6 days apart. CONCLUSION: PROMIS computerised adaptive testing tools had significant concurrent and discriminant validity, test - retest reliability and subject preference for assessing HRQOL in cirrhotic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Dyspnea Management Questionnaire (DMQ) is a measure of the psychosocial and behavioral responses to dyspnea for adults with COPD. The research objectives were to evaluate the reliability and validity of an expanded DMQ item pool, as a preliminary step for developing a computer adaptive test. METHODS: The original 66 items of the DMQ were used for the analyses. The sample included 63 women and 44 men with COPD (n = 107) recruited from two urban medical centers. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the factor structure of the DMQ and its underlying cognitive-behavioral theoretical base. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and breadth of coverage of the expanded DMQ item bank were also evaluated. RESULTS: Five distinct dyspnea domains were confirmed using 56 original items of the DMQ: dyspnea intensity, dyspnea anxiety, activity avoidance, activity self-efficacy, and strategy satisfaction. Overall, the breadth of items was excellent with a good match between sample scores and item difficulty. The DMQ-56 showed good internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.85-to 0.96) and good preliminary test-retest reliability over a 3-week interval (ICC = 0.69-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The DMQ demonstrated acceptable levels of reliability and validity for measuring multidimensional dyspnea outcomes after medical, psychological, and behavioral interventions for adults with COPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a prototype measure (OA-DISABILITY-CAT) for osteoarthritis research using item response theory (IRT) and computer-adaptive test (CAT) methodologies. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We constructed an item bank consisting of 33 activities commonly affected by lower extremity (LE) osteoarthritis. A sample of 323 adults with LE osteoarthritis reported their degree of limitation in performing everyday activities, and completed the Health Assessment Questionnaire-II (HAQ-II). We used confirmatory factor analyses to assess scale unidimensionality and IRT methods to calibrate the items and examine the fit of the data. Using CAT simulation analyses, we examined the performance of OA-DISABILITY-CATs of different lengths compared with the full-item bank and the HAQ-II. RESULTS: One distinct disability domain was identified. The 10-item OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated a high degree of accuracy compared with the full-item bank (r=0.99). The item bank and the HAQ-II scales covered a similar estimated scoring range. In terms of reliability, 95% of OA-DISABILITY reliability estimates were over 0.83 vs. 0.60 for the HAQ-II. Except at the highest scores, the 10-item OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated superior precision to the HAQ-II. CONCLUSION: The prototype OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated promising measurement properties compared with the HAQ-II, and is recommended for use in LE osteoarthritis research.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluate a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire that uses computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to measure the impact of osteoarthritis (OA) on functioning and well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OA patients completed 37 questions about the impact of OA on physical, social and role functioning, emotional well-being, and vitality. Questionnaire responses were calibrated and scored using item response theory, and two scores were estimated: a Total-OA score based on patients' responses to all 37 questions, and a simulated CAT-OA score where the computer selected and scored the five most informative questions for each patient. Agreement between Total-OA and CAT-OA scores was assessed using correlations. Discriminant validity of Total-OA and CAT-OA scores was assessed with analysis of variance. Criterion measures included OA pain and severity, patient global assessment, and missed work days. RESULTS: Simulated CAT-OA and Total-OA scores correlated highly (r = 0.96). Both Total-OA and simulated CAT-OA scores discriminated significantly between patients differing on the criterion measures. F-statistics across criterion measures ranged from 39.0 (P < .001) to 225.1 (P < .001) for the Total-OA score, and from 40.5 (P < .001) to 221.5 (P < .001) for the simulated CAT-OA score. CONCLUSIONS: CAT methods produce valid and precise estimates of the impact of OA on functioning and well-being with significant reduction in response burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To develop computerized adaptive tests (CATs) designed to assess lower extremity functional status (FS) in people with lower extremity impairments using items from the Lower Extremity Functional Scale and compare discriminant validity of FS measures generated using all items analyzed with a rating scale Item Response Theory model (theta(IRT)) and measures generated using the simulated CATs (theta(CAT)). METHODS: Secondary analysis of retrospective intake rehabilitation data. RESULTS: Unidimensionality of items was strong, and local independence of items was adequate. Differential item functioning (DIF) affected item calibration related to body part, that is, hip, knee, or foot/ankle, but DIF did not affect item calibration for symptom acuity, gender, age, or surgical history. Therefore, patients were separated into three body part specific groups. The rating scale model fit all three data sets well. Three body part specific CATs were developed: each was 70% more efficient than using all LEFS items to estimate FS measures. theta(IRT) and theta(CAT) measures discriminated patients by symptom acuity, age, and surgical history in similar ways. theta(CAT) measures were as precise as theta(IRT) measures. CONCLUSION: Body part-specific simulated CATs were efficient and produced precise measures of FS with good discriminant validity.

AB  - Identifying health-related quality of life concerns is a priority when caring for people with cancer. Specific problem areas such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, disease- and treatment-related symptoms, as well as physical functioning can be routinely assessed using applications that draw upon item response theory. Item response theory measurement models can improve on the classical approach to health-related quality of life assessment with advantages that include comparison of patients across diverse instruments, flexibility in degree of precision desired, availability of multiple short forms, interval measurement and capability for individual assessment (real-time clinical monitoring) using computerized adaptive testing. This review describes a model of health-related quality of life in oncology and the contribution of item response theory to assessment using that model.

AB  - The comparability and validity of a computerized adaptive (CA) Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) were assessed in a sample of 571 undergraduate college students. The CA MMPI-2 administered adaptively Scales L, E the 10 clinical scales, and the 15 content scales, utilizing the countdown method (Butcher, Keller, & Bacon, 1985). All subjects completed the MMPI-2 twice, with three experimental conditions: booklet test-retest, booklet-CA, and conventional computerized (CC)-CA. Profiles across administration modalities show a high degree of similarity, providing evidence for the comparability of the three forms. Correlations between MMPI-2 scales and other psychometric measures (Beck Depression Inventory; Symptom Checklist-Revised; State-Trait Anxiety and Anger Scales; and the Anger Expression Scale) support the validity of the CA MMPI-2. Substantial item savings may be realized with the implementation of the countdown procedure.
