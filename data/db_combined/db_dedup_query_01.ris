AB  - Multistage test (MST) designs promise efficient student ability estimates, an indispensable asset for individual diagnostics in high-stakes educational assessments. In high-stakes testing, annually changing test forms are required because publicly known test items impair accurate student ability estimation, and items of bad model fit must be continually replaced to guarantee test quality. This requires a large and continually refreshed item pool as the basis for high-stakes MST. In practice, the calibration of newly developed items to feed annually changing tests is highly resource intensive. Piloting based on a representative sample of students is often not feasible, given that, for schools, participation in actual high-stakes assessments already requires considerable organizational effort. Hence, under practical constraints, the calibration of newly developed items may take place on the go in the form of a concurrent calibration in MST designs. Based on a simulation approach this paper focuses on the performance of Rasch vs. 2PL modeling in retrieving item parameters when items are for practical reasons non-optimally placed in multistage tests. Overall, the results suggest that the 2PL model performs worse in retrieving item parameters compared to the Rasch model when there is non-optimal item assembly in the MST; especially in retrieving parameters at the margins. The higher flexibility of 2PL modeling, where item discrimination is allowed to vary, seems to come at the cost of increased volatility in parameter estimation. Although the overall bias may be modest, single items can be affected by severe biases when using a 2PL model for item calibration in the context of non-optimal item placement.

AB  - Background/objective: Entrepreneurial behavior is of great importance nowadays owing to its significance in the generation of economic, social, personal, and cultural wellbeing. This behavior is influenced by cognitive and personality characteristics, as well as by socioeconomic and contextual factors. Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate entrepreneurial personality. Method: A bank of 120 items was created evaluating various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants (Mage = 42.34; SDage = 12.96). Results: The bank of items had an essentially unidimensional fit to the model. The CAT exhibited high accuracy for evaluating a wide range of <ce><b8> scores, using a mean of 16 items with a very low standard error (M = 0.157). Relative validity evidence for the CAT was obtained with two additional tests of entrepreneurial personality (the Battery for the Assessment of the Enterprising Personality and the Measure of Enterpreneurial Tendencies and Abilities), with correlations of .908 and .657, respectively. Conclusions: The CAT developed has appropriate psychometric properties for the evaluation of entrepreneurial people. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Depressive disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and cause substantial harm and affliction as well as reduced quality of life and impaired psychosocial functioning. Apart from the clinical interview, questionnaires represent the most established and economic diagnostic instruments for depression. A multiplicity of questionnaires for depression has been developed across the past decades. However, several studies demonstrated substantial psychometric shortcomings of many depression questionnaires. Thus, further enhancements in this area appear to be mandatory. The present thesis comprises three studies that aim at further improving the quality of diagnostic methods for depression by making the benefits of modern test theoretical approaches, particularly the Rasch-Model, one of the Item-Response-Theory-Models, available for clinical practice. The first study aimed at providing an ample pool of depression items - the basic requirement for item bank calibration. A thorough review of existing diagnostic tools for depression and relevant literature led to a comprehensive compilation of depression items. Based on the relevance judgments of 49 adept clinical experts 157 relevant items were identified. An additional major finding of Study One was that clinical psychologists tended to regard emotional/ cognitive items as more important than psychiatrists while the latter tended to judge somatic items as more relevant than clinical psychologists. However, across all experts items about somatic complaints were considered as not relevant. The second study was the core of the current thesis and - based on the item pool of Study One - aimed at developing a calibrated item bank for depression and evaluating its psychometric properties. Evaluation of Rasch Model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), dimensionality, local independence, item spread, item and person separation, and reliability resulted in a bank of 79 items that showed good psychometric properties. However, a minority of items showed DIF that must be dealt with in all future applications and utilizations of the bank. Thus, CAT applications on the basis of the item bank should incorporate separate item difficulty estimates for the respective groups (e.g., female vs. male test takers) and questionnaires derived from the bank should hold gender or age dependent norms. Study Three aimed at exemplifying how the Rasch calibrated item bank for depression may be utilized by the derivation of two parallel short but sensitive static depression questionnaires that should cover a sufficiently high spread of depression severities with high test accuracy. This major aim was achieved with the development of the Rasch-based Screening for Depression I and II (DESC-I/ -II), a short depression scale in two parallel forms comprising 10 items each. This instrument may provide considerable benefits in retest applications and for screening purposes in mentally as well as somatically ill patients. Future investigations should engage in validating item calibrations and Rasch model fit of the item bank in a larger sample and DIF analyses should be repeated. Furthermore, psychometric properties of DESC-I and -II should be further investigated, including e.g. evaluation of its retest reliability and sensitivity to change, especially in heterogeneously composed samples that realistically reflect the patient mixture encountered by the practitioner. Finally, the adaptive algorithm that accesses the calibrated item bank should be built and evaluated to allow for computer-adaptive test applications. Taken together, the results of the present thesis constitute a psychometrically sound basis for computer-adaptive testing and provide a promising new screening instrument for depression ready for use. If the major suggestions for future investigations on the basis of the current findings are further pursued, a substantial leap towards better quality and heightened convenience for both patient and diagnostician in depression diagnostics is in near reach.

Admission to University is accompanied by the transition to a new educational system, new social environment, which causes need for adaptating first-year students to the educational process. The article considers social, pedagogical and psychological factor, both positive and negative affecting the pedagogical process and the content of systematic adaptation while educating first-year students in the conditions of a University branch. Under conditions of realizing federal state educational standards of higher professional education it is estimated that adaptation is possible by means of individualizing instructions and implementing objective approach into teaching all courses including Physics. The article offers some ways of solving the problem of educational adaptation given on the basis of teaching first-year students Physics at a Polytechnics branch.

AB  - We used the Dutch<e2><80><93>Flemish version of the USA PROMIS adult V1.0 item bank for Anxiety as input for developing a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure the entire latent anxiety continuum. First, psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample (N = 2,010) showed that the 29-item bank has psychometric properties that are required for a CAT administration. Second, a post hoc CAT simulation showed efficient and highly precise measurement, with an average number of 8.64 items for the clinical sample, and 9.48 items for the general population sample. Furthermore, the accuracy of our CAT version was highly similar to that of the full item bank administration, both in final score estimates and in distinguishing clinical subjects from persons without a mental health disorder. We discuss the future directions and limitations of CAT development with the Dutch<e2><80><93>Flemish version of the PROMIS Anxiety item bank.

AB  - Recently, adaptive test approaches have become a viable alternative to traditional fixed-item tests. The main advantage of adaptive tests is that they reach desired measurement precision with fewer items. However, fewer items mean that each item has a more significant effect on ability estimation and therefore those tests are open to more consequential results from any flaw in an item. So, any items indicating differential item functioning (DIF) may play an important role in examinees&#039; test scores. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effect of DIF items on the performance of computer adaptive and multi-stage tests. For this purpose, different test designs were tested under different test lengths and ratios of DIF items using Monte Carlo simulation. As a result, it was seen that computer adaptive test (CAT) designs had the best measurement precision over all conditions. When multi-stage test (MST) panel designs were compared, it was found that the 1-3-3 design had higher measurement precision in most of the conditions; however, the findings were not enough to say that 1-3-3 design performed better than the 1-2-4 design. Furthermore, CAT was found to be the least affected design by the increase of ratio of DIF items. MST designs were affected by that increment especially in the 10-item length test. ; Recently, adaptive test approaches have become a viable alternative to traditional fixed-item tests.

AB  - International audience ; SRAM testing is becoming more and more challenging due to issues caused by continuous device scaling. Fabricated SRAMs are submitted to random and systematic process variability, which strongly affect the cell's behavior and also the ability of test algorithms to detect faults. Traditionally, bias conditions have been used to improve the behavior of the SRAM under process variations by applying body bias to compensate for the effect of variability. Based on the same principle, bias conditions also affect the cell's behavior when resistive-opens are present, hence affecting test's defect coverage capability. Both body- and source-bias conditions are analyzed in this paper to find the way to improve defect detect ability in the SRAM cell. Source-biasing has been proven to be the more effective of the two, leading to more than 3X improvement of the defect detected value. Also, by adapting the source-bias conditions to process parameter values, over- and under-testing of the SRAM can be avoided.

AB  - Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous studies.

AB  - Objective: The authors developed a computerized adaptive test for anxiety that decreases patient and clinician burden and increases measurement precision. Method: A total of 1,614 individuals with and without generalized anxiety disorder from a psychiatric clinic and community mental health center were recruited. The focus of the present study was the development of the Computerized Adaptive Testing<e2><80><93>Anxiety Inventory (CAT-ANX). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was used to obtain diagnostic classifications of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Results: An average of 12 items per subject was required to achieve a 0.3 standard error in the anxiety severity estimate and maintain a correlation of 0.94 with the total 431-item test score. CAT-ANX scores were strongly related to the probability of a generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis. Using both the Computerized Adaptive Testing<e2><80><93>- Depression Inventory and the CAT-ANX, comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder can be accurately predicted. Conclusions: Traditional measurement fixes the number of items but allows measurement uncertainty to vary. Computerized adaptive testing fixes measurement uncertainty and allows the number and content of items to vary, leading to a dramatic decrease in the number of items required for a fixed level of measurement uncertainty. Potential applications for inexpensive, efficient, and accurate screening of anxiety in primary care settings, clinical trials, psychiatric epidemiology, molecular genetics, children, and other cultures are discussed.

AB  - Alternate testing techniques have been progressively adopted as a promising solution due to their effectiveness against classical specification-based test methods. This work presents a built-in test system, which adaptively generates an indirect digital signature characterising the circuit under test, which is later used to diagnose the actual performances relying on a statistical dictionary-based diagnosis method. The system is composed of an integrated digital signature generator and a digital control and acquisition subsystem. The signature generator is based on a converter architecture, in which the analogue range can be adapted to the magnitude of the indirect measure using the well known information of the fault-free circuit. The digital subsystem controls the proposed architecture and stores the digital codes sent by the integrated digital signature generator. The digital signature generator has been designed and fabricated in an industrial 65 nm complementary metal<e2><80><93>oxide<e2><80><93>semiconductor technology from STMicroelectronics, whereas the digital control and acquisition subsystem have been prototyped in a field-programmable gate array. The fabricated system has been used to test a biquad filter affected by parametric variations. Successful experimental results are reported showing the capabilities of the proposed adaptive test system to diagnose circuit performances with discrepancies as low as 1% of the actual real value. ; Postprint (published version)

AB  - Background: With the increasingly rapid growth of the elderly population, individuals aged 65 years and above now compose 14% of Taiwanese citizens, thereby making Taiwanese society an aged society. A leading factor that affects the elderly population is dementia. A method of precisely and efficiently examining patients with dementia through multidimensional computer adaptive testing (MCAT) to accurately determine the patients<e2><80><99> stage of dementia needs to be developed. This study aimed to develop online MCAT that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, or smartphones to predict the extent of dementia for patients responding to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) instrument. Methods: The CDR was applied to 366 outpatients in a hospital in Taiwan. MCAT was employed with parameters for items across eight dimensions, and responses were simulated to compare the efficiency and precision between MCAT and non-adaptive testing (NAT). The number of items saved and the estimated person measures was compared between the results of MCAT and NAT, respectively. Results: MCAT yielded substantially more precise measurements and was considerably more efficient than NAT. MCAT achieved 20.19% (= [53 <e2><88><92> 42.3]/53) saving in item length when the measurement differences were less than 5%. Pearson correlation coefficients were highly consistent among the eight domains. The cut-off points for the overall measures were <e2><88><92> 1.4, <e2><88><92> 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 logits, which was equivalent to 20% for each portion in percentile scores. Substantially fewer items were answered through MCAT than through NAT without compromising the precision of MCAT. Conclusions: Developing a website that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, and smartphones to help them perform online screening and prediction of dementia in older adults is useful and manageable.

AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD. ; M.Sc.

AB  - Paper 106561R, 8 S. ; The Group for Quality Assurance and Industrial Image Processing has built a new experimental setup to characterize cameras and image sensors according to EMVA1288 standard. Next to the investigation of SLN (Sensitivity-Linearity- Noise) and spatial non-uniformities, the new test bench also provides an examination of the temperature dependence of sensors. The temperature dependent dark current produces an undesirable signal which affects the image quality negative and thus has to be known. It is caused by thermally induced electrons and increases linearly with exposure time as well as exponentially with temperature. To measure the dark current, it is necessary to vary and determine the temperature of the sensor. This was made possible by a climate chamber with a Peltier element, which enables a heating and cooling of the camera. An infrared sensor allows a contact-free detection of the actual camera temperature. Furthermore, the light source was improved for the new test bench. With the installed custom light source and integration sphere a homogeneous irradiation up to 97% is ensured. This way better results in tests were achieved. The light source with variable filter housing enables the use of monochromatically light in a wavelength range of 350 - 1700nm. A live monitoring of the irradiation during the image capturing is possible. A MATLAB script assists in the configuration of the camera, the measurement and the data storage. The user is guided step by step through the program. At the end of the measurements an automated evaluation follows, which illustrates graphs and parameters in a streamlined and print-ready format.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) have been proposed to facilitate assessments in mental health. These tests are built in a standard way, disregarding useful and usually available information not included in the assessment scales that could increase the precision and utility of CATs, such as the history of suicide attempts. METHODS: Using the items of a previously developed scale for suicidal risk, we compared the performance of a standard CAT and a decision tree in a support decision system to identify suicidal behavior. We included the history of past suicide attempts as a class for the separation of patients in the decision tree. RESULTS: The decision tree needed an average of four items to achieve a similar accuracy than a standard CAT with nine items. The accuracy of the decision tree, obtained after 25 cross-validations, was 81.4%. A shortened test adapted for the separation of suicidal and non-suicidal patients was developed. CONCLUSION: CATs can be very useful tools for the assessment of suicidal risk. However, standard CATs do not use all the information that is available. A decision tree can improve the precision of the assessment since they are constructed using a priori information.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes >.90). The P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may be a viable and efficient assessment method.

AB  - We developed a Dutch-Flemish version of the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) adult V1.0 item bank for depression as input for computerized adaptive testing (CAT). As item bank, we used the Dutch-Flemish translation of the original PROMIS item bank (28 items) and additionally translated 28 U.S. depression items that failed to make the final U.S. item bank. Through psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample ( N = 2,010), 8 added items were removed. With the final item bank, we performed several CAT simulations to assess the efficiency of the extended (48 items) and the original item bank (28 items), using various stopping rules. Both item banks resulted in highly efficient and precise measurement of depression and showed high similarity between the CAT simulation scores and the full item bank scores. We discuss the implications of using each item bank and stopping rule for further CAT development.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms et<c2><a0>al., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial ([greater than or equal to] |.30|) correlations. The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested.

AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a universal social skills program, the Social Skills Improvement System Classwide Intervention Program (SSIS-CIP; Elliott & Gresham, 2007), for students in first grade. Classrooms from 6 elementary schools were randomly assigned to treatment or business-as-usual control conditions. Teachers assigned to the treatment condition implemented the SSIS-CIP over a 12-week period. Students' social skills, problem behaviors, and approaches to learning were assessed via teacher ratings and direct observations of classroom behavior. In addition, their early literacy and numeracy skills were measured via computer-adaptive standardized tests. SSIS-CIP participation yielded small positive effects in students' social skills (particularly empathy and social engagement) and approaches to learning (academic motivation and engagement). Students' problem behaviors and academic skills, however, were unaffected by SSIS-CIP exposure.

TI  - Designing P-Optimal Item Pools in Computerized Adaptive Tests with Polytomous Items
BT  - ProQuest LLC
VL  - NA

PB  - NA
CY  - NA
KW  - NA
AB  - Current CAT applications consist of predominantly dichotomous items, and CATs with polytomously scored items are limited. To ascertain the best approach to polytomous CAT, a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection, ability estimation, and impact of termination rules based on polytomous IRT models. Few studies investigated the optimal pool characteristics for polytomous CAT implementation. Using the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) (Muraki, 1992), this study aims to identify an optimal item pool design for tests with polytomous items by extending the p-optimality method (Reckase, 2007). The extension includes the definition of atheta-bin to describe polytomous items succinctly for pool design, and item generation strategy using constrained nonlinear optimization method. Optimal item pools are generated using CAT simulations with and without practical constraints. The item pool characteristics under each condition are summarized and their performance is evaluated against an extended operational item pool. The results indicated that the practical constraints of the a-stratified exposure control and content balancing do not affect pool size to a large extent. However, the a-stratified control affects the pool characteristics greatly: the items included in the simulated pools with the control have larger a-parameter and provide higher maximum information on average. On the other hand, the content balancing applied in this study has little impact on pool design. The evaluation results of the pool performance are closely related to the pool characteristics. When the a-stratified exposure control applied, the consistent results include: 1) the average test information is lower than that without the constraint; 2) RMSE is higher and the correlation between the true and estimated abilities is lower; 3) the percentage of the correct classification for the highest achievement level is lower. However, for all the simulated optimal pools, while the test information is consistently above the target level 10.0, it is concluded that the a-stratified method resulted in an efficient use of less discriminative items with small decreases in measurement precision. With regard to the item pool usage, the percentage of items that are fully used, well used, rarely used, and never used are quite comparable for the pools designed with constraints. However, compared with the extended operational pool, when the a-stratified method applied, the conditional test overlap rate of the simulated pools is consistently lower. For the pool blueprint, because the normal ability distribution is assumed, more items are included in the middle of the ability scale for all simulated optimal pools. The distributions of the a- and b- parameters are similar under all conditions. When the a-stratified method applied, there are fewer items in the first stratum and the number of items in the second and third stratum is nearly identical. In addition, with the content balancing control, the number of items in the first content area is slightly less than the second one.

The population consisted of 1,740 teachers in Boromarajonani college of nursing under Boromarajchanok Institute. The data analysis using AMOS statistical program was done with the 617-return questionnaire. Results: The results showed that the theoretical model was consistent with empirical data with the following statistical metrics: relative Chi-square (CMIN/DF) < 3.00, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.05, goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and normed fit index (NFI) 0.90-1.00 were in accordance with the criteria from both the first and second order of confirmative factor analysis. The major components had factor loading ranging from 0.71 to 1.00, which is higher than the criterion as 0.70. The minor components and indicators had factor loading are higher than the criterion as 0.30. Conclusion: The finding can be used as a guideline in the planning and creation of evaluation criteria to improve the adaptive leadership of teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which is consistent with the theory and research results as well as the vision from scholars and organization. This will help improve the performance efficiency of the teachers at Boromarajonani College of Nursing which will affect the education management and education improvement.

AB  - The study evaluates an easily-administered test-anxiety reduction program. An entire fifth grade was screened, and 36 students identified as test-anxious were randomly assigned to an Intervention or a non-participant Control group. The intervention was an accelerated desensitization and adaptive attitudes (ADAA) treatment which involved stretch-tense, deep breath, release-relax and positive suggestion sequences to expedite anxiety reduction and also positive adaptive associations to each of eight learning, review, and testing scenes. The intervention was presented via a 31 minute recording, which students reviewed in five separate sessions over about half the school year. Test gains were calculated from the 2005 Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment tests (TCAPs) given after the intervention, adjusted for individual student 2004 TCAPs before the intervention. The Intervention group attained a significant seven percentile test gain over the Controls. The use of the recorded intervention is seen to vastly reduce the number of professional hours required for an anxiety-reduction program, and the program shows promise as a highly cost-effective means to benefit test-anxious students.

AB  - This study focused on the effects of administration mode (computer-adaptive test [CAT] versus self-adaptive test [SAT]), item-by-item answer feedback (present versus absent), and test anxiety on results obtained from computerized vocabulary tests. Examinees were assigned at random to 4 testing conditions (CAT with feedback, CAT without feedback, SAT with feedback, SAT without feedback). Examinees completed the Test Anxiety Inventory before taking their assigned computerized tests. Results show that the CATs were more reliable and took less time to complete than the SATs. Administration time for both the CATs and SATs was shorter when feedback was provided than when it was not, and this difference was most pronounced for examinees at medium to high levels of test anxiety. These results replicate prior findings regarding the precision and administrative efficiency of CATs and SATs but point to new possible benefits of including answer feedback on such tests.

AB  - Investigated the hypothesis that the previously found positive effects of self-adapted testing are attributable to examinees having an increased perception of control over a stressful testing situation. 377 students were randomly assigned to either (a) take a computerized adaptive test (CAT), (b) take a self-adapted test (SAT), or choose between taking a CAT or SAT. Results showed that the strongest preference for SAT was shown by examinees reporting high levels of math anxiety. Moreover, highly anxious examinees who were allowed to choose between the test types exhibited higher mean proficiency estimates than examinees who were assigned to test type.

AB  - This report examines how selection fairness is influenced by the characteristics of a selection instrument in terms of its distribution of item difficulties, level of item discrimination, degree of item bias, and testing strategy. Computer simulation was used in the administration of either a conventional or Bayesian adaptive ability test to a hypothetical target population consisting of a minority and majority subgroup. Fairness was evaluated by three indices which reflect the degree of differential validity, errors in prediction (Cleary's model), and proportion of applicants exceeding a selection cutoff (Thorndike's model). Major findings are: (1) when used in conjunction with either the Bayesian or conventional test, differential prediction increased fairness and facilitated the interpretation of the fairness indices; (2) the Bayesian adaptive tests were consistently fairer than the conventional tests for all item pools above the alpha=.7 discrimination level for tests of more than 30 items; (3) the differential prediction version of the Bayesian adaptive test produced almost perfectly fair performance on all fairness indices at high discrimination levels; and (4) the placement of subgroup prior distribution in the Bayesian adaptive testing procedure can affect test fairness.

AB  - Two types of computerized testing have been defined: (1) computer-based testing, using a computer to administer conventional tests in which all examinees take the same set of items; and (2) adaptive tests, in which items are selected for administration by the computer, based on examinee's previous responses. This paper discusses an option for classroom teachers that is easier to develop than a computerized adaptive test, but more secure and sophisticated than a computer-based test. The process of developing and pilot testing the computer-administered test and the results of a survey of student reactions are described. Subjects for the study consisted of 108 undergraduates taking summer educational technology courses in computer applications at a Southern university. Identical items were used for paper-and-pencil and computerized tests. No significant differences were found for either administration. Student responses indicated that: all of the students had familiarity with computers; 94% had no problems understanding the test directions; 53% initially experienced anxiety about taking the test on a computer; 89% indicated that the computer test was as fair as a paper test; and 61% indicated a preference for the computer test, while 19% indicated that both methods worked equally well. Four tables depict results for computerized tests versus paper-and-pencil tests; descriptive data for both kinds of tests; students' yes/no responses to the attitude survey; and examinee's comments regarding computerized testing.

AB  - During 1975-1979 this research into the potential of computerized adaptive testing to reduce errors in the measurement of human capabilities used Marine recruits for a live-testing validity comparison of computerized adaptive and conventional tests. The program purposes were to: (1) identify the most useful computer-based adaptive testing strategies; (2) identify testing conditions that maximize the positive rather than negative psychological effects of computerized testing; (3) investigate intra-individual multidimensionality problems in ability testing; (4) examine probabilistic responding and free-response methods for computerized adaptive testing in order to extract maximum information from each test item response; and (5) develop, refine and evaluate new computer administered ability tests for spacial, perceptive, memory, and other abilities not now measurable using paper and pencil testing. Monte Carlo and Bayesian adaptive testing methods were used in these studies. Fifteen major findings, primarily on adaptive testing and test administration conditions, and implications for further research are given. Abstracts of the 16 research reports for studies for this program are given. (BS)

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a modern alternative to classical paper and pencil testing. CAT is based on an automated selection of optimal item corresponding to current estimate of test-taker<e2><80><99>s ability, which is in contrast to fixed predefined items assigned in linear test. Advantages of CAT include lowered test anxiety and shortened test length, increased precision of estimates of test-takers<e2><80><99> abilities, and lowered level of item exposure thus better security. Challenges are high technical demands on the whole test work-flow and need of large item banks. In this study, we analyze feasibility and advantages of computerized adaptive testing using a Monte-Carlo simulation and post-hoc analysis based on a real linear admission test administrated at a medical college. We compare various settings of the adaptive test in terms of precision of ability estimates and test length. We find out that with adaptive item selection, the test length can be reduced to 40 out of 100 items while keeping the precision of ability estimates within the prescribed range and obtaining ability estimates highly correlated to estimates based on complete linear test (Pearson<e2><80><99>s $\rho$=0.96). We also demonstrate positive effect of content balancing and item exposure rate control on item composition.

AB  - Nanoelectronic circuits are increasingly affected by massive statistical process variations, leading to a paradigm shift in both design and test area. In circuit and system design, a broad class of methods for robustness like statistical design and self calibration has emerged and is increasingly used by the industry. The test community's answer to the massive-variation challenge is currently adaptive test. The test stimuli are modified on the fly (during test application) based on the circuit responses observed. The collected circuit outputs undergo statistical post-processing to facilitate pass/fail classification. We will present fundamentals of adaptive and robust test techniques and their theoretical background. While adaptive test is effective, the understanding how it covers defects under different process parameter combinations is not fully established yet with respect to algorithmic foundations. For this reason, novel analytic and algorithmic approaches in the field of variation-aware testing will also be presented in the tutorial. Coverage of defects in the process parameter space is modeled and maximized by an interplay between special fault simulation and multi-constrained ATPG algorithms. These systematic approaches can complement adaptive test application schemes to form a closed-loop system that combines analytical data with measurement results for maximal test quality.

AB  - The issue of competence assessment in engineering is analyzed in the context of the lack of motivation for learning. The source of this lack of motivation comes from the distribution of high school students. This assignment creates marginalization for a large number of students. Exit from marginalization can be accomplished through additional motivation. This is the responsibility of the competence assessment system. The proposed system is based on Bloom's taxonomy, with the questions being based on Bloom's verbs. It results an adaptive test system where questions are tailored to each individual's level of training. Another condition for generating motivation is to waive the confidentiality of ratings. The main argument is that this confidentiality supports mediocrity. A tonic competition is preferred. The author's experience demonstrates that this kind of competition is possible, especially using the gamefication. There is also the graphical image of the evolution of competence assessed, called the trajectory in the competence field. The results may have very close scores, but nevertheless the assessment can separate the full skills from the insufficient competencies without diminishing the motivating nature of the test itself.

AB  - High temperature and process variation are undesirable effects for modern systems-on-chip. The high temperature is a prominent issue during test and should be taken care of during the test process. Modern SoCs, affected by large process variation, experience rapid and large temperature deviations and, therefore, a traditional static test schedule which is unaware of these deviations will be suboptimal in terms of speed and/or thermal-safety. This paper presents an adaptive test scheduling method which addresses the temperature deviations and acts accordingly in order to improve the test speed and thermal-safety. The proposed method is divided into a computationally intense offline-phase, and a very simple online-phase. In the offline-phase a schedule tree is constructed, and in the online-phase the appropriate path in the schedule tree is traversed, step by step and based on temperature sensor readings. Experiments have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - Coevolution is the process of mutual adaptation of two populations. When a difficult optimization is performed with evolutionary computation, a population of adaptive test cases can strongly affect the progress of evolution. This study applies coevolution to the Tartarus task, a grid robot test problem. If the coevolving test cases are viewed as a form of parasite, then the question of virulence becomes an important feature of the algorithm. This study compares different types of parasites for the Tartarus problem. The impact of coevolution in this study is at odds with intuition and statistically significant. Analysis of the different types of coevolution suggests that disruptive crossover has a key effect. In the presence of disruptive crossover, coevolution may need to be modified to be effective. Examples of these modifications are presented. The key method of dealing with disruptive crossover is tracking the age of the Tartarus agents. The age of an agent is defined to be the number of selection steps the agent has survived. Using only older agents to drive coevolution of test cases substantially enhances the performance of one of the two type of coevolution studied.

A total number of 72 simulated optimal item pools were generated and evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. Results showed that the optimal item pools built with the p-optimality method provide sufficient measurement accuracy under all simulated MST panel designs. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but not the item distributions and item pool characteristics. This study demonstrated that the p-optimality method can adapt to MST item pool design, facilitate the MST assembly process, and improve its scoring accuracy.

AB  - As perfectly summarised by Ida Lawrence, "Testing is growing by leaps and bounds across the world. There is a realization that a nation's well-being depends crucially on the educational achievement of its population. Valid tests are an essential tool to evaluate a nation's educational standing and to implement efficacious educational reforms. Because tests consume time that otherwise could be devoted to instruction, it is important to devise tests that are efficient. Doing so requires a careful balancing of the contributions of technology, psychometrics, test design, and the learning sciences. Computer adaptive multistage testing (MSCAT) fits the bill extraordinarily well; unlike other forms of adaptive testing, it can be adapted to educational surveys and student testing. Research in this area will be an evidence that the methodologies and underlying technology that surround MSCAT have reached maturity and that there is a growing acceptance by the field of this type of test design" (from the Foreword to Y. Duanli, A. A. von Davier, & L. Charles (Eds.), "Computerized multistage testing: theory and application"). This state-of-the-art paper aims to present an overview of differential item functioning (DIF) in MSCAT using three-parameter logistic item response theory (IRT), offering suggestions to implement it in practice with a hope to motivate testing and assessment researchers and practitioners to initiate projects in this under-practiced area by helping them to better understand some of the relevant technical concepts.

AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

AB  - Decisions involved in designing high-stakes tests include whether to give examinees feedback and, if it is given, how to display the feedback to them. Researchers have yet to examine the effects of item response theory-related feedback on state test anxiety and examinees<e2><80><99> perceptions of fairness when said feedback is given on an item-by-item basis <e2><80><93> such as during a computer adaptive test. To address these gaps in the literature, this experiment examined the effects of feedback on state test anxiety and perceived test fairness, accounting for individual differences in feedback acceptance, exam performance, and performance goal orientation. These effects were examined across three modes of item-by-item feedback (i.e., text feedback, graphical feedback, and text/graphical feedback together) during a computer adaptive test in an online sample (N = 338). A three-way interaction occurred between text and graphical feedback, test performance, and prove performance goal orientation. As expected, among those who received feedback, there was a significant, positive relationship between feedback acceptance and perceived test fairness. Limitations and future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In recent years, many computerized test systems have been developed for diagnosing students<e2><80><99> learning profiles. Nevertheless, it remains a challenging issue to find an adaptive testing algorithm to both shorten testing time and precisely diagnose the knowledge status of students. In order to find a suitable algorithm, four adaptive testing algorithms, based on ordering theory, item relational structure theory, Diagnosys, and domain experts, were evaluated based on the training sample size, prediction accuracy, and the use of test items by the simulation study with paper-based test data. Based on the results of simulation study, ordering theory has the best performance. An ordering-theory-based knowledge-structure-adaptive testing system was developed and evaluated. The results of this system showed that the two different interfaces, paper-based and computer-based, did not affect the examinees<e2><80><99> performance. In addition, the effect of correct guessing was discussed, and two methods with adaptive testing algorithms were proposed to mitigate this effect. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods improve the effect of correct guessing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether the efficiency, precision, and validity of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) could be improved by assessing confidence differences in knowledge that examinees possessed. We proposed a novel polytomous CAT model called the confidence-weighting computerized adaptive testing (CWCAT), which combined a confidence-weighting scoring scheme with the graded response model (GRM). The CWCAT provided a more interactive testing environment by focusing on the examinees' confidence in their responses. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the comparison between the CWCAT and conventional CAT in terms of efficiency, precision, and validity. As expected, the polytomous method provided better discrimination among individual differences in the confidence in knowledge and required fewer items per examinee. Results also showed that CWCAT yielded ability estimates that were higher and better correlated to examinees' performance in English learning. Furthermore, the ability measured by CWCAT was not as likely to be affected by guessing as on conventional CAT, and, therefore, was more consistent with examinees' true ability.

AB  - Item response theory is a modern test theory. It focuses on the performance of each item. Under this framework, the performance of test takers on a test item can be predicted by a set of abilities. The relationship between the test takers' item performances and the set of abilities underlying item performances can be described by a monotonically increasing function called an item characteristic curve. Due to various personal reasons, the performances of the test takers may depart from the response patterns predicted by the underlying test model. In order to calculate the extent of departure of these aberrant response patterns, a number of methods have been developed under the theme "person-fit statistics". The degree of aberration is calculated as an index called person-fit index. Inside the computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test takers with different abilities will answer different numbers of questions and the difficulties of the items administered to them are usually clustered at the abilities of the test takers. Due to this reason, the application of person-fit indices in the computerized adaptive testing environment to measure misfit is difficult. When the frequent accesses to the item bank has become feasible, test takers may memorize blocks of test items and share these items with future test takers. Individuals with prior knowledge of some items may use that information to get high scores, in the sense that their test scores have been artificially inflated. FLOR is an index of posterior log-odds ratio used for detecting the use of item pre-knowledge. It can be applied both in the fixed item, fixed length test and the CAT environment. It is a model-based index in which aberrant models are defined in the situation of item pre-knowledge. FLOR describes the likelihood that a response pattern arises from the aberrant models. The present study used the hf plot to access the sensitivity of the person-fit indices. hf plot is a plot of hit rate against false alarm rate. For a higher hit rate, usually a higher false alarm rate is followed. hf plot provides a good tools for comparison between indices by inspection of the speed of rise of the curves. A sensitive index should give a faster rise of the curve. In this study, sensitivity of an index was defined as the speed of rise of the hf plot, which is represented by a parameter hf<cf><84> estimated from the data obtained from hf plot. The present study assessed the stability of FLOR over other variables, which were unrelated to item pre-knowledge. It found that FLOR was stable over the discrimination and difficulty parameters of test items. It was also stable over positions of the exposed items in the test and the initial assignment of prior probability of item pre-knowledge. However, the asymptotes (guessing factor) and the probabilities of item exposure did affect the final values of FLOR seriously. The present study also found that FLOR has a much superior sensitivity over other indices in detecting item pre-knowledge. Concerning about the sensitivity over different abilities of test takers, it was found that the sensitivity of FLOR was the highest among low ability test takers and the weakest among strong ability test takers in the fixed length and fixed items tests. However, the sensitivities of FLOR became the same among different abilities of test takers if items with difficulties matching their abilities were used in the tests. The number of beneficiaries among the test takers did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR. Moreover, in a simulation to test the differentiating power of FLOR, it was found that FLOR could differentiate item pre-knowledge from other reasons of personal misfits (test anxiety, player, random response and challenger) effectively. After the stability and sensitivity of FLOR were investigated, the application of it in the CAT environment had become the main concern. The present studies found that both the test length and the number of exposed items affect the final value of FLOR. In the fixed length CAT, the FLOR has a much stronger sensitivity than lz and CUSUM in detecting item pre-knowledge. The sensitivity of FLOR in the fixed length CAT was the same as that in the fixed length fixed items test. If the test length could vary, the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT would be slightly weakened. The Adjusted FLOR index could increase the sensitivity. Concerning about the effect of ability on the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT, it was found that the abilities of the test takers in CAT did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR and Adjusted FLOR.

AB  - The a-stratification procedure of item exposure control was designed to stratify items by item discrimination to ensure that an adaptive test would administer items from the entire range of items, not just the most-informative ones. An improvement to the a-stratification method, the a-stratification with b-blocking procedure added stratification according to item difficulty in order to take into account any correlation that might exist within the item pool between item discrimination and item difficulty. These procedures have been shown to work well using dichotomous items. This dissertation explored both stratification procedures using polytomous item pools to investigate whether or not an optimum number of strata could be implemented when administering polytomous computerized adaptive tests. In addition to the stratification procedures, two other exposure control conditions were studied. The randomesque procedure was used in one condition while a no exposure control condition served as a baseline condition. Items calibrated according to the generalized partial credit model were used to construct two item pools. Since the items covered three areas of science, content balancing procedures were incorporated to ensure that each adaptive test provided the appropriate balance of content. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate ability levels from simulated CATs. The number of strata used with both stratification procedures ranged from two to five, to ensure enough items per stratum. Along with descriptive statistics and correlations, bias and root mean squared error helped portray the accuracy of the simulated tests. Item exposure and item pool usage rates were used to show how much of the item pools were being used across administrations of the tests. Finally, item overlap rates were calculated to show how many of the same items were being used among simulated examinees of similar and different abilities. The results of this study did not reveal an optimum number of strata for the stratification procedures with either item pool. Furthermore, the randomesque procedure outperformed the stratification procedures in terms of item exposure and item overlap rates for both item pools. This surprising result was not affected by the number of strata used within the stratification procedures.

AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools that are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. In this paper, a test assembly model for the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools is presented. The model was motivated by Gullicksen's (1950) matched random subtests method. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of the Sympson and Hetter conditional procedure (SHC), a modification of the Sympson and Hetter (1985) algorithm, in controlling the exposure rates of items in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment. The properties of the procedure were compared with those of the Davey and Parshall (1995) and the Stocking and Lewis (1995) (SLC) conditional multinomial procedures within the purview of estimating examinee's abilities. Each of the exposure control methods was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed based on the CAT design established for this study. The advantages and disadvantages of these strategies were considered under four item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of test security, test overlap rates, utilization of the item pool, and conditional standard errors of measurement. Also, the issue of the appropriate conditional sample sizes in deriving the exposure control parameters was considered in the present study. Simulation results show no effect of using the four conditional sample sizes. The SHC produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates followed by the SLC method. Results also show that as long as the control for item exposure was not exercised, optimal items could be administered to almost every examinee under any of the four item pools. Findings of this study provide useful insights on how item pool sizes and maximum item exposure rates affect the performance of the exposure control methods.

AB  - This dissertation is concerned with item banks, more specifically, with the construction of them. Item banks are an essential piece in adaptive strategies of testing, as they are the item source for this kind of tests, the place from where the item(s) to be administered at each moment are selected. However, item bank development appears as a complex task that could be the reason of a reduced number of available item banks and, consequently, a limited application of adaptive tests in practice. These precedents have motivated the main goal of this dissertation: the development of a tool, that taking profit of computing power, supports the process of development and management of item banks. With it, it has been tried to do the development of item banks more efficient and, consequently, more accessible the renowned computerized adaptive tests. The main contribution of this work to satisfy this goal has come through the in-depth review of the whole process of building an item bank and the analysis of requirements of a program oriented to give support to the item bank development process. This program is referred in the thesis as BANKIT. With the former review emerged the meaning and implications of the different tasks involved in the building of item banks as well as the relationship between them, which has allowed to make clear what should be satisfied with BANKIT and set up the basis for the latter analysis. Available software, needs, tasks, attributes, data and functional analysis have made up the requirement analysis of this computerized system.

AB  - Research on the major computerized adaptive testing (CAT) strategies is reviewed, and some findings are reported that examine effects of examinee demographic and psychological characteristics on CAT strategies. In fixed branching strategies, all examinees respond to a common routing test, the score of which is used to assign examinees to a second-stage test. The currently popular statistically branched adaptive strategies are based on item-response theory, and include maximum likelihood strategy and Bayesian strategy. Two alternative strategies are the use of self-adapted testing and testlet strategies. Examinee characteristic variables are divided into: (1) demographic variables; (2) computer-use variables; (3) test-taking strategy variables; (4) cognitive characteristics; and (5) affective characteristics. Although research on the relationship between examinee psychological characteristics and CAT has been inconclusive, the basic findings are that examinees of different ethnic, gender, age, grade, ability, academic self-concept, test anxiety, computer anxiety, math anxiety, and computer experience groups are differentially affected by the adaptive testing strategies. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (Contains 67 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Purpose of study. This study was to determine if nursing candidates for licensure experienced an increase in anxiety due to the administration of an examination by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second purpose was to discover if certain groups were "at risk" of experiencing computer test anxiety. Method. This study was a two-group, experimental design conducted concurrently with the CAT-NCLEX simulation. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing selected practical nursing graduates and repeat examinees to participate in a field test of the Computerized Adaptive Testing of the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The experimental group for this study participated in the CAT simulation activity prior to taking NCLEX-PN and the control group did so after NCLEX-PN. Both groups completed a 17 item Self-Report Anxiety Questionnaire. The responses were summed; the total score was considered to be a measure of anxiety. Findings. Analysis of the data indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in computer test anxiety between the two groups. This is not to infer that there was no computer test anxiety expressed but rather that there was virtually no difference in the level of anxiety reported by the experimental group and the control group. Further analysis of data indicated that persons with previous computer experience reported higher levels of computer test anxiety than those without previous computer experience and that females reported themselves as experiencing higher levels of computer test anxiety than did males. The results did not indicate that minorities experienced higher levels of computer test anxiety than non-minority groups. Lastly, there was no correlation between nursing grade point average or age and levels of computer test anxiety. Conclusion. Participation in a computerized testing simulation did not affect the level of computer test anxiety. The only groups to experience higher levels of computer test anxiety are females and those with previous computer experience.

AB  - Item Response Theory (IRT) is a relatively recent development in psychometrics that has emerged as an attractive alternative to classical test theory. This is primarily a result of IRT's potential for solving many long standing measurement problems. One important and very promising application of IRT is Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). CAT is a procedure for administering tests which are individually tailored for each examinee. A CAT system uses a particular IRT model in combination with test item characteristics to estimate the examinee's ability. To date, all implementations of CATs have been built on models which require dichotomous scoring of test items. For the purpose of ability estimation these systems do not differentiate between an examinee's incorrect answer and other incorrect alternatives. In contrast to the IRT models presently used in CAT implementations, the Nominal Response Model utilizes the information in the pattern of wrong responses for ability estimation. No assumptions are made about a particular response being more correct than another. A Nominal Response Model-based CAT (nominal CAT) was implemented using real and simulated data. Comparisons were made between the nominal CAT's ability estimates and those of a CAT based upon the three-parameter logistic model (3PL CAT). In addition, estimates from the nominal CAT were compared with the known true ability estimates used to generate the simulated data. Results showed that the nominal CAT's ability estimates were highly correlated with those of the 3PL CAT as well as with the true abilities. Furthermore, the nominal CAT had a significantly higher association with the negative true abilities than did the 3PL CAT and it also had significantly lower standard errors of estimate than did the 3PL CAT. However, the nominal CAT had difficulty estimating positive abilities and had a poor convergence rate. In contrast, the 3PL CAT has a high convergence rate and its performance was not affected by whether the true abilities were positive or negative. Implications for computerized adaptive testing were discussed.

AB  - Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate score bias and information characteristics of Owen's Bayesian adaptive testing strategy, and to examine possible causes of score bias. Factors investigated in three related studies included effects of item discrimination, effects of fixed vs. variable test length, and effects of an accurate prior theta estimate. Data were generated from a three-parameter logistic model for 3,100 simulees in each of eight data sets; Bayesian adaptive tests were administered, drawing items from a "perfect" item pool. The results indicate that theta estimates from Owen's Bayesian adaptive testing method are affected by the prior theta estimate used and that the method does not provide measurements that are unbiased and equiprecise except under the unrealistic condition of an accurate prior theta estimate.

AB  - TAILOR is a computer program that uses the implied orders concept as the basis for computerized adaptive testing. The basic characteristics of TAILOR, which does not involve pretesting, are reviewed here and two studies of it are reported. One is a Monte Carlo simulation based on the four-parameter Birnbaum model and the other uses a matrix of children's item responses to the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. In the Birnbaum model study, a variety of conditions were simulated; it was found that TAILOR typically used responses to about half the items and achieved validities with the true score within a few points of the validity of the complete test. Item discrimination parameters affected the efficiency of TAILOR. The Binet study used correlations between scores based on one bank of tailored items and another independent, parallel set and found results similar to those in the Birnbaum simulation. TAILOR, like other adaptive testing systems, apparently can aid efficiency when item discriminations are high or when ability variance is large. (Author/MV)

AB  - ObjectivesTo assess: (1) the prevalence of mental health and substance use in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through use of a computer adaptive test (CATMH), (2) the correlation among CATMH scores and self and clinicianreported assessments, and (3) the association between CATMH scores and ED utilization in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment.MethodsThis was a singlecenter observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED for somatic complaints (97%) from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes were computeradaptiveassessed domains of suicidality, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We conducted Pearson correlations and logistic regression for objectives 2 and 3, respectively.ResultsFrom a sample of 794 patients, the proportion of those at moderate/severe risk was: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). CATMH domains were highly correlated with selfreport assessments (r =0.490.79). Individuals who had 2 or more ED visits in the prior year had 62% increased odds of being in the intermediatehigh suicide risk category (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.072.44) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. Individuals who scored in the intermediatehighsuicide risk group had 63% greater odds of an ED visit within 30 days after enrollment compared to those who scored as low risk (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.44).ConclusionThe CATMH documented that a considerable proportion of ED patients presenting for somatic problems had mental health conditions, even if mild. Mental health problems were also associated with ED utilization.

AB  - This paper presents improvements made to a computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-based version of the FCI (FCI-CAT) in regards to test security and test efficiency. First, we will discuss measures to enhance test security by controlling for item overexposure, decreasing the risk that respondents may (i) memorize the content of a pretest for use on the post-test or (ii) share information about the items with their classmates who take the assessment later. Second, we will discuss measures to enhance test efficiency, so that a shorter test length can yield a desired accuracy and precision of the measurement. Specifically, we utilized collateral information in the form of a pretest proficiency estimate of each respondent for selecting items and estimating respondent proficiency level in the post-test. To shorten the total testing time further, we also allowed the test lengths to be different for the pre- and post-test. To analyze how these improvements affect the accuracy and precision (which we measure in terms of root-mean-square error) of Cohen's d, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation and a "post hoc" simulation. Then, we calculated the minimal test length of the FCI-CAT whose accuracy and precision are equivalent to that of the paper-and-pencil version of the FCI. Consequently, we obtained the following three findings: (i) By using collateral information, we can achieve the accuracy and precision of the full-length FCI with fewer items via the FCI-CAT. (ii) For a class size of 40, we can control for test security while still reducing the sum of the pre- and post-test lengths of the FCI-CAT to a total of 33 items (17 items on the pretest and 16 items on the post-test), thereby reducing the testing time to 55%. (iii) If one's goal is to maximize test efficiency, the pretest length should be slightly larger than the post-test length. On the other hand, if the goal is to maximize test security, the pretest length should be smaller and the post-test length should be larger. If one desires a balance of these two goals, it would be reasonable to choose equal pre- and post-test lengths.

AB  - Objectives:The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used measure of perceived stress; however, minimal psychometric evaluation has been performed among Hispanic respondents, and even less among Hispanic caregivers to persons with Alzheimers disease and related disorders (ADRDs).Design:Secondary data analysis.Setting:New York City, NY, USA.Participants:A sample of 453 community dwelling Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD.Measurements:Latent variable models were used to evaluate the PSS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine unidimensionality. Differential item functioning (DIF) was examined for age, education, and language using the graded item response model.Results:The factor and bifactor analyses results supported essential unidimensionality of the item set; however, positively worded items were observed using response item theory to be less informative than the negatively worded items. Reliability estimates were high. Salient DIF was not observed for age, education, or language of interview using the primary DIF detection method. Sensitivity analyses using a second DIF detection method identified uniform language-DIF for the item, In the last month, how often have you felt that you were on top of things? However, the non-compensatory DIF value was below the threshold considered salient.Conclusions:In summary, the 10-item PSS performed well in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. Very little DIF, and none of high magnitude and impact, was observed. However, the negatively worded items, perhaps because they are more directly reflective of stress, were more informative. In the context of a short-form measure or computerized adaptive test, more informative items are those that would be selected for inclusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. METHOD: Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. RESULTS: We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. CONCLUSION: This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone<c2><a9> crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

AB  - CONTEXT: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. METHODS: Patients (ages 7-22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. RESULTS: Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

AB  - This thesis sought to address the application of non-parametric item response theory (NIRT) to cognitive and functional assessment in dementia. Performance on psychometric tests is key to diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. NIRT can be used to improve the psychometric properties of tests used in dementia assessment in multiple ways: confirming an underlying unidimensional structure, establishing formal item hierarchical patterns of decline, increasing insight by examining item parameters such as difficulty and discrimination, and creating shorter tests. From a NIRT approach item difficulty refers to the ease with which an item is endorsed. Discrimination is an index of how well an item can differentiate between patients of varying levels of severity. Firstly I carried out a systematic review to identify applications of both parametric and non-parametric IRT to measures assessing global cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This review demonstrated that IRT can increase the interpretive power of cognitive assessment scales and confirmed the limited number of IRT analyses of cognitive scales in dementia populations. This thesis extended this approach by applying Mokken scaling analysis to commonly used measures of current cognitive ability (Addenbrooke<e2><80><99>s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)) and of premorbid cognitive ability (National Adult Reading Test (NART)). Differential item functioning (DIF) by diagnosis identified slight variations in the patterns of hierarchical decline in the ACE-R. These disease-specific sequences of decline could serve as an adjunct to diagnosis, for example where learning a name and address is a more difficult task than being orientated in time, late onset Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease is a more probable diagnosis than mixed Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s and vascular dementia. These analyses also allowed key items to be identified which can be used to create briefer scales (mini-ACE and Mini-NART) which have good psychometric properties. These scales are clinically relevant, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items. They also allow sensitive measurement and adaptive testing and can reduce test administration time and patient stress. Impairment of functional abilities represents a crucial component of dementia diagnosis with performance on these functional tasks predictive of overall disease. A second aspect of this thesis, therefore, was the application of Mokken scaling analyses to measures of functional decline in dementia, specifically the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS). While gender DIF was observed for several items, implying the likelihood of equal responses from men and women is not equal a generally consistent pattern of impairment in functional ability was observed across different types of dementia.

AB  - Nursing programs increasingly use exit exams to increase graduating nursing students' readiness for the nurse licensing examination. These exams prepare students for computer adaptive testing and identify areas where remediation is needed. This study examines an Associate Degree in Nursing program that has shown consistently low exit exam scores causing delays in student graduation, eligibility to sit for the licensing exam, and entry into the workforce. The study was crafted to investigate student perspectives of the barriers to student success on the Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) exit exam. It employed a quantitative one-shot survey design to evaluate factors related to performance on the HESI exit exam, including lack of study time, lack of knowledge despite passing nursing courses, lack of motivation to prepare for the exam, overwhelming stress, poor test-taking skills, and lack of confidence. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that students' self-perceptions of poor test-taking skills had a significant negative effect on HESI exit exam scores. These findings were used to design a project focused on teaching test-taking skills throughout the nursing program. The study and project collectively promote positive social change by providing a means to improve nursing program graduation rates, a tool of great importance in addressing the current shortage of nurses in the United States' workforce.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to shed new light on the inconsistent relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining feedback type as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by feedback type. Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and feedback type also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used in a wide range of human resource and performance management instruments (e.g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/360<c2><b0> feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees<e2><80><99> reactions and rate of performance improvement.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that commonly manifests in the feet as pain, swelling and deformity. These symptoms often have extensive and severe mutlidimensional consequences for people's lives and can be evaluated using a class of subjective outcome measures known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs have been advocated by the Darzi report and are central to reforms in the NHS.Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a new and novel PROM, the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument (SAFE), using a clinimetric approach and featuring an adequately pre-tested nomothetic (fixed scale) and idiographic (patient-specific scale) assessment strategy. A mixed methods approach was employed to develop the SAFE, with the formulation and implementation of a four phase sequential exploratory fully mixed methods design (SEMMD) that featured equal priority between the qualitative and quantitative components.The four phase SEMMD enabled the strategic and effective combination of methods to produce a PROM that is firmly rooted in the views and experiences of people with feet affected by RA. The nomothetic scale of the SAFE has evidence for face, content and convergent validity (Spearman-Rank co-efficients: 0.62 - 0.80) and excellent one week test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.86 - 1.00 ). The idiographic scale has evidence for face and content validity.The SAFE is a tool for both clinical practice and clinical research. In order to realise the full potential of the SAFE, further research will be undertaken to refine, develop the PROM and integrate it into clinical practice. Initially, it will be necessary to demonstrate additional measurement properties for the nomothetic scale, including clinical interpretability and responsiveness and also necessary to demonstrate quantitative measurement properties for the idiographic scale. Long term, the SAFE will be redeveloped using item response theory and implemented as a computerised adaptive test.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which administers only items relevant to respondents<e2><80><99> ability, has the advantage of measuring persons<e2><80><99> ability precisely with considerably fewer items than traditional tests. CAT has been proposed for use in healthcare to reduce the respondents<e2><80><99>, administrators<e2><80><99> or researchers<e2><80><99> burden in clinics/clinical trials. However, there have been few studies in healthcare that have investigated the optimal characteristics of a CAT. The objective of my study was to investigate: (1) the psychometrics of an item bank measuring upper extremity (UE) disorders for CAT use, (2) how different testing procedures affect the ability estimates from CAT, and (3) whether CAT produce better ability estimates than a traditional static short assessment. The psychometrics of the item bank developed by combining items from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Upper Extremity Functional Index were examined by confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis across body part impairments (neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand). Repeated-measures MANOVA was used to investigate the standard error (SE) and bias of ability estimates from CAT with different testing procedures. Structural equation modeling was implemented to examine the correlations between ability estimates from the full test and different CAT structures and the full test with a short form. Further, paired-sample t test was performed to investigate the SE and bias of ability estimates from CAT and a static short form. In general, the item bank was found essentially unidimensional, the generalized partial credit model fit to the data better than partial credit model and there was no significant DIF. The ability estimates from CAT with expected a posteriori ability estimation method was found to be more precise and more comparable to those from full test than ability estimates derived from the maximum likelihood estimation. Further, CAT had better precision, comparability to full test and sensitivity to detect change than a static short form. The findings from this study suggest that UE CAT differ across estimations methods and are significantly better than a short form version. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In recent years, comparisons between computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and paper-and-pencil tests (P&Ps) have focused less on equivalency and more on the construct validity of shifting between the modalities. Examinee motivation is one area of concern, including test and computer anxiety. One type of motivation, flow, has a characteristic pattern of development similar to the pattern of item selection in CAT. Flow theory posits that positive reinforcement is gained through the sensation of achieving optimal performance. This study attempts to determine whether CAT facilitates flow in examinees, enabling them to perform better than on P&Ps. Covariates like test and computer anxiety, academic achievement, and certain personality traits are taken into account. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 94 middle-school CAT examinees to 65 middle-school P&P examinees on their responses to the Flow State Scale 2 (FSS-2), and regression modeling revealed a significant interaction between test modality and test anxiety on state flow, and significant effects for trait flow, typical study time, gender, and ethnicity when controlling for other covariates. Significant effects on specific flow dimensions were also found. The effect of flow on test performance was examined, but may have been limited by sample size. Reliability and dimensionality was confirmed for several instruments, some for the first time with an adolescent population: FSS-2, the Dispositional Flow Scale 2, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Test Anxiety Inventory-Short Form, and the Computer Attitude Scale. Interviews with students were also conducted to confirm the validity of measuring flow in testing situations. Implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - Computer-based testing is becoming popular with credentialing agencies because new test designs are possible and the evidence is clear that these new designs can increase the reliability and validity of candidate scores and pass/fail decisions. Research on MST to date suggests that the measurement quality of MST results is comparable to full-fledged computer-adaptive tests and improved over computerized fixed-form tests. MST's promise dwells in this potential for improved measurement with greater control than other adaptive approaches for constructing test forms. Recommending use of the MST design and advising how best to set up the design, however, are two different things. The purpose of the current simulation study was to advance an established line of research on MST methodology by enhancing understanding of how several important design variables affect outcomes for high-stakes credentialing. Modeling of the item bank, the candidate population, and the statistical characteristics of test items reflect an operational credentialing exam's conditions. Studied variables were module arrangement (4 designs), amount of overall test information (4 levels), distribution of information over stages (2 variations), strategies for between-stage routing (4 levels), and pass rates (3 levels), for 384 conditions total. Results showed that high levels of decision accuracy (DA) and decision consistency (DC) were consistently observed, even when test information was reduced by as much as 25%. No differences due to the choice of module arrangement were found. With high overall test information, results were optimal when test information was divided equally among stages; with reduced test information gathering more test information at Stage 1 provided the best results. Generalizing simulation study findings is always problematic. In practice, psychometric models never completely explain candidate performance, and with MST, there is always the potential psychological impact on candidates if test difficulty shifts are noticed. At the same time, two findings seem to stand out in this research: (1)<c2><a0>with limited amounts of overall test information, it may be best to capitalize on available information with accurate branching decisions early, and (2)<c2><a0>there may be little statistical advantage in exceeding test information much above 10 as gains in reliability and validity appear minimal.

AB  - Computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) is quickly becoming the test mode of choice among many high-stakes testing agencies. Although some researchers suggest that CAT is comparable, if not better, than traditional paper-and-pencil testing, others have suggested that individual differences among examinees have not been fully explored. In particular, the additional cognitive demands imposed by CAT are not well understood. For example, in the CAT mode there is the added demand of moving back and forth from computer screen to scrap paper when one has to solve more complex problems. In traditional paper and-pencil (P&P) testing environments, there is but one mode with which to contend: paper-and-pencil. In addition, CAT may generate greater anxiety<e2><80><94>which further increases cognitive load<e2><80><94>among some test-takers than would be found with more traditional testing modes. For example, with CAT you cannot go back to review previous items or change previous answers. And CAT requires something that is anxiety provoking in and of itself for some individuals: use of a computer. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects, particularly the cognitive effects, of different testing environments on individual test-taker experience. Forty undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions: CAT mode or P&P testing mode. All subjects took the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination. Methodology for the study included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil instruments, videotaped recording of subject behavior, observation, and interview. Verbal protocol analysis of subsamples of subjects' work-toward-solution behavior on two analytical reasoning problems was also included. Results of multivariate and univariate analyses suggest significant differences across test mode, with respect to cognitive demands. Compared to subjects in the paper-and-pencil test mode, CAT subjects had significantly longer response times on analytical reasoning (AR) problems, relied more on scrap paper to model AR problems diagrammatically, and employed different problem-solving strategies. Differences in affective responses<e2><80><94>including anxiety and frustration<e2><80><94>further suggest test mode effects were present. CAT subjects expressed significantly more frustration with the test mode than did their P&P counterparts. Furthermore, CAT subjects with low computer confidence experienced significantly higher levels of test anxiety than did their more computer-confident peers. Implications for test developers and recommendations for further research are offered.

AB  - This dissertation focused on the generation and evaluation of web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Memory and spatial visualization theory were explored in relation to the addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component. Analysis of the data determined that there was a significant difference between scores on the MRT Computer and MRT Memory test. The addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component did significantly affect results at the .05 alpha level. Reliability and discrimination estimates were higher on the MRT Memory version. The computerization of the paper and pencil version on the MRT did not significantly effect scores but did effect the time required to complete the test. The population utilized in the quasi-experiment consisted of 107 university students from eight institutions in engineering graphics related courses. The subjects completed two researcher developed, Web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the original paper and pencil version of the Mental Rotation Test. One version of the test included a visuo-spatial working memory loading. Significant contributions of this study included developing and evaluating computerized versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Previous versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test did not take advantage of the ability of the computer to incorporate an interaction factor, such as a visuo-spatial working memory loading, into the test. The addition of an interaction factor results in a more discriminate test which will lend itself well to computerized adaptive testing practices. Educators in engineering graphics related disciplines should strongly consider the use of spatial visualization tests to aid in establishing the effects of modern computer systems on fundamental design/drafting skills. Regular testing of spatial visualization skills will result assist in the creation of a more relevant curriculum. Computerized tests which are valid and reliable will assist in making this task feasible. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

AB  - Whether the presence of bidimensionality has any effect on the adaptive recalibration of test items was studied through live-data simulation of computer adaptive testing (CAT) forms. The source data were examinee responses to the 298 scored multiple choice items of a licensure examination in a health care profession. Three 75-item part-forms, differing in the degree of bidimensionality, were constructed from the examination forms. The dimensionality of each item was determined based on principal factor loadings using W. F. Stout's (1987) procedure. Samples of 2,100 examinees from an U.S.-educated group and a predominantly foreign-educated group were used, with samples sizes of 100, 200, 400, and 1,000 used for the analyses. As expected, an increase in sample size resulted in greater agreement between calibration and bank b-values. It appeared that dimensionality affected adaptive recalibration. Results from this study varied depending on the dimensionality of the part-forms. Results also affirm the importance of a well-defined reference group for recalibration, since samples from varying ability ranges sometimes produced considerably different b-values. Three tables present details of the analyses. (Contains six references.) (SLD)

AB  - This dissertation examined the feasibility of using computer adaptive technology to administer certification examinations. The agenda for this research was (1) to compare a computer adaptive test (CAT) with paper and pencil (PAP) tests in terms of the comparability of item calibrations and the comparability of examinee ability estimates and (2) to examine the CAT under varying test conditions to determine whether modifications in traditional test design affect examinee performance. Results show that PAP item calibrations were functionally equivalent to the CAT item calibrations even though items on the CAT were administered to varying numbers of examinees and appeared in different contexts for different examinees. Examinees performed comparably on the CAT and the PAP as evidenced by a.83 correlation, adjusted for measurement error, and a mean difference of.01 across the two modes of administration. There were no significant differences between the CAT and the PAP ability estimates due to sex, ethnic origin, age or whether or not English was the examinee's first language. On the CAT, examinees were randomly placed in test design conditions in which the effects of altering the difficulty of the start, the difficulty of the test, the minimum test length and the option to skip, defer or review items were examined. There were no significant differences in examinee performance across these groups indicating that some of these design options may be viable for CAT. Test length was reduced on the CAT without sacrificing confidence in the pass/fail decision. Test length on the PAP was 109 items; mean test length on the CAT was 66 items when the maximum test length was set at 100 items and 86 items when the maximum test length was set at 240 items. Results from this study indicate that CAT can be an excellent way to administer certification exams. Examinees can benefit by being able to take shorter exams, scheduled at their convenience and receive immediate test results. For the certification board, CAT can improve data collection and test security, and provide greater confidence in pass/fail decisions.

AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

AB  - The shear strength of remolded specimens of an unsaturated, silty, copper tailings sand was measured in a triaxial apparatus. Multistage tests were completed under consolidated-drained (CD) conditions, where both the pore air and pore water pressures were controlled, and under constant water content (CW) conditions, where the specimen was drained with respect to the pore air pressure and undrained with respect to the pore water pressure. A triaxial testing system with automatic data capturing capabilities was assembled for the study. A total of eight specimens were tested, two in a saturated condition and three each under unsaturated CD and CW conditions, respectively. The saturated specimens were staged with respect to increasing effective stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$), while each unsaturated specimen was tested with a constant value of net applied stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$), and increasing values of matric suction (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) from stage to stage. The range of net applied stress and matric suction studied was 15 to 150 kPa. The parameter $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ quantifies the increase in shear strength which can be attributed to the matric suction stress state variable. The results indicated that the intersection of the failure surface with the plane containing the (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) axis was curved over the range of suction studied, and did not differ appreciably between the CD and CW test methods. This demonstrated uniqueness of the failure surface. When account was made for a slight curvature in the failure surface in the direction of the ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$) axis, the variation in $\phi\sp\prime$ with respect to (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) was reduced. This supported the concept of independence of the shear strength parameters $\phi\sp\prime$, c$\sp\prime$, and $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ for unsaturated soils, and verified the form of the shear strength equation used in the study (Fredlund, Morgenstern, and Widger, 1978).

AB  - Feedback is a key element in the teaching/learning cycle. It tells teachers and students how they are progressing and how effective their instruction/learning has been. Despite the importance of feedback, it is rarely obtained in optimal ways and is poorly understood by teachers and students. The problem lies in ineffective methods of obtaining and utilizing feedback information. This study has attempted to define, implement, and determine the effects of a set of rational measurement practices. It is based on the premise that testing should be an integral part of teaching, providing information to students and teachers in an efficient and non-intrusive manner. The components for rational measurement include well-written item sets which communicate teachers'expectations to students, individualized selection of items, detailed comments on student answers, and reports portraying the changing relationship of students to items as instruction proceeds. The system utilizes a microcomputer programmed with an algorithm for Rasch measurement and adaptive testing. Nine classes participated in a study of the effectiveness of the system. After training, each teacher wrote item sets corresponding to two units. Qualitative data were gathered on teachers' use of measurement information for improving teaching practice. Teacher proficiency in writing items was measured. Students within classes were randomly assigned to four groups created by the crossing of a feedback factor and an item selection factor. Students were tested weekly with subsets of items from the set written by the teacher. Ability measures were obtained from each session to determine whether detailed feedback was effective in raising achievement. Attitude and anxiety data were collected at the beginning and end of each unit to assess whether adaptive item selection caused a more positive student reaction to testing. Data analysis showed that four teachers used the system to improve their teaching. Three teachers displayed positive verbal responses, but did not change practices. Two teachers did not use the measurement information. There was no discernible increase in item-writing proficiency. Analysis of student data showed a nonsignificant positive effect of detailed feedback on student achievement. No difference between selection or feedback groups was observed for any affective measures.

AB  - <c2><a0> IMPORTANCE: Veterans from recent and past conflicts have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5. RESULTS: Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic screening and severity measurement are possible. [Author Abstract]

AB  - Background: Quality of life (QoL) assessments, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), are becoming increasingly important in health care and have been associated with improved decision making, higher satisfaction, and better outcomes of care. Some physicians and patients may find questionnaires too burdensome; however, this issue could be addressed by making use of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In addition, making the questionnaire more interesting, for example by providing graphical and contextualized feedback, may further improve the experience of the users. However, little is known about how shorter assessments and feedback impact user experience. Objective: We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the impact of tailored multimodal feedback and CAT on user experience in QoL assessment using validated PROMs. Methods: We recruited a representative sample from the general population in the United Kingdom using the Oxford Prolific academic Web panel. Participants completed either a CAT version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-CAT) or the fixed-length WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100. We randomly assigned participants to conditions in which they would receive no feedback, graphical feedback only, or graphical and adaptive text-based feedback. Participants rated the assessment in terms of perceived acceptability, engagement, clarity, and accuracy. Results: We included 1386 participants in our analysis. Assessment experience was improved when graphical and tailored text-based feedback was provided along with PROMs (<ce><94> = 0.22, P < .001). Providing graphical feedback alone was weakly associated with improvement in overall experience (<ce><94> = 0.10, P = .006). Graphical and text-based feedback made the questionnaire more interesting, and users were more likely to report they would share the results with a physician or family member (<ce><94> = 0.17, P < .001, and <ce><94> = 0.17, P < .001, respectively). No difference was found in perceived accuracy of the graphical feedback scores of the WHOQOL-CAT and WHOQOL-BREF (<ce><94> = 0.06, P = .05). CAT (stopping rule [SE < 0.45]) resulted in the administration of 25% fewer items than the fixed-length assessment, but it did not result in an improved user experience (P = .21). Conclusions: Using tailored text-based feedback to contextualize numeric scores maximized the acceptability of electronic QoL assessment. Improving user experience may increase response rates and reduce attrition in research and clinical use of PROMs. In this study, CAT administration was associated with a modest decrease in assessment length but did not improve user experience. Patient-perceived accuracy of feedback was equivalent when comparing CAT with fixed-length assessment. Fixed-length forms are already generally acceptable to respondents; however, CAT might have an advantage over longer questionnaires that would be considered burdensome. Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between assessment length, feedback, and response burden in diverse populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice (EBBP) is a transdisciplinary systematic approach that emphasizes the use of best evidence in combination with clinical expertise, as well as patient preferences and values, to make clinically-informed decisions about care and treatment (Spring, 2007). Despite numerous benefits and strong policy support of EBBP, findings indicate that clinicians generally fail to implement EBBP in standard clinical practice due to a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and low self-efficacy associated with an absence of resources. To address the need for EBBP resources and tools, Bonnie Spring, PhD and colleagues developed a theory-driven website for graduate students and clinicians. The website is primarily comprised of two components: nine interactive training modules and a novel assessment portal that utilizes patient-reported computer adaptive tests (CATs). To date, the training modules and assessment portal have not been evaluated, and there is currently a critical need to incorporate mixed methods evaluations into EBBP implementation science. The goal of this dissertation is to contribute to the ongoing evaluation and optimization of the EBBP Project by conducting summative and implementation-focused formative evaluations of its training modules and assessment portal. Aim 1 evaluated changes in user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy for each EBBP module and determined whether these outcomes varied by user characteristics, including degree, professional discipline, and number of completed modules. Together, findings suggested heightened interest and use of asynchronous, web-based training modules about EBBP in social work and psychology, and that these modules can produce short-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about EBBP. Overall, however, attrition continues to be a challenge. To better understand the attrition rates of the EBBP training modules and web-based modules, in general, Aim 2 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics related to module engagement. Overall, findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses (i.e., mixed method analyses) revealed that specific instructional guidance and interactive features, coupled with user technical knowledge, are particularly important characteristics that may improve engagement in asynchronous web-based training modules. Given the novelty of the EBBP assessment portal, Aim 3 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics associated with its engagement and implementation. Results from mixed method analyses suggested that user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy, coupled with programmatic functions to ensure privacy and confidentiality of patient information, may be important characteristics to improving engagement with a CATs-based assessment portal. In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information on the short-term effectiveness of asynchronous web-based modules, and factors that may contribute to engagement and implementation of online training and clinical tools for EBBP.

AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), structured in Itens Banks, provides a new tool for evaluating results that apply to various chronic diseases through advanced statistical techniques (TRI) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The aim of this study was to culturally adapt the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of PROMIS to the Portuguese language. The process followed the recommendations of PROMIS through the advanced translation, reconciliation, back-translation, FACIT review, independent review, finalization, pre-test, and incorporation of the results from the pre-test. The translated version was pre-tested in ten patients, and items 3, 46, and 53 of the Bank of Anxiety and item 46 of the bank of Depression had to be changed. Changes affected equivalence of meaning, and the final version was consistent with the Brazilian population's linguistic and cultural skills. In conclusion, for the Brazilian population the translated version proved semantically and conceptually equivalent to the original. Adapted from the source document

AB  - The main purpose of manufacturing test has been and continues to be to separate good integrated circuits (ICs) from ones that do not meet the desired operational characteristics. An ideal testing procedure should pass all good chips and fail all those that do not deliver the required functionality. However, a defective chip may pass all the tests, which leads to reduction in product quality. Product quality is commonly measured using defect level, which is the ratio of defective chips in all the chips that pass all tests. Defect level is typically expressed in units of defective parts per million shipped (DPPM). A variety of test sets derived using different test metrics are usually applied to ensure an acceptable quality level. However, various experiments involving actual ICs have shown that a significant portion of the test patterns applied do not contribute to the improvement in product quality, which indicates the possibility of significantly reducing the cost of test without affecting product quality, or alternatively improving product quality without incurring additional test cost. In this dissertation, a diagnosis-assisted adaptive test (DAT) method for improving test quality is described, developed, and validated. DAT uses diagnosis to capture the failure characteristics on a per-design basis and improves test quality by changing the test set to match the current failure characteristics. DAT uses (i) a multiple defect diagnosis method, referred to as MD2X, which is flexible in handling various defect behaviors, and (ii) a failing behavior identification (FBI) method that captures defect behavior by identifying signal lines related to defect activation. MD2X is evaluated using logic simulation experiments. Results from over 5,700 simulated and 131 failing ICs show that MD 2X can effectively diagnose circuits that are affected by a large (>20) or small number of defects of various types. Specifically, when diagnosing circuits with more than 20 defects, MD2X identifies 74% of them. For circuits affected by two defects, the number changes to 87%. This level of diagnosis accuracy for ICs of this type exceeds all claims currently found in the literature. The efficacy of FBI is validated using circuit- and logic-level simulation experiments. The results show that FBI achieves an average accuracy of 94% in identifying signal lines that are relevant to defect activation, a 28% improvement over prior art. DAT is validated using circuit-level simulation experiments and experiments involving real IC fail data. Circuit-level simulation involving various types of defects shows that defect level can be reduced by 30% using DAT. In addition, a new cost-efficient framework for evaluating test quality using tester data from failing ICs, which we call FETQ, has also been developed. FETQ is used to evaluate the quality of tests based on DAT. Among the test sets of the same size, the test set generated using DAT detects the most failing chips, and it uniquely fails one defective chip that is not detected by any of the test sets that are generated based on stuck-at, bridge, and input-pattern fault models. The test quality of DAT test sets is also compared with the original one used in production. The result shows that DAT test sets detect more failing chips with the same number of test patterns, or alternatively, the same number of failing chips could be detected using significantly fewer tests.

AB  - In this guide, the authors outline the advantages of online eAssessment and examine the intellectual, technical, legal and cost issues that arise from its use. This guide outlines the major assessment types that are suitable for online assessment and makes a key distinction between formative and summative assessment. The focus is primarily on the latter since that is where the difficulties are most acute and robust systems most critical. A range of practical issues relating to the key stages in running a summative e-exam are explored and advice given on system requirements and on how to ensure that the exam runs smoothly when you 'go live'. This section includes consideration of the way that using eAssessment might affect the standard setting and results analysis process. The section on future trends in online assessment explores possibilities such as computer adaptive testing and the automated assessment of free text answers. Finally, there is a consideration of the implications of these trends for management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the last 20 years, several authors have described the possible changes that computers may effect in language testing. Since Annual Review of Applied Linguistics's last review of general language testing trends (Clapham, 2000), authors in the Cambridge Language Assessment Series have offered various visions of how computer technology could alter the testing of second language skills. This chapter reflects these perspectives as it charts the paths recently taken in the field. Initial steps were made in the conversion of existing item types & constructs already known from paper-&- pencil testing into formats suitable for computer delivery. This conversion was closely followed by the introduction of computer-adaptive tests, which aim to make more, & perhaps better, use of computer capabilities to tailor tests more closely to individual abilities & interests. Movement toward greater use of computers in assessment has been coupled with an assumption that computer-based tests should be better than their traditional predecessors, & some steps towards this end have been taken. Corpus linguistics has provided tools to create more authentic assessments; the quest for authenticity has also motivated inclusion of more complex tasks & constructs. Both these innovations have begun to be incorporated into computer-based language tests. Natural language processing has also provided some tools for computerized scoring of essays, particularly relevant in large-scale language testing programs. Although computer use has not revolutionized all aspects of language testing, recent efforts have produced some of the research & technological advances & have improved pedagogical understanding needed to support progress.

AB  - A survey of some of the issues in assessing second-language listening ability discusses & evaluates some of the methods & techniques used, & potential applications. Noting the inadequacy of current models, the common themes of skills hierarchies & listening as an interactive process dominate current research approaches. Major research issues are identified as (1) assessing higher level listening skills, (2) confounding of skills, (3) assessing listening in oral interaction, & (4) dealing with authenticity. Assessment tasks are constructed with focus on the factors affecting test performance & the practical issues of test construction. The potential of computer-adaptive assessment, computer-based dictation, & computer-adaptive tests with interactive capabilities are noted, as well as the use of video, underlining the importance of visual support for listening. An annotated bibliography is included. 71 References. B. Gadalla

AB  - This study estimated male-female and Black-White achievement gaps without accounting for low test motivation, then compared those estimates to ones that used several approaches to addressing rapid guessing. Researchers investigated two issues: (1) The differences in rates of rapid guessing across subgroups and (2) How much achievement gap estimates change when rapid guessing is addressed. The study used reading and mathematics scores from the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), a test administered in nearly all U.S. states. Results suggest that rapid guessing occurs at very different rates across subgroups. However, rapid guessing generally has a mild effect on gaps estimates, although there are cases where failing to account for low test motivation may be impacting fundamental inferences made based on gaps. As part of the second question, differences across approaches to accounting for rapid guessing were examined. Results suggest that rapid guessing occurs at very different rates across subgroups. However, rapid guessing generally has a mild effect on gaps estimates, although there are cases where failing to account for low test motivation may be impacting fundamental inferences made based on gaps.

AB  - The ability to screen quickly and thoroughly for psychological difficulties in existing and returning combat veterans who are seeking treatment for physical ailments would be of significant benefit. In the current study, item and time savings, as well as extratest correlations, associated with an audio-augmented version of the computerized adaptive Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2-CA) are examined in a group of 273 male veterans, ages 26-87 years. Results indicated an average item savings of approximately 103 items (18.6%), with a corresponding time savings of approximately 12 min (24.3%), for the MMPI-2-CA compared with conventional computerized administration of the test, as well as comparability in terms of test-retest coefficients and correlations with external measures. Future directions of adaptive personality testing are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  - In self-adapted testing, examinees are allowed to choose the difficulty of each item to be presented immediately before attempting it. Previous research has demonstrated that self-adapted testing leads to better performance than do fixed-order tests and is preferred by examinees. The present study examined the strategies that 29 college students used in selecting items during a self-adapted test. After completing the Test Anxiety Inventory, subjects took the self-adapted test. The test contained 40 items sorted into 8 categories of difficulty based on Rasch model estimates. Three test-taking strategies were identified. Most subjects adopted a flexible strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and harder items following success. Some subjects adopted a "failure intolerant" strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and items of the same difficulty after success. Finally, some subjects adopted a "failure tolerant" strategy in which they chose items of the same difficulty level after failure, but harder items after success. The failure-tolerant strategy was associated with lower estimated ability than were the other two strategies. This finding may reflect the attributions examinees adopting that strategy make and the effort they expend following failures. The results provide general support for the value of continued development of self-adapted testing. (Author/TJH)

AB  - This article introduces a blocked-design procedure for cognitive diagnosis computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT), which allows examinees to review items and change their answers during test administration. Four blocking versions of the new procedure were proposed. In addition, the impact of several factors, namely, item quality, generating model, block size, and test length, on the classification rates was investigated. Three popular item selection indices in CD-CAT were used and their efficiency compared using the new procedure. An additional study was carried out to examine the potential benefit of item review. The results showed that the new procedure is promising in that allowing item review resulted only in a small loss in attribute classification accuracy under some conditions. Moreover, using a blocked-design CD-CAT is beneficial to the extent that it alleviates the negative impact of test anxiety on examinees<e2><80><99> true performance.

AB  - Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) includes the advantages of both cognitive diagnosis (CD) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which can offer detailed diagnosis feedback for each examinee by applying fewer test items and time. It has been a promising field. An item bank is a prerequisite for the implementation of CD-CAT. However, its maintenance is a very challenging task. One of the effective ways to maintain the item bank is online calibration. Till now, there are only a few online calibration methods in the CD-CAT context that can calibrate Q-matrix and item parameters simultaneously. Moreover, the computational efficiency of these methods needs to be further improved. Therefore, it is crucial to find more online calibration methods that jointly calibrate the Q-matrix and item parameters. Inspired by the SIE (Single-Item Estimation) method proposed by Chen et al. (2015) and information gain feature selection criteria in feature selection, an information gain of entropy-based online calibration method (IGEOCM) was proposed in this study. The proposed method can jointly calibrate Q-matrix and item parameters in a sequential manner. The calibration process of the new items was described as follows: First, for the new item j, the q-vector can be calibrated by maximizing the information gain of entropy-based on the basis of the attribute patterns of examinees and the examinees<e2><80><99> responses to item j. Second, the item parameters of the new item j are estimated by the EM algorithm based on the posterior distribution of examinees<e2><80><99> attribute pattern, the examinees<e2><80><99> responses to item j, and the q-vector estimated in the first step. The first and second step are repeated for all other new items to obtain their estimated Q-matrix and item parameters item by item. Two simulation studies were conducted to examine whether the IGEOCM could accurately and efficiently calibrate the Q-matrix and item parameters of the new items under different calibration sample sizes (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200), different attribute pattern distributions (uniform distribution, higher-order distribution, and multivariate normal distribution), the different number of new items answered by examinee (4, 6, and 8), and different item selection algorithms (posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler, PWKL; the modified PWKL, MPWKL; the generalized deterministic inputs, noisy and gate model discrimination index, GDI; and Shannon entropy, SHE). Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method was compared with the SIE, SIE-R-BIC, and RMSEA-N methods. The results indicated that (1) The IGEOCM worked well in terms of the calibration accuracy and estimation efficiency under all conditions, and outperformed the SIE, SIE-R-BIC, and RMSEA-N methods overall. (2) The accuracy of the item calibration increases as the sample size increases for all calibration methods under all conditions. (3) The SIE, SIE-R-BIC, RMSEA-N, and IGEOCM performed better under the uniform distribution and higher-order distribution than under the multivariate normal distribution. (4) The number of new items answered by the examinee had a negligible impact on the calibration accuracy and computation efficiency of the SIE, SIE-R-BIC, RMSEA-N, and IGEOCM. (5) The item selection algorithm in CD-CAT affects the Q-matrix calibration accuracy of the SIE and IGEOCM methods. Under the higher-order distribution and multivariate normal distribution, the SIE method and IGEOCM had higher Q-matrix calibration accuracy when the item selection algorithms were MPWKL and GDI. On the whole, although the proposed IGEOCM is competitive and outperforms the conventional method irrespective of the calibration precision or computational efficiency, the studies on the online calibration method in CD-CAT still need to be further deepened and expanded.

AB  - Proposed for the 11th edition of the World Health Organization<e2><80><99>s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) is a dimensional trait model for the classification of personality disorder (Tyrer, Reed, & Crawford, 2015). The ICD-11 proposal consists of 5 broad domains: negative affective, detachment, dissocial, disinhibition, and anankastic (Mulder, Horwood, Tyrer, Carter, & Joyce, 2016). Several field trials have examined this proposal, yet none has included a direct measure of the trait model. The purpose of the current study was to develop and provide initial validation for the Personality Inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD), a self-report measure of this proposed 5-domain maladaptive trait model. Item selection and scale construction proceeded through 3 initial data collections assessing potential item performance. Two subsequent studies were conducted for scale validation. In Study 1, the PiCD was evaluated in a sample of 259 MTurk participants (who were or had been receiving mental health treatment) with respect to 2 measures of general personality structure: The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire<e2><80><94>Revised and the 5-Dimensional Personality Test. In Study 2, the PiCD was evaluated in an additional sample of 285 participants with respect to 2 measures of maladaptive personality traits: The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 and the Computerized Adaptive Test for Personality Disorders. Study 3 provides an item-level exploratory structural equation model with the combined samples from Studies 1 and 2. The results are discussed with respect to the validity of the measure and the potential benefits for future research in having a direct, self-report measure of the ICD-11 trait proposal.

AB  - To test whether allaying the anxiety of older Ss in taking intelligence tests significantly raises scores, 30 Ss matched for age, education, and IQ were retested by the WAIS: <c2><bd> by conventional methods and <c2><bd> by the 'adaptive' method. This technique involved beginning each test with an item below the S's anticipated mental level and alternating easy and hard items from the scale or a pool of similar items. The increase in scores from using the adaptive method was significantly greater than increase from retesting by the consecutive method. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) aims to develop self-reported item banks for clinical research. The PROMIS pediatrics (aged 8<e2><80><93>17) project focuses on the development of item banks across several health domains (physical function, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, social role relationships, and asthma symptoms). The psychometric properties of the anxiety and depressive symptom item banks are described. Methods: Participants (n = 1,529) were recruited in public school settings, hospital-based outpatient and subspecialty pediatrics clinics. The anxiety (k = 18) and depressive symptoms (k = 21) items were split between two test administration forms. Hierarchical confirmatory factor-analytic models (CFA) were conducted to evaluate scale dimensionality and local dependence. IRT analyses were then used to finalize item banks and short forms. Results: CFA results confirmed that anxiety and depressive symptoms are separate constructs and indicative of negative affect. Items with local dependence and DIF were removed resulting in 15 anxiety and 14 depressive symptoms items. The psychometric differences between short forms and simulated computer adaptive tests are presented. Conclusions: PROMIS pediatric item banks were developed to provide efficient assessment of health-related quality of life domains. This sample provides initial calibrations of anxiety and depressive symptoms item banks and creates PROMIS pediatric instruments, version 1.0.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a National Institutes of Health initiative to develop item banks measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and to create and make available a computerized adaptive testing system (CAT) that allows for efficient and precise assessment of PROs in clinical research and practice. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This paper provides an overview of PROMIS and its application to mental health research. METHODS: The PROMIS methodology for item bank development and testing is described, with a focus on the implications of this work for mental health research. RESULTS: Utilizing qualitative item review and state-of-the-art applications of item response theory (IRT), PROMIS investigators have developed, tested, and released item banks measuring physical, mental, and social health components. Ongoing efforts continue to add new item banks and further validate existing banks. DISCUSSION: PROMIS provides item banks measuring several domains of interest to mental health researchers including emotional distress, social function, and sleep. PROMIS methodology also provides a rigorous standard for the development of new mental health measures. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION: Web-based CAT or administration of short forms derived from PROMIS item banks provide efficient and precise dimensional estimates of clinical outcomes that can be utilized to monitor patient progress and assess quality improvement. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Use of the dimensional PROMIS metrics (and co-calibration of the PROMIS item banks with existing PROs) will allow comparisons of mental health and related health outcomes across disorders and studies.

AB  - The purpose of this text is to help current and future workers in the helping professions become better consumers of psychological and educational tests and assessment procedures. The book focuses on seven components. [1] 'Models for test use and selection.' The first chapter presents several models to provide a framework for conceptualizing when to use tests and why. [2] 'Basic competencies needed.' Chapters 2 through 5 identify the basic measurement, statistical, and research skills needed to select, administer, and interpret tests and assessment information. [3] 'Types of tests and assessment procedures.' Chapters 6 through 11 introduce the different types of test and assessment techniques that are commonly used in the helping professions. [4] 'Test takers and their needs.' Chapters 12 through 15 concern test takers and their needs. These chapters address text anxiety, test-taking skills, assessment of individuals with special needs, and computer-assisted and computer-adaptive testing. [5] 'Test administrators and their roles.' Chapters 16 through 19 look at the roles and problems of the test administrator. The validity and reliability of test results depend in part upon the skill of the examiner, who must not only administer and score the test but also interpret and disseminate the results. [6] 'Test utilization in different settings.' Chapters 20 to 22 look at how tests and assessment procedures are used in different contexts, specifically education, industry and mental health. [7] 'Current issues and trends.' The last chapter recapitulates some of the major trends and issues introduced in the text and predicts some future directions.

AB  - The speech materials themselves can have a large effect on intelligibility. The lexical status of the words, the grammatical complexity of the utterances, and the length of the utterances all affect intelligibility. The characteristics of the materials when they are spoken can also affect intelligibility. These characteristics include the phonetic similarity of the words, the speaking rate and clarity of the speaker, the naturalness of the speaker's voice, the speaker's gender, and the speaker's dialect. The spectral and temporal energetic properties of non-speech maskers can have a large effect on intelligibility. If the masker is other speech, these energetic properties, as well as the informational properties of the masker, also come into play. A solution to the problems is found in the use of a different stationary masking noise for each language. The spectrum of this masker is matched to the long term average spectrum (LTAS) of the talker's voice for each language. The reflection of sound from the surfaces of an enclosed space, or reverberation, can produce measurable degradation of speech intelligibility in noise via two mechanisms. Acoustic effects of the test environment on sound field HINT scores are most problematic when an individual's scores are to be placed on the absolute scale of speech intelligibility by reference to the norms for the relevant test condition. One of the major advantages of adaptive tests is that they can measure an attribute of interest over a range that includes both normal and impaired function. In the following short reports, relevant details about the development and normalization of the HINT materials in each language are provided.

AB  - Background: Better understanding of acute stress responses is important for revision of DSM-5. However, the latent structure and relationship between different aspects of acute stress responses haven<e2><80><99>t been clarified comprehensively. Bifactor item response model may help resolve this problem. Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop a statistical model of acute stress responses, based on data from earthquake rescuers using Acute Stress Response Scale (ASRS). Through this model, we could better understand acute stress responses comprehensively, and provide preliminary information for computerized adaptive testing of stress responses. Methods: Acute stress responses of earthquake rescuers were evaluated using ASRS, and state/trait anxiety were assessed using State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). A hierarchical item response model (bifactor model) was used to analyze the data. Additionally, we tested this hierarchical model with model fit comparisons with one-dimensional and five-dimensional models. The correlations among acute stress responses and state/trait anxiety were compared, based on both the five-dimensional and bifactor models. Results: Model fit comparisons showed bifactor model fit the data best. Item loadings on general and specific factors varied greatly between different aspects of stress responses. Many symptoms (40%) of physiological responses had positive loadings on general factor, and negative loadings on specific factor of physiological responses, while other stress responses had positive loadings on both general and specific factors. After extracting general factor of stress responses using bifactor analysis, significant positive correlations between physiological responses and state/trait anxiety (r = 0.185/0.112, p < 0.01) changed into negative ones (r = <e2><88><92>0.177/<e2><88><92>0.38, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Our results demonstrated bifactor structure of acute stress responses, and positive and negative correlations between physiological responses and stress responses suggested physiological responses could have negative feedback on severity of stress responses. This finding has not been convincingly demonstrated in previous research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The transformation of the current world of work, determined by technological advances, affects and challenges the career decision-making process. To face these changes, the career self-management model, derived from social cognitive career theory, offers an optimal framework that allows studying the career adaptive behaviors that favor the preparation for career decision-making. In order to obtain a measure for the core construct, career decision-making self-efficacy, we elaborated an item bank from the selection of reagents from two scales widely used in the field for its estimation. Item analysis was performed from the item response theory. The results evidenced the unidimensionality of the item pool, with difficulty indexes and ability levels covering most of the measured continuum. As regard reliability indexes (persons and items), we observed that the allocation of persons and items might be reproduced in a predictable way. Global fit of items was suitable in most of them. We also performed two analyses of the evidence of the validity of the scores obtained through the Career Decision Making Self-Efficacy-Item Bank. We carried out a simulation study to determine the real level of ability of the subjects, providing information on the quality of the item bank developed to accurately assess career decision self-efficacy. Thus, we conducted a concurrent validity evidence study to establish test-criterion relationships between career decision self-efficacy and the more significant outcome variables of the career decision-making process: career decision, career indecision, and decisional anxiety. In summary, we developed, calibrated, and validated the first item bank to estimate the central construct of the career decision-making process, which is the first step to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test. Based on this technology, personalized evaluations of specific skills or traits such as career decision self-efficacy can be obtained and incorporated into computer-assisted career guidance systems.

AB  - The current study developed and examined the performance of a computerized adaptive version of the Social Interaction Anxiety and Social Phobia Scales (SIAS/SPS) and compared results with a previously developed static short form (SIAS-6/SPS-6) in terms of measurement precision, concordance with the full forms, and sensitivity to treatment. Among an online sample of Australian adults, there were relatively minor differences in the performance of the adaptive tests and static short forms when compared with the full scales. Moreover, both adaptive and static short forms generated similar effect sizes across treatment in a clinical sample. This provides further evidence for the use of static or adaptive short forms of the SIAS/SPS rather than the lengthier 20-item versions. However, at the individual level, the adaptive tests were able to maintain an acceptable level of precision, using few items as possible, across the severity continua in contrast to the static short forms.

AB  - Item selection procedures designed for computerized adaptive testing need to accurately estimate every taker's trait level (<ce><b8>) and, at the same time, effectively use all items in a bank. Empirical studies showed that classical item selection procedures based on maximizing Fisher or other related information yielded highly varied item exposure rates; with these procedures, some items were frequently used whereas others were rarely selected. In the literature, methods have been proposed for controlling exposure rates; they tend to affect the accuracy in <ce><b8> estimates, however. A modified version of the maximum Fisher information (MFI) criterion, coined the nearest neighbors (NN) criterion, is proposed in this study. The NN procedure improves to a moderate extent the undesirable item exposure rates associated with the MFI criterion and keeps sufficient precision in estimates. The NN criterion will be compared with a few other existing methods in an empirical study using the mean squared errors in <ce><b8> estimates and plots of item exposure rates associated with different distributions.

AB  - Primary objective: To conceptualize functional cognitive constructs across the continuum of traumatic brain injury (TBI) recovery, to form the foundation for the Computer Adaptive Measure of Functional Cognition for TBI (CAMFC-TBI). Background: TBI often has a profound impact on a survivor<e2><80><99>s ability to return to previous level of functioning and significantly reduces the overall quality of life for survivors and caregivers. Few assessments are designed to evaluate TBI<e2><80><99>s impact on cognitive functioning in everyday life. Neuropsychological tests are time consuming and may have questionable ecological validity for predicting functional outcomes. Global functional assessments contain few cognitive items and may lack psychometric rigour. Presently there is a lack of efficient, precise, ecologically valid functional cognitive measures. Main outcome and results: Studies that used neuropsychological and global functional assessments were reviewed to direct conceptualization of functional cognitive constructs across TBI recovery stages. An advisory panel reviewed study methodology and functional cognitive constructs development. They validated the need for the CAMFC-TBI and the six functional cognitive constructs: attention, memory, processing speed, executive functioning, social communication and emotional management. Conclusion: Conceptualizing functional cognitive constructs is the first step in CAMFC-TBI development. Future project stages include item pool development, qualitative testing, field-testing, psychometric analysis and computerized adaptive test programming.

AB  - Objective: The 22-item PROMIS<c2><ae>-Rx Pain Medication Misuse item bank (Bank-22) imposes a high response burden. This study aimed to characterize the performance of the Bank-22 in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) setting based on varied stopping rules. Methods: The 22 items were administered to 288 patients. We performed a CAT simulation using default stopping rules (CATPROMIS). In 5 other simulations, a 'best health' response rule was added to decrease response burden. This rule stopped CAT administration when a participant selected 'never' to a specified number of initial Bank-22 items (2<e2><80><93>6 in this study, designated CATAlt2-Alt6). The Bank-22 and 7-item short form (SF-7) scores were compared to scores based on CATPROMIS, and the 5 CAT variations. Results: Bank-22 scores correlated highly with the SF-7 and CATPROMIS, Alt5, Alt6 scores (r=0.87<e2><80><93>0.95) and moderately with CATAlt2-Alt4 scores (r=0.63<e2><80><93>0.74). In all CAT conditions, the greatest differences with Bank-22 scores were at the lower end of misuse T-scores. The smallest differences with Bank-22 and CATPROMIS scores were observed with CATAlt5 and CATAlt6. Compared to the SF-7, CATAlt5 and CATAlt6 reduced overall response burden by about 42%. Finally, the correlations between PROMIS-Rx Misuse and Anxiety T-scores remained relatively unchanged across the conditions (r=0.31<e2><80><93>0.43, Ps < .001). Conclusions: Applying a stopping rule based on number of initial 'best health' responses reduced response burden for respondents with lower levels of misuse. The tradeoff was less measurement precision for those individuals, which could be an acceptable tradeoff when the chief concern is in discriminating higher levels of misuse.

AB  - Time use studies uncover the organization of daily routine of families of children with disabilities. The objective of this study is to identify determinants of time spent caring for children/adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typical development (TD). Participants were caregivers of children/adolescents with/without disability. Structural equation modeling tested a proposed model of time spent in child care. The variables in the model were as follows: questionnaire (families<e2><80><99> socioeconomic status [SES]), children<e2><80><99>s functioning (The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory<e2><80><93>Computer Adaptive Test [PEDI-CAT]); hours of care (daily diaries), number of adaptations used, and help with child care (parents<e2><80><99> report). Distinct variable combinations explained 78% of the variation in the time to care (TD model), followed by 42% (ASD) and 29% (CP). Adaptations indirectly affected time to care through its effect on functioning (CP); family<e2><80><99>s SES affected functioning through its effect on adaptation use (ASD). In conclusion, knowledge of factors affecting caregivers<e2><80><99> time spent on children<e2><80><99>s care help occupational therapists implement family-centered strategies.

AB  - Background and aims: The focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multidimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risktaking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the itembank, (2) calibrate the itembank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptomspecific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CATSUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain. Design: Item bank construction, item calibration phase, CATSUD validation phase. Setting: Primary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patienttopatient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles). Participants/cases: Calibration phase: the CATSUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CATSUD. Measurements: A total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CATSUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis. Findings: Calibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multidimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CATSUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CATSUD (AUC = 0.85). Conclusions: We have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multidimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CATSUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

AB  - AIM: The Pennsylvania first episode psychosis program evaluation (PA-FEP-PE) core assessment battery was developed as a standard and comprehensive clinical assessment and data collection tool in Pennsylvania coordinated specialty care programs (CSC). To reduce administrative time and maximize clinical utility by maintaining acceptable levels of precision, we aimed to generate a short form using item response theory (IRT)-based computer-adaptive test (CAT) simulation and analyse the implementation and acceptability of the short form among providers from PA-CSC. METHODS: FEP participants (n = 759; age 14-36) from nine coordinated specialty care programs completed 156 items drawn from the PA-FEP-PE battery. Multidimensional IRT-based CAT simulations were used to select the best PA-FEP-PE items for abbreviated forms. RESULTS: A 67-item PA-FEP-PE short form was developed to capture six factors: (1) positive affect and surgency (with negative loadings on Anxious-Misery items); (2) psychiatric services satisfaction; (3) antipsychotic side effect severity; (4) family turmoil and associated traumas; (5) trauma load; and (6) psychosis. The total number of items was reduced more than 50% in the PA-FEP-PE shortened forms. The short form demonstrated good psychometric properties, and it was well accepted by our providers in the implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical derivation and implementation of abbreviated measures of key domains and constructs in FEP care have streamlined and facilitated PA-FEP program evaluation. Our work supports potential application of IRT based methods to empirically reduce core assessment battery measures in large-scale data collection efforts such as in the Early Psychosis Intervention Network.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the ecological validity and clinical utility of NIH Patient Reported-Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) instruments for anger, depression, and fatigue in women with premenstrual symptoms. METHODS: One-hundred women completed daily diaries and weekly PROMIS assessments over 4weeks. Weekly assessments were administered through Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). Weekly CATs and corresponding daily scores were compared to evaluate ecological validity. To test clinical utility, we examined if CATs could detect changes in symptom levels, if these changes mirrored those obtained from daily scores, and if CATs could identify clinically meaningful premenstrual symptom change. RESULTS: PROMIS CAT scores were higher in the pre-menstrual than the baseline (ps<.0001) and post-menstrual (ps<.0001) weeks. The correlations between CATs and aggregated daily scores ranged from .73 to .88 supporting ecological validity. Mean CAT scores showed systematic changes in accordance with the menstrual cycle and the magnitudes of the changes were similar to those obtained from the daily scores. Finally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses demonstrated the ability of the CATs to discriminate between women with and without clinically meaningful premenstrual symptom change. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CAT instruments for anger, depression, and fatigue demonstrated validity and utility in premenstrual symptom assessment. The results provide encouraging initial evidence of the utility of PROMIS instruments for the measurement of affective premenstrual symptoms.

AB  - An adaptive testing procedure was adopted in a routing system for sending an examinee to his or her appropriate instructional level in a series of lessons teaching signed-number operations, written on the computer-based education system PLATO. Two samples totaling 175 8th graders were tested. The procedure worked well for most Ss but not for those who were exposed to a different conceptual framework of instruction prior to the PLATO instructional lesson. Differences in prior and subsequent instructional methods affected the learning of more advanced materials and produced lower achievement scores on the posttest given at the end of the program.

AB  - A comprehensive psychological evaluation is distinguished by a process that takes in consideration the history and clinical observations in a meaningful and contextual way in order to identify the most appropriate instruments and thus carry out a comprehensive analysis of the scores, facilitating an accurate diagnostic impression. We present a case study comparing and analyzing data from two psychological evaluations carried out at the age of 7 years and 3 months and, at 9 years and 3 months, in a child with a subarachnoid cyst affecting the frontal, temporal, and right parietal lobes. As a result of the brain injury, the child exhibited changes in emotional modulation, executive functioning, and learning. As part of the comprehensive evaluation, the following assessment protocol was used: developmental history, previous psychological evaluations, results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, tests of verbal and non-verbal intelligence, achievement tests, neuropsychological and adaptive tests. The results obtained highlight positive changes in the child when comparing the two times under consideration. The comprehensive approach allowed analyzing the child's functioning in different areas and offering a differential diagnosis, considering the brain injury, and adjusting the therapeutic and academic recommendations.

AB  - Comparing to the nonadaptive testing, the major advantage of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is that the examinees achieve the same degree of measurement precision (i.e., fixed precision). But few studies are devoted to the termination rules in variable-length cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT). Inspired by the termination rule research in traditional CAT, this paper proposed four termination rules for variable-length CD-CAT. The new termination rules were standard error of attribute method (SEA), difference of the adjacent posterior probability method (DAPP), halving algorithm (HA) and hybrid method (HM), respectively. Then, the four new termination rules were compared with the HSU and KL method under two scenarios: with and without item exposure control. Three exposure control methods were considered, i.e., simple, modified restrictive progressive (MRP) and modified restrictive threshold (MRT) method. The MRP and MRT methods were extension of the Wang et al.'s (2011) work to the variable-length CD-CAT scenario. The results indicated that: (1) When the criterion of variable-length termination rule was conservative, the mean of the test length and the percentage of examinees reaching the maximum test length were large, and the classification accuracy rate for examinees who finished the CAT using fixed precision was high. (2) Without the item exposure control, the four new variable-length termination rules had a similar performance compared to the HSU method. With the increase of maximum posterior probability and the decrease of <c2><a3>, the classification accuracy rate and the mean test length presented a increasing trend. But the item pool usage was unsatisfactory. (3) With the item exposure control, item pool usage was greatly improved in the six variable-length termination rules while the classification accuracy rates were maintained. Different exposure control methods had a different effect on the different variable-length termination rules. The relative criterion termination rules such as DAPP and KL methods were easily affected by the item exposure control. (4) Taken all together, the SEA, HM, and HA methods were comparable to the HSU method, and followed by the KL and DAPP method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: To be patient-centered, assessment must extract what patients prefer to be able to do along with what they can do now so health care can specifically address the gap between current and preferred abilities. In this project, we compared patient-perceived current<e2><80><93>preferred gaps with the assessments and interventions reported by clinicians in a rehabilitation clinic. Methods: Sixty-two patients in outpatient physical therapy completed a computer-adaptive test version of the patient-reported Movement Ability Measure (MAM-CAT) at initial visit and discharge. The MAM-CAT calculated the gaps between the movement patients perceived that they could do 'Now' and what movement ability they 'Would Like' to have across six dimensions of movement: flexibility, strength, accuracy, speed, adaptability, and endurance. Physical therapists<e2><80><99> notes regarding assessments and interventions were categorized based on these same six dimensions of movement. Frequency of agreement between the largest patient-perceived gaps and clinician-documented emphases was recorded (kappa analyses), along with MAM-CAT changes at discharge (paired t tests).Results: Although patient progress was noted in both the MAM-CAT and the clinician notes (p < .05), comparison showed poor or slight agreement (kappa < .05) between the specific movement dimensions patients regarded as having the largest gaps and the dimensions on which clinicians focused.Conclusion: The MAM-CAT facilitated direct comparison of patients<e2><80><99> current<e2><80><93>preferred gaps at initiation and discharge with clinicians<e2><80><99> emphases during episodes of care. While interventions were perceived as effective, collaboration between patients and clinicians using gap data could increase alignment between patient priorities and clinician emphases, potentially resulting in improved patient engagement and rehabilitative outcomes.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is a critical gap in the literature regarding the efficacy of occupational therapy interventions for pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that occupational therapy 4-5x/wk during inpatient hospitalization positively affects strength, coordination, and independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) of pediatric patients during HCT. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient bone marrow transplant unit at a children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two pediatric patients admitted for HCT. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were seen by an occupational therapist as part of an interdisciplinary program. Interventions included play and leisure engagement, upper extremity therapeutic exercises, fine motor activities, and ADL training. Strength, coordination, and daily living skills data were documented prospectively and analyzed retrospectively to compare differences between patients seen by occupational therapy at high versus low frequency. RESULTS: For grip strength (dynamometer), fine motor dexterity (the 9-Hole Peg Test), and independence in ADLs (an ADL functional measure and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test Daily Activities), the high-frequency group had a significantly smaller decrease in performance from time of admission at pretransplant (baseline) to peak decline after transplant. Grip strength and ADL scores for the high-frequency group returned to baseline at time of discharge more readily than for the low-frequency group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Participation in occupational therapy 4-5x/wk had positive effects on strength, coordination, and independence in ADLs for patients undergoing HCT. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: This article provides evidence that occupational therapists are an important part of the interdisciplinary team treating pediatric bone marrow transplant patients. It also demonstrates that occupational therapy interventions delivered at a high frequency can have a positive impact on upper extremity strength and independence in ADLs.

AB  - The first 60 or so years of psychological, educational, and personnel testing were dominated by the paper-and-pencil (P&P) test. Item banking, test assembly, and test scoring were entirely manual procedures that were labor intensive, tedious, and prone to errors. Tests were highly standardized, as were conditions of administration. Changes began to occur with the introduction of electronic optical mark readers that reduced test scoring to a relatively accurate partially automated procedure that dominated standardized testing for many decades. The introduction of the PC in the mid-1980s, however, began a major evolution of testing away from the traditional way of building tests and delivering them. The years since 1985 have seen computers automate the processes of item banking, test assembly, test analysis, and test delivery. The PC allowed the development of new modes of test delivery<e2><80><94>random, sequential, and adaptive<e2><80><94>and new kinds of test items. The advent of the Internet extended test delivery to any computer that could connect to it, albeit not without some problems. The result of this evolution of testing is a set of processes that are considerably less labor intensive, more accurate, and more efficient. In the process of this ongoing conversion, numerous questions have arisen, some of which have not yet been satisfactorily studied or even addressed. Few research questions surround computerized item banking and test assembly. The major questions have risen in the context of computer-based testing (CBT). In the early days of CBT, it was natural to address the question of whether CBTs functioned the same as P&P tests. Generally, it was found that they did (Mead & Drasgow, 1993), although early research indicated some differences on reading comprehension tests (e.g., Kiely, Zara, & Weiss, 1986; Mazzeo & Harvey, 1988). As CBTs begin to be used to measure constructs that cannot be measured by P&P, however, comparability is no longer an issue, and CBTs will have to be validated on their own merits. Obviously, a host of questions exist about how to best implement computerized adaptive tests (CATs) and sequential tests that have resulted in substantial research over the past 20 or 30 years and will continue to do so. CBTs also raise a number of questions about the psychological environment of testing that have generally not been addressed. In the process of creating a test of appropriate difficulty for each examinee, CATs create a different psychological environment than do P&P tests. Does that difference affect examinee performance? PC-delivered tests have virtually no delays between items in comparison to Internet-delivered tests. Do the unpredictable delays in Internet-based testing affect examinees<e2><80><99> test anxiety and thereby influence test performance? Do the random variations in the testing environment that occur for unsupervised Internet-based testing affect test scores? Finally, as the Internet continues to pervade people<e2><80><99>s activities through various electronic devices, some have suggested that certain kinds of psychological measurements (e.g., attitudes, personality variables) can be delivered by portable electronic devices such as PDAs and cellular phones. If these modes of test delivery are implemented, the usefulness of the resulting measurements will have to be carefully scrutinized because of the extremely variable testing conditions under which such measurements will be obtained.

AB  - Objective: Caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often feel pressure to maintain the appearance that they are emotionally well adjusted, despite feelings to the contrary. Because there are currently no measures examining this construct, this article focuses on the development of a new measure that is specific to caregivers of people with TBI. Design: A total of 533 caregivers of civilians with TBI (n = 218) or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n = 315) completed 43 emotional suppression items, as well as other patient-reported outcomes and an estimate of the functional ability of the person with TBI. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the retention of 25 items. Graded response model (GRM) analyses and differential item functioning (DIF) studies supported the retention of 21 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM calibration data were used to develop a 6-item static short form (SF) and program a computer adaptive test (CAT). Internal consistency was excellent for both the CAT and SF (reliabilities <e2><89><a5> 0.91); 3-week test<e2><80><93>retest stability was good (all intraclass correlations <e2><89><a5> 0.89). Convergent validity was supported by moderate associations between TBI-CareQOL Emotional Suppression and related measures (rs from 0.47 to 0.59); discriminant validity was supported by small correlations between Emotional Suppression and positive aspects of caregiving and physical health (rs from 0.14 to 0.28). Known-groups validity was also supported. Conclusions: The new TBI-CareQOL Emotional Suppression CAT and 6-item short form is the first self-report measure of this construct in this population. Our findings suggest this new measure has strong psychometric properties. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have social and communication deficits that impair their involvement in family life. No measures of child involvement in the family have been validated for the ASD population. Aim: To evaluate the validity of a measure of Family Involvement (FI) of children ages 5<e2><80><93>12 with ASD. Method: Parents of children ages 5<e2><80><93>12 with ASD (n = 114) completed FI items from the PROMIS<c2><ae> pediatric Family Relationships item bank in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format, as well as measures of ASD symptom burden, parenting stress, and parental depression. Medical record review provided child intelligence or developmental quotient. A reference sample (n = 236) closely matching the ASD sample in age and gender was created from the national standardization sample, and underwent a simulated CAT. Results: The CAT precisely and efficiently measured parent-reported FI of children with ASD. Average FI scores were lower among children with ASD (M = 46.3, SD = 7.1) than children in the reference sample (M = 52.5, SD = 9.1). A 'dose response' decrease in FI was observed as ASD severity increased. Increased parenting stress was associated with lower FI. No relationship between FI and child IQ was found. Conclusion: The FI items captured FI among children ages 5<e2><80><93>12 with ASD with acceptable precision. Reduced FI among children with ASD, particularly those with higher symptom severity, suggests validity of the items in this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Self-report questionnaires are widely used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Ideally, such questionnaires should be adapted to the individual patient and at the same time scores should be directly comparable across patients. This may be achieved using computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Usually, CAT is carried out for a single domain at a time. However, many HRQOL domains are highly correlated. Multidimensional CAT may utilize these correlations to improve measurement efficiency. We investigated the possible advantages and difficulties of multidimensional CAT. Study Design and Setting: We evaluated multidimensional CAT of three scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30: the physical functioning, emotional functioning, and fatigue scales. Analyses utilised a database with 2958 European cancer patients. Results: It was possible to obtain scores for the three domains with five to seven items administered using multidimensional CAT that were very close to the scores obtained using all 12 items and with no or little loss of measurement precision. Conclusion: The findings suggest that multidimensional CAT may significantly improve measurement precision and efficiency and encourage further research into multidimensional CAT. Particularly, the estimation of the model underlying the multidimensional CAT and the conceptual aspects need further investigations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article presents a literature review of office-based screening of common psychiatric conditions. Depression and anxiety disorders remain significant conditions in the primary care setting and in the general population. Screening tools for depression and anxiety disorders are freely available with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Novel screening methods, including Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, are in development and may be promising tools in the future. Despite the availability of these tools and a need to improve the mental health of patients, the utility of widespread use of screening for depression and anxiety disorders in the primary care, office-based setting is uncertain, and guidelines have reached different conclusions. The best evidence for cost effectiveness currently is for screening of major depression as part of the collaborative care model for treatment. Targeted screening is another reasonable approach in patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions or certain medical conditions. Despite unanswered questions, with further research, a growing literature, and increased awareness of mental health, there is every reason for optimism for the future of mental health screening.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the convergent validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression measures relative to legacy measures and criterion validity against a structured diagnostic interview for depression in an oncology sample. Methods: 132 oncology/haematology outpatients completed the PROMIS Depression Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-D-CAT) and PROMIS Depression Short Form (PROMIS-D-SF) along with seven legacy measures: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D); Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire; Distress Thermometer and PSYCH-6. Correlations, area under the curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with Structured Clinical Interview as the gold standard. Results: Both PROMIS measures correlated with all legacy measures at p < .001 ( = 0.5890.810) and all AUCs (> 0.800) were comparable. At the cut-off points for mild depression of 53, the PROMIS measures had sensitivity (0.83 for PROMIS-D-CAT and 0.80 for PROMIS-D-SF) similar to or better than 6/7 legacy measures with high negative predictive value (> 90%). At cut-off points of 60 for moderate depression, PROMIS measures had specificity > 90%, similar to or better than all legacy measures and positive predictive value  0.50 (similar to 5/7 legacy measures). Conclusions: The convergent and criterion validity of the PROMIS depression measures in cancer populations was confirmed, although the optimal cut-off points are not established. PROMIS measures were briefer than BDI-II and CES-D but do not offer any advance in terms of diagnostic accuracy, reduced response burden or cost over other legacy measures of depression in oncology patients.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Psychometric properties for the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding: Dichotomous versus polytomous conventional and IRT scoring' by Walter P. Vispoel and Han Yi Kim (Psychological Assessment, Advanced Online Publication, Apr 7, 2014, np). The mean, standard deviation and alpha coefficient originally reported in Table 1 should be 74.317, 10.214 and .802, respectively. The validity coefficients in the last column of Table 4 are affected as well. Correcting this error did not change the substantive interpretations of the results, but did increase the mean, standard deviation, alpha coefficient, and validity coefficients reported for the Honesty subscale in the text and in Tables 1 and 4. The corrected versions of Tables 1 and Table 4 are shown in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-12154-001[/rid].) Item response theory (IRT) models were applied to dichotomous and polytomous scoring of the Self-Deceptive Enhancement and Impression Management subscales of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (Paulhus, 1991, 1999). Two dichotomous scoring methods reflecting exaggerated endorsement and exaggerated denial of socially desirable behaviors were examined. The 1- and 2-parameter logistic models (1PLM, 2PLM, respectively) were applied to dichotomous responses, and the partial credit model (PCM) and graded response model (GRM) were applied to polytomous responses. For both subscales, the 2PLM fit dichotomous responses better than did the 1PLM, and the GRM fit polytomous responses better than did the PCM. Polytomous GRM and raw scores for both subscales yielded higher test<e2><80><93>retest and convergent validity coefficients than did PCM, 1PLM, 2PLM, and dichotomous raw scores. Information plots showed that the GRM provided consistently high measurement precision that was superior to that of all other IRT models over the full range of both construct continuums. Dichotomous scores reflecting exaggerated endorsement of socially desirable behaviors provided noticeably weak precision at low levels of the construct continuums, calling into question the use of such scores for detecting instances of 'faking bad.' Dichotomous models reflecting exaggerated denial of the same behaviors yielded much better precision at low levels of the constructs, but it was still less precision than that of the GRM. These results support polytomous over dichotomous scoring in general, alternative dichotomous scoring for detecting faking bad, and extension of GRM scoring to situations in which IRT offers additional practical advantages over classical test theory (adaptive testing, equating, linking, scaling, detecting differential item functioning, and so forth).

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of the present study are to investigate the precision of static (fixed-length) short forms versus computerized adaptive testing (CAT) administration, response pattern scoring versus summed score conversion, and test<e2><80><93>retest reliability (stability) of the Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) pediatric self-report scales measuring the latent constructs of depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, pain interference, peer relationships, fatigue, mobility, upper extremity functioning, and asthma impact with polytomous items. Methods: Participants (N = 331) between the ages of 8 and 17 were recruited from outpatient general pediatrics and subspecialty clinics. Of the 331 participants, 137 were diagnosed with asthma. Three scores based on item response theory (IRT) were computed for each respondent: CAT response pattern expected a posteriori estimates, short-form response pattern expected a posteriori estimates, and short-form summed score expected a posteriori estimates. Scores were also compared between participants with and without asthma. To examine test<e2><80><93>retest reliability, 54 children were selected for retesting approximately 2 weeks after the first assessment. Results: A short CAT (maximum 12 items with a standard error of 0.4) was found, on average, to be less precise than the static short forms. The CAT appears to have limited usefulness over and above what can be accomplished with the existing static short forms (8<e2><80><93>10 items). Stability of the scale scores over a 2-week period was generally supported. Conclusion: The study provides further information on the psychometric properties of the PROMIS pediatric scales and extends the previous IRT analyses to include precision estimates of dynamic versus static administration, test<e2><80><93> retest reliability, and validity of administration across groups. Both the positive and negative aspects of using CAT versus short forms are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In spite of the diversity of practices in personnel recruiting and selection (PRS), a tendency to use current technologies is becoming more and more a practice both for automation of psychological assessment actions and for off-site and on-request assessment (24<c3><97>7). New tests embodying enriched items or virtual reality simulations together with classical methods such as adaptive tests, change practice scenarios and pose academic challenges. Videoconference interviews are of particular interest because of the ubiquity of interviews in personnel recruitment and selection. All these changes in techniques and methods need research and reflection. This paper presents a synopsis of current knowledge coming both from literature and from professional practice. It is a radical situation that affects by and large both strategies and relations with candidates. The kernel is to achieve the effectiveness of PRS processes within established ethical and deontological limits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The majority of persons with Huntington disease (HD) experience mental health symptoms. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are capable of capturing unobservable behaviors and feelings relating to mental health. The current study aimed to test the reliability and responsiveness to self-reported and clinician-rated change over time of Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs over the course of a 24-month period. Methods: At baseline, 12-months, and 24-months, 362 participants with premanifest or manifest HD completed the Neuro-QoL Depression computer adaptive test (CAT), PROMIS Depression short form (SF), Neuro-QoL Anxiety CAT, PROMIS Anxiety SF, PROMIS Anger CAT and SF, Neuro-QoL Emotional/Behavioral Dyscontrol CAT and SF, Neuro-QoL Positive Affect and Well-Being CAT and SF, and Neuro-QoL Stigma CAT and SF. Participants completed several clinician-administered measures at each time point, as well as several global ratings of change at 12- and 24-months. Reliability (test-retest reliability and measurement error) and responsiveness (using standardized response means and general linear models) were assessed. Results: Test-retest reliability and measurement error were excellent for all PROs (all ICC <e2><89><a5> .90 for test-retest reliability and all SEM percentages <e2><89><a4> 6.82%). In addition, 12- and 24-month responsiveness were generally supported for the Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs; findings relative to clinician-rated anchors of change (e.g., SRMs for the group with declines ranged from .38 to .91 for 24-month change and .09 to .45, with the majority above .25 for 12-month change) were generally more robust than those relative to self-reported anchors of change (e.g., SRMs for the group with declines ranged from .02 to .75, with the majority above .39 for 24-month change and .09 to .45, with the majority above .16 for 12-month change). Conclusions: The Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs demonstrated strong psychometric reliability, as well as responsiveness to self-reported and clinician-rated change over time in people with HD.

AB  - Inspired by the Raven<e2><80><99>s Progressive Matrices a new, innovative, IRT-based online adaptive test, the Scrambled Adaptive Matrices (SAM) has been developed and used in talent identification projects both in educational and work settings with more than 15 000 participants. The current article introduces the test and shows results on reliability and validity as well as response time, motivational concerns, adaptivity, security and the effects of external variables such as socio-economic status, age, gender and pre-selection. The data show that the newly developed instrument is a feasible, reliable and valid tool for ability assessment and talent identification in projects of all sizes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate advanced psychometric properties of the 15-item Economic Strain and Resilience in Cancer (ENRICh) measure of financial toxicity for cancer patients. METHODS: We surveyed 515 cancer patients in the greater Houston metropolitan area using ENRICh from March 2019 to March 2020. We conducted a series of factor analyses alongside parametric and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) assessments using Mokken analysis and the graded response model (GRM). We utilized parameters derived from the GRM to run a simulated computerized adaptive test (CAT) assessment. RESULTS: Among participants, mean age was 58.49 years and 278 (54%) were female. The initial round factor analysis results suggested a one-factor scale structure. Negligible levels of differential item functioning (DIF) were evident between eight items. Three items were removed due to local interdependence (Q3>+0.4). The original 11-point numerical rating scale did not function well, and a new 3-point scoring system was implemented. The final 12-item ENRICh had acceptable fit to the GRM (p<0.001; TLI = 0.94; CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.09; RMSR = 0.06) as well as good scalability and dimensionality. We observed high correlation between CAT version scores and the 12-item measure (r = 0.98). During CAT, items 2 (money you owe) and 4 (stress level about finances) were most frequently administered, followed by items 1 (money in savings) and 5 (ability to pay bills). Scores from these four items alone were strongly correlated with that of the 12-item ENRICh (r = 0.96). CONCLUSION: These CAT and 4-item versions provide options for quick screening in clinical practice and low-burden assessment in research.

AB  - We examined cultural differences in the item characteristic functions of self-reported of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mania<e2><88><92>hypomania in a Latino population taking Computerized Adaptive Tests for Mental Health (CAT-MH) in Spanish versus a non-Latino sample taking the tests in English. We studied differential item functioning (DIF) of the most common adaptively administered symptom items out of a bank of 1,008 items between Latino (n = 1276) and non-Latino (n = 798) subjects. For depression, we identified 4 items with DIF that were good discriminators for non-Latinos but poor discriminators for Latinos. These items were related to cheerfulness, life satisfaction, concentration, and fatigue. The correlation between the original calibration and a Latino-only new calibration after eliminating these items was r = .990. For anxiety, no items with DIF were identified. The correlation between the original and new calibrations was r = .993. For mania<e2><88><92>hypomania, we identified 4 items with differential item functioning that were good discriminators for non-Latinos but poor discriminators for Latinos. These items were related to risk-taking, self-assurance, and sexual activity. The correlation between the original and new calibration was r = .962. Once the identified items were removed, the correlation between the original calibration and a Latino-only calibration was r = .96 or greater. These findings reveal that the CAT-MH can be reliably used to measure depression, anxiety, and mania in Latinos taking these tests in Spanish. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement<e2><80><94>This is the first study to validate the use of computerized adaptive tests for depression, anxiety, and mania at the symptom level in Latinos taking computerized adaptive tests in Spanish. We determined which symptoms that were good discriminators of high and low severity in a non-Latino population taking the tests in English were poor discriminators in a Spanish-speaking Latino population. The findings provide relatively unbiased cross-cultural psychiatric comparisons. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Most computerized adaptive testing (CAT) do not allow examinees to review items because it will drastically decrease measurement precision and bring about extra cheating strategies (Wainer, 1993; Wise, 1996). Allowing item review is essential to make CAT comparable with traditional tests. It also matters in application. Item review enables examinees to correct mistakes due to carelessness, which can further improve the precision of ability estimation. No such option may cause some negative consequences for their overall performance especially in high-stake examinations, such as tension or anxiety (Vispoel, Henderickson, & Bleiler, 2000). Therefore, it is worth trying if allowing item review could alleviate problems mentioned at the beginning (Wise, 1996; Vispoel, 2000, 2005). Several methods have been proposed, including the successive block method (Stocking, 1997) and the item pocket (IP) method (Han, 2013). However, both methods are limited in some ways. Stocking's method does not allow examinees to skip items and requires a large number of blocks which may bring about some extra adverse effects because of frequent decision to go to next block. Han's method can avoid limitations of Stocking's. But it requires an appropriate IP size and may result in high bias in large IP size situation. The present study proposed the block item pocket (BIP) method which sets fewer but larger blocks with a proper total IP size. This method keeps advantages of Stocking's and Han's and overcomes their disadvantages. Two simulation studies of two response strategies were conducted to evaluate validity of the BIP method. Item parameters were randomly drawn from uniform distribution (b ~ U (-3, 3)) and (a ~ U (0, 2)). Each examinee was administered a fixed-length CAT with 30 items. The initial item for each examinee was randomly drawn from 0 ~ U (-0.5, 0.5). For the CAT administration, the Maximum Fisher Information method was adopted to select items. The interim and final scores were estimated using MLE method in most conditions. When responses were less than 5 or when all answers were correct or wrong, EAP method was adopted. Each study contained five conditions: non-review, 1 blocks IP method, 2 blocks, 3 blocks and 6 blocks BIP method. Statistics like BIAS, MAEj and RMSE were used as evaluation criteria. Results indicated that: (1) BIP method had better estimate precision than IP method at low ability level under normal strategy; (2) When dealing with Wainer-like strategy, BIP method was far more precise than item pocket method at all ability levels; (3) As the number of blocks increased, estimate precision got closer to non-review condition. Advantages of this new method and future directions were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A series of static and adaptive screeners for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were developed and compared using datadriven methods to facilitate the measurement of each disorder in community samples. Data comprised 3175 respondents for the development sample and 3755 respondents for the validation sample, recruited independently using Facebook advertising. Item Response Theory (IRT) was utilized to develop static continuous screeners and to simulate computerized adaptive algorithms. The screeners consisted of a small subset of items from each bank (79% reduction in items for panic disorder, 85% reduction in items for SAD, and 84% reduction in items for OCD) that provided similar scores (r = 0.880.96). Both static and adaptive screeners were valid with respect to existing scales that purportedly measure similar constructs (r > 0.70 for panic disorder, r > 0.76 for SAD, and r > 0.68 for OCD). The adaptive scales were able to maintain a higher level of precision in comparison to the static scales and evidenced slightly higher concordance with scores generated by the full item banks. The screeners for panic disorder, SAD, and OCD could be used as a flexible approach to measure and monitor the severity of psychopathology in tailored treatment protocols.

AB  - We assessed differential item functioning (DIF) based on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to examine how perinatal mood disorders differ from adult psychiatric disorders. The CAT-Mental Health (CAT-MH) was administered to 1614 adult psychiatric outpatients and 419 perinatal women with IRB approval. We examined individual item-level differences using logistic regression and overall score differences by scoring the perinatal data using the original bifactor model calibration based on the psychiatric sample data and a new bifactor model calibration based on the perinatal data and computing their correlation. To examine convergent validity, we computed correlations of the CAT-MH with contemporaneously administered Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS). The rate of major depression in the perinatal sample was 13 %. Rates of anxiety, mania, and suicide risk were 5, 6, and 0.4 %, respectively. One of 66 depression items, one of 69 anxiety items, and 15 of 53 mania items exhibited DIF (i.e., failure to discriminate between high and low levels of the disorder) in the perinatal sample based on the psychiatric sample calibration. Removal of these items resulted in correlations of the original and perinatal calibrations of r = 0.983 for depression, r = 0.986 for anxiety, and r = 0.932 for mania. The 91.3 % of cases were concordantly categorized as either 'at-risk' or 'low-risk' between the EPDS and the perinatal calibration of the CAT-MH. There was little evidence of DIF for depression and anxiety symptoms in perinatal women. This was not true for mania. Now calibrated for perinatal women, the CAT-MH can be evaluated for longitudinal symptom monitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study assessed the association of anger, anxiety, and depression, and cognitive bias with pain and activity tolerance among patients with a musculoskeletal illness or injury expected to last more than a month. 102 Patients completed emotional thermometers to quantify symptoms of anger, anxiety, depression; the abbreviated Pain Catastrophizing Scale; a pain intensity scale; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test; the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and demographic questionnaires. Controlling for potential confounding in multivariable analysis we found greater activity intolerance was associated with retired work-status and greater depressive symptoms, but not with greater symptoms of anger. In addition, greater pain intensity was associated with greater symptoms of depression and greater catastrophic thinking, but not with greater symptoms of anger. Anger emotions do not contribute to symptom intensity and activity intolerance in musculoskeletal illness. Attention can be directed at addressing psychological distress and cognitive bias.

The present study looked at the importance of item feedback in self-adapted testing. Computerized adaptive tests and self-adapted tests were compared under both feedback and no-feedback conditions, using 363 college students. Self-adapted tests yielded higher test performance and lower anxiety than the computerized adaptive tests regardless of the feedback condition. These findings indicate that item feedback is not necessary for the score differences between self-adapted testing and computerized adaptive testing to be realized.

AB  - To better understand not only the minds, but also the hearts of key publics, we have developed a more systemic approach to understand the responses of audiences in crisis situations. The Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) model is based on a publics-based, emotion-driven perspective where the publics' responses to different crises are mapped on 2 continua, the organization's engagement in the crisis and primary publics' coping strategy. This multistage testing found evidence that anxiety was the default emotion that publics felt in crises. The subsequent emotions felt by the publics varied in different quadrants involving different crisis types. As far as coping strategies were concerned, conative coping was more evident than cognitive coping across the 4 quadrants. Evidence also suggested strong merit that conative coping was the external manifestation of the internal cognitive processing that had taken place. Cognitive coping was thus the antecedent of conative coping. Although both the publics and the organizations agreed that the crises were relevant to the organizations' goals, they differed on who should assume more responsibility. The findings, although still very much exploratory, suggest theoretical rigor in the model, with room for further refinements to generate what Yin (2003) termed 'analytic generalization' (p. 33) for the ICM model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) provides an alternative to fixed-length assessments. The study validated a suite of computerized adaptive tests for mental health (CAT-MH) in a community psychiatric sample. METHODS: A total of 145 adults from a community outpatient clinic, including 19 with no history of a mental disorder (control group), were prospectively evaluated with CAT for depression (CAD-MDD and CAT-DI), mania (CAT-MANIA), and anxiety symptoms (CAT-ANX). Ratings were compared with gold-standard psychiatric assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-25), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for CAD-MDD were .96 and .64, respectively (.96 and 1.00 for major depression versus the control group). CAT for depression severity (CAT-DI) correlated well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.79), PHQ-9 (r=.90), and CES-D (r=.90) and had an odds ratio (OR) of 27.88 across its range for current SCID major depressive disorder. CAT-ANX correlated with the HAM-D-25 (r=.73), PHQ-9 (r=.78), and CES-D (r=.81) and had an OR of 11.52 across its range for current SCID generalized anxiety disorder. CAT-MANIA did not correlate well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.31), PHQ-9 (r=.37), and CES-D (r=.39), but it had an OR of 11.56 across its range for a current SCID bipolar diagnosis. Participants found the CAT-MH acceptable and easy to use, averaging 51.7 items and 9.4 minutes to complete the full battery. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gold-standard diagnostic and assessment measures, CAT-MH provided an effective, rapidly administered assessment of psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - Examined timing behavior in computerized adaptive testing. To examine whether correct answers require more processing time than incorrect answers, 120 male students (median age 25 yrs) living in Germany were confronted with perceptual and cognitive discrimination tasks. The results confirmed that response times for incorrect answers were significantly longer than those for correct answers. The findings support the assumption that timing behavior represents an independent personality trait. The tests used were the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and the Eysenck Personality Inventory Questionnaire. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Es wird informiert <c3><bc>ber die Entwicklung des computer-adaptiven Tests zur Erfassung von Stresserleben (Stress-CAT). Daten wurden an einer Stichprobe von 1092 Patientinnen und Patienten erhoben, die an einer Medizinischen Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Psychosomatik im Rahmen der Routinediagnostik eine umfangreiche Batterie etablierter konventioneller Frageb<c3><b6>gen computergest<c3><bc>tzt beantwortet hatten. Die Eigenschaften dieser Items wurden anhand ihrer residualen Korrelationen nach konfirmatorischer Faktorenanalyse, ihrer Antwortkategorienfunktion und ihrer Diskriminationsf<c3><a4>higkeit <c3><bc>berpr<c3><bc>ft. Von insgesamt 126 Items verblieben 38 Items in der finalen Itembank in der Dimension &quot;erlebte Belastung&quot; und 31 Items in der Dimension &quot;Belastungsreaktion&quot;, die f<c3><bc>r die Anwendung eines Zwei-Parameter-Modells (Generalized-Partial-Credit-Model) als geeignet angesehen wurden. In Simulationsexperimenten zeigte sich, dass der Stress-CAT mit durchschnittlich 10 plus-minus 1,7$ Items aus der Itembank im Bereich von plus-minus 2 Standardabweichungen um den Populationsmittelwert f<c3><bc>r die Dimension &quot;erlebte Belastung&quot; und mit durchschnittlich 8 plus-minus 2,2$ Items f<c3><bc>r die Dimension &quot;Belastungsreaktion&quot; CAT-Scores mit einem Standardmessfehler von .32 (Reliabilit<c3><a4>t .90) sch<c3><a4>tzen kann. Zudem zeigten die Simulationsstudien, dass der CAT-Algorithmus in den oberen und unteren Merkmalsauspr<c3><a4>gungen des Stresserlebens besser zu differenzieren vermag und somit den hier eingesetzten Fragebogenerhebungen, die auf der Klassischen Testtheorie basieren, in Pr<c3><a4>zision und <c3><96>konomie <c3><bc>berlegen ist.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computer adaptive tests (CATs) offer a flexible, test fair, and economic opportunity for accurate measurement of anxiety in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The objective of this study was to develop and calibrate an item bank [anxiety item bank for cardiovascular patients (AIB-cardio)] as a prerequisite for an anxiety-CAT in CVD patients. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: After pretesting for relevance and comprehension, a pool of 155 anxiety items was answered on a five-point Likert scale. Sample consisted of 715 CVD patients, who were recruited in 14 German cardiac rehabilitation centers. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Mokken analysis, and Rasch analysis were conducted. RESULTS: The results of CFA and Mokken analysis confirmed one factor structure and double monotonicity. In Rasch analysis, merging response categories and removing items with misfit, differential item functioning or local response dependency reduced the AIB-cardio to 37 items. The AIB-cardio fitted to the Rasch model with a nonsignificant item-trait interaction (chi-square, 133.89; degrees of freedom, 111; P = 0.07). Person separation reliability was 0.85, and unidimensionality could be verified. CONCLUSION: The calibrated, unidimensional AIB-cardio provides the basis for a CAT to assess anxiety in rehabilitation patients with CVD with good psychometric properties. Further testing in other cardiovascular patients is needed to increase generalizability.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative patient-reported outcomes as predictors of functional improvement following ligament reconstruction tendon interposition. We hypothesized that high levels of preoperative pain interference (PI) and upper-extremity disability are associated with lower magnitudes of functional improvement >/=1 year after surgery on the shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) (primary outcome) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Upper Extremity (UE) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) (UE CAT) v1.2 (secondary outcome). METHODS: Adult patients who underwent ligament reconstruction tendon interposition between February 2014 and April 2018 at an academic tertiary institution were considered for inclusion in this longitudinal cohort study. Patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and >/=1 year after surgery. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the magnitude of functional improvement on the QuickDASH and UE CAT. RESULTS: Among 93 included participants, the mean age was 61 +/- 7 years, and 75 (81%) were women. At 2.5 +/- 1.0 years after surgery, the QuickDASH and UE CAT improved by a mean of 24.5 +/- 20.9 and 9.9 +/- 10.7 points, respectively. In the primary multivariable model, a greater preoperative QuickDASH (indicative of lower function; coefficient, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 0.9) and lower preoperative Performance of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PI CAT (eg, less pain interference; coefficient, -0.7; 95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2) were associated with greater QuickDASH improvement independent of potential confounders. In the secondary multivariable model, lower preoperative UE CAT (indicative of worse function; coefficient, -0.9; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.7) and lower preoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PI CAT (coefficient, -0.3; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1) were associated with greater UE CAT improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative patient-reported outcomes may be useful in understanding the degree of improvement that certain patient populations can expect from ligament reconstruction tendon interposition. Those with lower baseline (preoperative) upper-extremity function and PI are expected to derive the greatest functional improvement in the midterm. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.

AB  - The replacement of existing technology or the introduction of novel technology into the day-to-day routines of higher education institutions is not a trivial task. Currently, many higher education institutions are faced with the challenge of replacing existing procedures for administering written exams with e-exams. To guide this process, this paper proposes the novel technology-based exams acceptance model (TEAM) and empirically evaluates its model structure and usefulness from the perspective of higher education teachers. The model can be used to guide the transition from paper-based exams to e-exams and the implementation of innovative (e.g., adaptive) e-exam formats. The model includes perceived usefulness, computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, prior experience, facilitating conditions, and subjective norm as predictors of the behavioral intention to use e-exams. To test the model empirically, the responses of 992 teachers at 63 German universities to a standardized online questionnaire were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The model fit was acceptable. With 77% (conventional e-exams) and 82% (adaptive e-exams), a large proportion of the variance of the intention to use these types of exams was explained. With TEAM, a highly predictive model for explaining the behavioral intention to use e-exams is now available. It offers a theoretical basis that can be used for the successful implementation of e-exams in higher education.

AB  - A tablet-based language-independent self-test involving the recognition of ecological sounds in background noise, the Sound Ear Check (SEC), was adapted to make it feasible for young children. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment investigated the SEC's feasibility, as well as its sensitivity and specificity for detecting childhood hearing loss with a monaural adaptive test procedure. In the second experiment, the SEC sounds, noise, and test format were adapted based on the findings of the first experiment. The adaptations were combined with three test procedures, one similar to the one used in Experiment 1, one presenting the sounds dichotically in diotic noise, and one presenting all the sounds with a fixed signal-to-noise ratio and a stopping rule. Results in young children show high sensitivity and specificity to detect different grades of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (70-90%). When using an adaptive, monaural procedure, the test duration was approximately 6 min, and 17% of the results obtained were unreliable. Adaptive staircase analyses showed that the unreliable results probably occur due to attention/motivation loss. The test duration could be reduced to 3-4 min with adapted test formats without decreasing the test-retest reliability. The unreliable test results could be reduced from 17% to as low as 5%. However, dichotic presentation requires longer training, reducing the dichotic test format's feasibility.

AB  - Our understanding of longitudinal outcomes of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) survivors is limited by the heterogeneity of follow-up intervals, populations, and outcomes assessed. We sought to demonstrate (1) the feasibility of longitudinal multidimensional outcome assessment and (2) methods to promote cohort retention. The objective of this presented study was to provide details of follow-up methodology in a PICU survivor cohort and not to present the outcomes at long-term follow-up for this cohort. We enrolled 152 children aged 0 to 17 years admitted to the PICU in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. We examined resource utilization, family impact of critical illness, and neurodevelopment using the PICU Outcomes Portfolio (POP) Survey which included a study-specific survey and validated tools: 1. Functional Status Scale, 2. Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, 3. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 4. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and 5. Vanderbilt Assessment Scales for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder. POP Survey completion rates were 89%, 78%, and 84% at 1, 3, and 6 months. Follow-up rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 80%, 55%, and 43%. Implementing a longitudinal multidimensional outcome portfolio for PICU survivors is feasible within an urban, tertiary-care, academic hospital. Our attrition after one year demonstrates the long-term follow-up challenges in this population. Our findings inform ongoing efforts to implement core outcome sets after pediatric critical illness.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The integration of a web-based computer-adaptive patient-reported outcome test (CAT) platform with persuasive design optimised features including recommendations for action into routine healthcare could provide a promising way to translate reliable diagnostic results into action. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such a platform for depression and anxiety (RehaCAT+) compared with the standard diagnostic system (RehaCAT) in cardiological and orthopaedic health clinics in routine care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Twelve participating rehabilitation clinics in Germany will be randomly assigned to a control (RehaCAT) or experimental group (RehaCAT+) in a 1:1 design. A total sample of 1848 participants will be recruited across all clinics. The primary outcome, depression severity at 12 months follow-up (T3), will be assessed using the CAT Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Emotional Distress-Depression Item set. Secondary outcomes are depression at discharge (T1) and 6 months follow-up (T2) as well as anxiety, satisfaction with participation in social roles and activities, pain impairment, fatigue, sleep, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, physical functioning, alcohol, personality and health economic-specific general quality of life and socioeconomic cost and benefits at T1-3. User behaviour, acceptance, facilitating and hindering factors will be assessed with semistructured qualitative interviews. Additionally, a smart sensing substudy will be conducted, with daily ecological momentary assessments and passive collection of smartphone usage variables. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle with additional per-protocol analyses. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted from a societal perspective and the perspective of the statutory pension insurance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee of Ulm University, has approved the study (on 24 February 2021 ref. 509/20). Written informed consent will be obtained for all participants. Results will be published via peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00027447.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Opioids may be necessary for guideline-concordant acute perioperative pain management, but their use carries risks for unintended prolonged use and addiction. Guidelines recommend use of validated non-pharmacological pain care (NPPC) approaches in conjunction with prescribed opioids and other analgesics. Our protocol outlines a population-level, pragmatic trial that will test a bundled intervention comprised of an electronic health record (EHR) portal-based conversation guide, EHR clinical decision support (CDS), and a suite of self-management educational and support materials to encourage and advance NPPC use. METHODS: We are conducting a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized pragmatic trial spanning seven surgical specialties across six geographically diverse locations within the Mayo Clinic Enterprise. Thirty two surgical practices across six locations (Rochester, Minnesota; Mankato, Minnesota; La Crosse, Wisconsin; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Phoenix, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida) comprise 22 distinct practice clusters that are randomly assigned to one of five steps using constrained randomization. Steps "go live" by initiating the intervention at 7-month intervals between March 2021 and July 2023. Patients over 18 years of age who are scheduled for qualifying procedures within "live" consenting practices are sent a Healing After Surgery guide via their patient portals pre-operatively, directing them to identify their preferred NPPC modalities among 13 approaches. These selections create CDS options for care teams to support patients with self-management materials that reinforce safe NPPC use. PLANNED OUTCOMES: Patients' clinical, demographic, and outcome data will be abstracted from the Epic EHR. Primary outcomes will be the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference and physical functioning computer adaptive tests (CAT) collected at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively via the patient portal. We will mail printed versions of the 6-item PROMIS short forms to portal non-responders to minimize bias. Secondary outcomes will include the PROMIS anxiety CAT, opioid consumption, and self-reported NPPC use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04570371.

AB  - We congratulate Dr. Nigel Stallard on his stimulating paper on adaptive enrichment designs with a continuous biomarker. Dr. Stallard details a framework for a large and interesting class of enrichment procedures. His work has motivated us to offer some thoughts in response. Dr. Stallard's strategy is to use the maximum of a test statistic over a set of possible threshold values to define the enriched population to be sampled in a second stage. This reminds us of procedures for identifying a change point, a biomarker value beyond which the effect of treatment is increased. For simplicity we focus our comments on Dr. Stallard's Rule 1 for selecting the second-stage sampling threshold. Using this rule, we present the likelihood ratio approach for adaptive testing and compare it to Dr. Stallard's approach for a few scenarios.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious mental health conditions (eg, anxiety and depression) are common in surgical patients, yet likely underassessed due to the time-consuming and cumbersome traditional screening process. A recently developed computerized adaptive mental health assessment tool (computerized adaptive test-mental health [CAT-MH]) allows rapid, precise, and accurate assessment of numerous mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, without the need for a trained interviewer. The goal of this investigation was to determine the feasibility of administering CAT-MH for anxiety and depression in the preoperative setting and to obtain preliminary evidence of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in preoperative patients. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 100 adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled and asked to complete the CAT-MH in the preoperative clinic. Urgent and emergency surgeries were excluded as were pregnant patients. Primary feasibility outcomes were completion rate and time to completion. Secondary outcomes were prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: All 100 enrolled patients completed the study. All patients were able to complete the mental health assessment (mean time: 3.6 +/- 1.8 minutes standard deviation). Sixteen patients (16%) screened positive for anxiety (severity: mild, n = 7 [7%]; moderate, n = 7 [7%]); severe, n = 2 [2%]); 12 of 16 (75%) did not have a previous diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Twenty-eight (28%) patients screened positive for depression (severity: mild, n = 26 [26%]; moderate and severe, n = 1 each [1%]); 23 of 28 (82%) had no previous diagnosis of depressive disorder. Nineteen patients (19%) met the screening criteria for major depressive disorder; 14 of 19 (74%) of which had no previous diagnosis of major depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study support the feasibility of using CAT-MH in a preoperative evaluation and indicate that there is a substantial prevalence of undiagnosed anxiety and depression in surgical patients.

AB  - Itch compromises QOL, but most itch assessments focus only on itch intensity. We aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatric measure for itch symptoms and itch impact, defined as the effect specifically of itch on physical, mental, and social health, all of which can affect life quality. After literature review, concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with parents and children with itch, and repeated content-expert review, an item pool was generated and refined. The pool was calibrated with data from 499 children with pruritus using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, item response theory, and item fit analysis. The resultant 45-item bank, PROMIS Itch Questionnaire-Child (PIQ-C), showed good convergent and discriminant validity in 181 children aged 817 years, discriminating children with different levels of severity, and was responsive to change. Strong correlations (rho >/= 0.60) were observed with pain and sleep measures, and moderate correlations were observed with other pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Itch Questionnaire-Child comprehensively measures itch intensity and burden, providing an itch-specific alternative for assessing life quality. The independent calibration of each item/question allows for flexibility in generating short forms or computerized adaptive testing for efficient use in research and office practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are differences in roles between the more-affected and less-affected upper limb of children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, there is a lack of studies of the relationship between the more-affected limb function and activities of daily living (ADL) in children with CP. Thus, the aim of this prospective cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between more-affected upper limb function and ADL in children with CP. METHODS: Children with spastic CP (unilateral CP n = 28, bilateral CP n = 31; 34 males, 25 females; mean age +/- SD, 6.8 +/- 3.1y [range, 3-14y]) participated in this study. Function of the more-affected upper limb was measured using the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper limb Function, version 2 (MA2) and the Upper Limb Physician's Rating Scale (ULPRS). Performance of daily living activities was measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT). RESULTS: The range, accuracy and fluency dimension of MA2 and ULPRS total scores were moderately correlated with the daily activity domain (r = 0.47, 0.47, 0.56 for MA2 and r = 0.50 for ULPRS, respectively; P < 0.001) rather than the mobility, social/cognitive, and responsibility domains of the PEDI-CAT. ULPRS scores for elbow extension, supination in extension, supination in flexion, and two-handed function were moderately correlated with the PEDI-CAT daily activity domain (r = 0.44, 0.43, 0.41, and 0.49, respectively; P < 0.01). Finger opening and thumb-in-palm deformity of the ULPRS did not correlate with any PEDI-CAT domain. CONCLUSIONS: The MA2 range, accuracy, and fluency domains (rather than dexterity) had the strongest correlations with the PEDI-CAT daily activity domain. Elbow extension, forearm supination, and two-handed function (rather than wrist and finger movements) of the ULPRS had the strongest correlations with the PEDI-CAT daily activity domain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with traditional screening questionnaires, computerised adaptive tests for severity of depression (CAT-DI) and computerised adaptive diagnostic modules for depression (CAD-MDD) show improved precision in screening for major depressive disorder. CAT measures have been tailored to perinatal women but have not been studied in low-income women of colour despite high rates of perinatal depression (PND). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the concordance between CAT and traditional measures of depression in a sample of primarily low-income black and Latina women. METHODS: In total, 373 women (49% black; 29% Latina) completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), CAD-MDD and CAT-DI at 845 visits across pregnancy and postpartum. We examined the concordance between continuous CAT-DI and PHQ-9 scores and between binary measures of PND diagnosis on CAD-MDD and the PHQ-9 (cut-off score >10). We examined cases with a positive PND diagnosis on the CAD-MDD but not on the PHQ-9 ('missed' cases) to determine whether clinic notes were consistent with CAD-MDD results. FINDINGS: CAT-DI and PHQ-9 scores were significantly associated (concordance correlation coefficient=0.67; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.74). CAD-MDD detected 5% more case of PND compared with PHQ-9 (p<0.001). The average per-visit rate of PND was 14.4% (14.5% in blacks, 14.9% in Latinas) on the CAD-MDD, and 9.5% (9.8% in blacks, 8.8% in Latinas) on the PHQ-9. Clinical notes were available on 60% of 'missed' cases and validated CAD-MDD PND diagnosis in 89% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: CAD-MDD detected 5% more cases of PND in women of colour compared with traditional tests, and the majority of these cases were verified by clinician notes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of CAT in routine clinic care may address health disparities in PND screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are important for understanding recovery after burn injury, benchmarking service delivery and measuring the impact of interventions. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 domains have been validated for use among diverse populations though not among burn survivors. The purpose of this study was to examine validity and reliability of PROMIS-29 scores in this population. METHODS: The PROMIS-29 scores of physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles, and pain interference were evaluated for validity and reliability in adult burn survivors. Unidimensionality, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, and reliability were examined. Differential item functioning was used to examine bias with respect to demographic and injury characteristics. Correlations with measures of related constructs (Community Integration Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian, and Veteran's Rand-12) and known-group differences were examined. RESULTS: Eight hundred and seventy-six burn survivors with moderate to severe injury from 6 months to 20 years postburn provided responses on PROMIS-29 domains. Participants' ages ranged from 18 years to 93 years at time of assessment; mean years since injury was 3.4. All PROMIS domain scores showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87-0.97). There was a large ceiling effect on ability to participate in social roles (39.7%) and physical function (43.3%). One-factor confirmatory factor analyses supported unidimensionality (all comparative fit indices >0.95). We found no statistically significant bias (differential item functioning). Reliability was high (>0.9) across trait levels for all domains except sleep, which reached moderate reliability (>0.85). All known-group differences by demographic and clinical characteristics were in the hypothesized direction and magnitude except burn size categories. CONCLUSION: The results provide strong evidence for reliability and validity of PROMIS-29 domain scores among adult burn survivors. Reliability of the extreme scores could be increased and the ceiling effects reduced by administering PROMIS-43, which includes six items per domain, or by administering by computerized adaptive testing.

AB  - Geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures have been used extensively in recent decades due to their significant advantages over more conventional earth retaining structures, including the cost-effectiveness, reduced construction time, and possibility of using locally-available lower quality soils and/or waste materials, such as recycled construction and demolition (C&D) wastes. The time-dependent shear behaviour at the interfaces between the geosynthetic and the backfill is an important factor affecting the overall long-term performance of such structures, and thereby should be properly understood. In this study, an innovative multistage direct shear test procedure is introduced to characterise the time-dependent response of the interface between a high-strength geotextile and a recycled C&D material. After a prescribed shear displacement is reached, the shear box is kept stationary for a specific period of time, after which the test proceeds again, at a constant displacement rate, until the peak and large-displacement shear strengths are mobilised. The shear stress-shear displacement curves from the proposed multistage tests exhibited a progressive decrease in shear stress with time (stress relaxation) during the period in which the shear box was restrained from any movement, which was more pronounced under lower normal stress values. Regardless of the prior interface shear displacement and duration of the stress relaxation stage, the peak and residual shear strength parameters of the C&D material-geotextile interface remained similar to those obtained from the conventional (benchmark) tests carried out under constant displacement rate.

AB  - Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), tools to assess patient self-report of health status, are now increasingly used in research, care and policymaking. While there are two well-developed disease-specific PROMs for interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), many unmet and urgent needs remain. In December 2019, 64 international ILD experts convened in Erice, Italy to deliberate on many topics, including PROMs in ILD. This review summarises the history of PROMs in ILD, shortcomings of the existing tools, challenges of development, validation and implementation of their use in clinical trials, and the discussion held during the meeting. Development of disease-specific PROMs for ILD including IPF with robust methodology and validation in concordance with guidance from regulatory authorities have increased user confidence in PROMs. Minimal clinically important difference for bidirectional changes may need to be developed. Cross-cultural validation and linguistic adaptations are necessary in addition to robust psychometric properties for effective PROM use in multinational clinical trials. PROM burden of use should be reduced through appropriate use of digital technologies and computerised adaptive testing. Active patient engagement in all stages from development, testing, choosing and implementation of PROMs can help improve probability of success and further growth.

AB  - AIM: This case report was designed to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation on improving upper extremity function for a child with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. METHODS: In addition to conventional therapies completed three times per week, the participant engaged in virtual reality rehabilitation with the Neofect Smart Kids five to seven days per week for six weeks totaling just over twelve hours of intervention time. Outcome measures were administered pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6-weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: Varying levels of improvement in motor function, quality of movement, and functional use were observed during intervention evidenced by improved scores on the following standardized assessments: Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, Second Edition; the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test; and the Pediatric Evaluation and Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test. The participant maintained improvements in motor skills at 6-weeks post intervention, however, the quality of his movements and overall frequency of use with his affected upper extremity decreased in the 6-weeks following termination of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the results are not generalizable, the VR intervention for this child allowed for greater movement repetition and improved functional upper extremity use.

AB  - Despite its widespread use and low complication rates, arthroscopic meniscectomy has not been uniformly successful in all patients, especially in those with concurrent osteoarthritis. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health to develop and validate patient-reported outcomes for clinical research and practice. PROMIS has shown the ability to enhance and standardize measurement of a variety of health domains affecting musculoskeletal function and in discriminating between various orthopaedic procedures through the use of computer adaptive testing. Preoperative PROMIS scores are valid predictors of postoperative minimal clinically important difference in patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy based on preoperative decreased physical function and increased pain interference. PROMIS score cutoffs may be used by arthroscopic surgeons to counsel patients considering arthroscopic meniscectomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe relationships between negative emotions and perceived emotional support in parents of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study conducted face-to-face interviews between January 2019 and January 2020. Study variables included depression (PHQ-9 Scale), anxiety (Emotional Distress-Anxiety-Short Form 8a), anger (Emotional Distress-Anger-Short Form 5a), fear (Fear-Affect Computerized Adaptive Test), somatic fear (Fear-Somatic Arousal-Fixed Form), loneliness (Revised 20-item UCLA Loneliness Scale), and perceived emotional support (Emotional Support-Fixed Form). RESULTS: Eighty parents reported symptoms of depression 8.00(4.00, 13.75), anxiety (23.43 +/- 7.80), anger (13.40 +/- 5.46), fear (72.81 +/- 27.26), somatic fear 9.00(6.00, 12.75), loneliness (39.35 +/- 12.00), and low perceived emotional support (32.14 +/- 8.06). Parents who were young, single, low-income, and with limited-post secondary education reported greater loneliness and lower perceived emotional support. Fear correlated with depression (r = 0.737, P < 0.01) and anxiety (r=0.900, P < 0.01). Inverse relationships were discovered between perceived emotional support and loneliness (r = -0.767, P < 0.01), anger (r=-0.401, P < 0.01), and depression (r = -0.334, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of negative emotions identified will serve as potential targets for future interventions designed to enhance support for parents of critically ill children.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the increasing incidence of orthopaedic surgeries, there is a lack of data reporting on patient experience and recovery following surgery. As such, there is a need to better characterize the natural history of pain interference (PI) after orthopaedic surgery to better manage patients' expectations and recovery. PURPOSE: To identify factors associated with greater pain interference two weeks following orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: All patients undergoing elective outpatient orthopaedic surgery at a single urban academic institution were evaluated preoperatively from August 2016 to March 2018. Patients completed a baseline assessment consisting of demographic information, PROMIS computer adaptive testing in 6 domains including Pain Interference (PI), Physical Function, Social Satisfaction, Fatigue, Anxiety, and Depression. Two weeks following surgery, patients completed the same questionnaires along with assessments of Improvement and Satisfaction. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed. Categorical data was compared with ANOVA and continuous data was compared with Spearman's correlation coefficient (r(s)). RESULTS: 435 patients (age = 41.1 +/- 15.7, 47% female) were studied. Mean PI was 60.1 +/- 7.0 prior to surgery and 61.7 +/- 7.6 at 2 weeks postoperative. Worse 2 week PROMIS PI was associated with lower extremity surgery, prior surgery on the joint, preoperative opioid use, depression, lower income, lower education, and higher ASA score (p < 0.05). Better 2 week PROMIS PI was correlated with better baseline and better 2 week scores on all outcome measures. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that lower extremity surgery, worse preoperative pain scores, and worse preoperative pain interference were independent predictors of worse pain interference after surgery. CONCLUSION: Early postoperative pain interference is associated with function, demographic, and psychosocial factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in activity intolerance for a given musculoskeletal pathophysiology. In other words, people often experience illness beyond what one would expect given their level of pathophysiology. Mental health (i.e., cognitive bias regarding pain [e.g., worst-case thinking] and psychological distress [symptoms of anxiety and depression]) is an important and treatable correlate of pain intensity and activity intolerance that accounts for much of this variation. This study tested the degree to which psychological distress accentuates the role of cognitive bias in the relationship between pain intensity and activity intolerance. METHODS: We enrolled 125 adults with musculoskeletal illness in a cross-sectional study. Participants completed measures of activity intolerance related to pain (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Pain Interference Computer Adaptive Test [CAT]) and in general (PROMIS Physical Function CAT]), measures of psychological distress (PROMIS Depression CAT and PROMIS Anxiety CAT), a numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain intensity, measures of pain-related cognitive bias (4-question versions of the Negative Pain Thoughts Questionnaire [NPTQ-4], Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS-4], and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia [TSK-4]), and a survey of demographic variables. We assessed the relationships of these measures through mediation and moderation analyses using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Mediation analysis confirmed the large indirect relationship between pain intensity (NRS) and activity intolerance (PROMIS Pain Interference CAT and Physical Function CAT) through cognitive bias. Symptoms of depression and anxiety had an unconditional (consistent) relationship with cognitive bias (NPTQ), but there was no significant conditional effect/moderation (i.e., no increase in the magnitude of the relationship with increasing symptoms of depression and anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress accentuates the role of cognitive bias in the relationship between pain intensity and activity intolerance. In other words, misconceptions make humans ill, more so with greater symptoms of depression or anxiety. Orthopaedic surgeons can approach their daily work with the knowledge that addressing common misconceptions and identifying psychological distress as a health improvement opportunity are important aspects of musculoskeletal care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative patient expectations and met expectations are likely associated with the outcome of treatment. However, there is a lack of data regarding the preoperative expectations and early postoperative met expectations of patients undergoing extremity orthopaedic surgery. The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of early postoperative met expectations in a cohort of patients undergoing extremity orthopaedic surgery and to assess the relationship between patient expectations and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. We hypothesized that patients with higher preoperative expectation scores and higher postoperative met expectation scores would have better early postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Four hundred thirty-five patients age seventeen and older who underwent extremity orthopaedic surgery at one institution were prospectively enrolled in this study. Each patient completed a preoperative questionnaire that included an assessment of demographics, pain, function, general health, treatment expectations, activity level, and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing. Expectations were evaluated using the Expectations Domain of the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System (MODEMS) questionnaire. Patients completed a follow-up questionnaire two weeks after surgery that also assessed MODEMS met expectations and satisfaction (Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8)). RESULTS: The mean preoperative expectation score was 86.95 +/- 16.59, and the mean postoperative met expectation score was 55.02 +/- 27.63 (0-100 scale with 100 representing the highest level of expectations). Greater met expectations were significantly associated with white race (p = 0.025), college degree (p = 0.011), and higher income (p = 0.002). Greater met expectations were also significantly associated with greater postoperative physical function, social satisfaction, activity level, and subjective improvement, as well as lower pain interference, joint pain, body pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.01 for each). Multivariable analysis results found that less postoperative joint pain and greater postoperative social satisfaction, improvement, and physical function were all significant independent predictors of greater met expectations at two weeks postoperative (p < 0.01 for each). CONCLUSION: Greater preoperative expectations are associated with better activity and less pain two weeks after surgery. Met expectations of extremity orthopaedic surgery were associated with postoperative physical function, social satisfaction, activity, pain, anxiety, depression, and subjective improvement. These results may have implications for preoperative counseling and risk factor modification.

AB  - Bronchiolitis is a common pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) illness and often affects generally healthy children, making it a promising disease in which to study long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We previously found that approximately 15% of critical bronchiolitis patients have evidence of post-PICU morbidity using coarse definitions available in administrative data sets. In this study, we measured neurodevelopmental outcomes using four more precise tools. Children who had previously been admitted to our PICU with bronchiolitis were included; those with evidence of developmental delay at PICU admission were excluded. Approximately 1 to 2 years after PICU discharge, the parent of each subject completed two questionnaires (Ages and Stages Questionnaire and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test). Each subject also underwent two in-person assessments administered by a certified examiner (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition, and the Amiel-Tison neurological assessment). For each domain of each test, a score of > 1 standard deviation below the norm for the subject's age defined "moderate" disability and a score >/= 2 standard deviations below the norm defined "severe" disability. Eighteen subjects (median ages of 3.7 months at PICU admission and 2.3 years at testing) were enrolled, 17 of whom were supported by high-flow nasal cannula and/or mechanical ventilation. Fifteen children (83%) scored abnormally on >/= 1test. Eight children (44%) had disabilities in >/= 3 domains and/or >/= 1 severe disability identified. Our findings that motor, language, and cognitive disabilities are commonly observed months to years after critical bronchiolitis require larger studies to confirm this finding, assess causality, and identify modifiable risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prechtl's general movements assessment (GMA) post-term has high predictive validity for cerebral palsy, but less is known about whether earlier GMA, including before term, are associated with other developmental problems. AIMS: To examine the relationships between GMA prior to term and at term-equivalent, with developmental outcomes at 4.5-5 years' corrected age. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: 122 very preterm infants born <30 weeks' gestation and 91 healthy term controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: GMA (categorised as 'normal' or 'abnormal') were assessed at <32, 32-33 and 34-36 weeks' postmenstrual age for the preterm infants, and at term-equivalent for both groups. Children were assessed at 4.5-5 years' corrected age using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd edition (MABC-2), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Little Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (Little DCD-Q) and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV (WPPSI-IV). RESULTS: Prior to term, abnormal GMA at the first two timepoints were associated with lower scores on the Little DCD-Q, and abnormal GMA at the second and third timepoints with lower quality of life scores and PEDI-CAT mobility domain scores. Abnormal GMA at term-equivalent were associated with lower MABC-2, mobility and quality of life scores for preterm infants, and worse social/cognitive domain scores for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal GMA prior to term and at term-equivalent are associated with worse motor, functional and cognitive outcomes at 4.5-5 years' corrected age, and may be useful to identify infants for developmental surveillance/early intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Objective (SES) and subjective socioeconomic status (SSS) affect symptom intensity and magnitude of limitations. Identification of potentially modifiable social risk factors might contribute to additional opportunities for optimizing musculoskeletal health. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) There are no correlations between magnitude of limitations (as measured with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function [PROMIS PF computer adaptive test]) and components of SES or SSS in people with musculoskeletal disease; (2) There are no factors (including level of social deprivation) independently associated with PROMIS PF. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients presenting to clinicians specializing in the treatment of a broad variety of musculoskeletal conditions were prospectively enrolled in the study. We recorded patient demographics and assessed patients' socioeconomic status using the MacArthur Sociodemographic questionnaire and physical disability rating using PROMIS PF. Patients deprivation index was retrieved using their 9-digit ZIP codes. We used bivariate analysis to determine correlations between magnitude of limitations and socioeconomic status. We created a stepwise backward multivariable linear regression model to assess factors independently associated with PROMIS PF. RESULTS: Weak correlations were found on bivariate analysis of PROMIS PF with SSS measured as "Place in community" (r 0.28; P < 0.001) and "Place in the United States of America" (r 0.25; P = 0.002). In the multivariable models, the area deprivation index was not independently associated with physical limitations. Male gender (beta regression coefficient [beta] 4.1; 95% CI 0.71 to 7.5; P = 0.018) and having net worth of $5000 - $19,999 (beta 6.3; 95% CI 0.35 to 12; P = 0.038) or $20,000 - $99,999 (beta 5.8; 95% CI 2.1 to 9.5; P = 0.003) when compared to having net worth of less than $4999 were independently associated with better physical function. Being unemployed or disabled and keeping house, being a student, or retired were independently associated with worse physical function (beta -12; 95% CI -18 to -7.0; P < 0.001; beta -5.6; 95% CI -9.9 to -1.4; P = 0.009, respectively), when compared to working full-time or part-time. CONCLUSIONS: Objective and subjective measures of socioeconomic status are associated with magnitude of physical limitations in patients with musculoskeletal illness. These factors should be considered when developing treatment plans for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II prognostic study.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to correlate the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing (CAT) domains with commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) preoperatively in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care orthopedic center for biceps and labral pathology. METHODS: Prospective data were collected on 175 patients scheduled to undergo isolated biceps tenodesis at a tertiary center. Enrollees completed legacy scores (Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey, Short Form 12, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] Assessment Form, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and Constant-Murley score) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (Upper Extremity [UE], Pain Interference [PIF], and Depression). In addition, patients were asked to provide an assessment of the strength, function, and pain of the affected shoulder using a custom visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire. Spearman rank correlations of the PROMIS CAT with legacy measures and the custom VAS were calculated. Floor and ceiling effects were assessed. RESULTS: The UE CAT yielded moderate correlations with the ASES score (r = 0.57) and the custom VAS strength score (r = 0.50-0.57). The PIF CAT demonstrated moderate correlations with the VAS pain score (r = 0.45) and high-moderate correlations with the ASES score, VR6D score, and UE CAT (r = 0.61-0.66). The Depression CAT demonstrated high-moderate correlations with the mental health legacy measures (r = -0.64 to -0.61). There was a significant relative floor effect for the Depression CAT at a score of 34.2 (19%). CONCLUSION: The PIF CAT was comparable to the ASES score, the current gold standard. Compared with legacy measures, both the UE CAT and PIF CAT are less burdensome and have few floor or ceiling effects. The PIF CAT may be a viable alternative to describe the physical and psychosocial impact of pain in biceps tenodesis patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study is to understand how listeners with and without sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) use energy and temporal envelope cues to detect tones in noise. Previous studies of low-frequency tone-in-noise detection have shown that when energy cues are made less reliable using a roving-level paradigm, thresholds of listeners with normal hearing (NH) are only slightly increased. This result is consistent with studies demonstrating the importance of temporal envelope cues for masked detection. In contrast, roving-level detection thresholds are more elevated in listeners with SNHL at the test frequency, suggesting stronger weighting of energy cues. The present study extended these tests to a wide range of frequencies and stimulus levels. The authors hypothesized that individual listeners with SNHL use energy and temporal envelope cues differently for masked detection at different frequencies and levels, depending on the degree of hearing loss. DESIGN: Twelve listeners with mild to moderate SNHL and 12 NH listeners participated. Tone-in-noise detection thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in 1/3 octave bands of simultaneously gated Gaussian noise were obtained using a novel, two-part tracking paradigm. A track refers to the sequence of trials in an adaptive test procedure; the signal to noise ratio was the tracked variable. Each part of the track consisted of a two-alternative, two-interval, forced-choice procedure. The initial portion of the track estimated detection threshold using a fixed masker level. When the track continued, stimulus levels were randomly varied over a 20-dB rove range (+/-10 dB with respect to mean masker level), and a second threshold was estimated. Rove effect (RE) was defined as the difference between thresholds for the fixed- and roving-level tests. The size of the RE indicated how strongly a listener weighted energy-based cues for masked detection. Participants were tested at one to three masker levels per frequency, depending on audibility. RESULTS: Across all stimulus frequencies and levels, NH listeners had small REs ( approximately 1 dB), whereas listeners with SNHL typically had larger REs. Some listeners with SNHL had larger REs at higher frequencies, where pure-tone audiometric thresholds were typically elevated. RE did not vary significantly with masker level for either group. Increased RE for the SNHL group was consistent with simulations in which energy cues were more heavily weighted than envelope cues. CONCLUSIONS: Tone-in-noise detection thresholds in NH listeners were typically elevated only slightly by the roving-level paradigm at any frequency or level tested, consistent with the primary use of level-independent cues, such as temporal envelope cues that are conveyed by fluctuations in neural responses. In comparison, thresholds of listeners with SNHL were more affected by the roving-level paradigm, suggesting stronger weighting of energy cues. For listeners with SNHL, the largest RE was observed at 4000 Hz, for which pure-tone audiometric thresholds were most elevated. Specifically, RE size at 4000 Hz was significantly correlated with higher pure-tone audiometric thresholds at the same frequency, after controlling for the effect of age. Future studies will explore strategies for restoring or enhancing neural fluctuation cues that may lead to improved hearing in noise for listeners with SNHL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intolerance of uncertainty-the tendency to overestimate the chance of and be unwilling to accept potential, but unlikely, negative outcomes in uncertain situations-is a cognitive construct that has been shown to affect symptoms and limitations for patients with traumatic and nontraumatic upper-extremity conditions. Cognitive flexibility and tolerance of uncertainty can be trained and practiced, with the potential to increase musculoskeletal health. However, to our knowledge, the degree to which intolerance of uncertainty might be associated with symptom intensity and the magnitude of limitations in adults with upper-extremity problems has not been characterized. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: After accounting for personal and social factors, is intolerance of uncertainty independently associated with (1) the magnitude of physical limitations and (2) pain intensity? METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational study, 139 new and returning patients presenting to one of four orthopaedic offices in a large urban area completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (a validated measure of the level of comfort with uncertain situations), the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Physical Function Upper Extremity computer adaptive test (to measure the magnitude of limitations), and an 11-point ordinal measure of pain intensity. The mean age of the 139 participants was 51 years +/- 16 years and 55% (76 of 139) were men. Participants presented to the clinics with a wide variety of upper-extremity conditions, such as trigger finger, distal radius fractures, lateral epicondylitis, or non-specific shoulder pain. We also assessed sex, race, marital status, education level, income, public versus private insurance, area deprivation index, and the participant's self-perception of their healthcare experience through a multiple-choice question (answer choices: none, some, a little, and a lot of experience). The following patient characteristics were more common in our study participants: white, employed, part of a married or unmarried couple, and private insurance coverage. We created two multivariable linear regression models to assess factors independently associated with the magnitude of limitations and pain intensity. RESULTS: After controlling for potentially confounding variables including sex, insurance, area deprivation index, and type of visit, we found that fewer physical limitations were associated with a greater intolerance of uncertainty (regression coefficient [beta] -0.30; 95% confidence interval, -0.50 to -0.10; p = 0.003; semi-partial r = 0.07; adjusted r for the full model = 0.16), as was being a man (beta 3.2; 95% CI, 0.08-6.3; p = 0.045; semi-partial r = 0.03) and having private insurance coverage (beta 5.2; 95% CI, 2.1-8.2; p = 0.001; semi-partial r = 0.08). After controlling for one important potentially confounding variable, the level of education, greater pain intensity was associated with a greater intolerance of uncertainty (beta 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.14; p = 0.009; semi-partial r = 0.05; adjusted r for the full model = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Intolerance of uncertainty-a byproduct of cognitive bias and error, which are elements of the normal functioning of the human mind-increases limitations and pain intensity across diagnoses, independent of demographic and social factors. Future studies can address the effect of strategies that incorporate mindset training (for example, cognitive behavioral therapy and its derivatives) on musculoskeletal symptoms and limitations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of 8 pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) item banks in a clinical sample of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: A total of 154 Dutch children (mean +/- SD age 14.4 +/- 3.0 years; range 8-18 years) with JIA completed 8 pediatric version 1.0 PROMIS item banks (anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, pain interference, peer relationships, physical function mobility, physical function upper extremity) twice and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ) once. Structural validity of the item banks was assessed by fitting a graded response model (GRM) and inspecting GRM fit (comparative fit index [CFI], Tucker-Lewis index [TLI], and root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]) and item fit (S-X(2) statistic). Convergent validity (with PedsQL/C-HAQ subdomains) and discriminative validity (active/inactive disease) were assessed. Reliability of the item banks, short forms, and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was expressed as the SE of theta (SE[theta]). Test-retest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and smallest detectable change. RESULTS: All item banks had sufficient overall GRM fit (CFI >0.95, TLI >0.95, RMSEA <0.08) and no item misfit (all S-X(2) P > 0.001). High correlations (>0.70) were found between most PROMIS T scores and hypothesized PedsQL/C-HAQ (sub)domains. Mobility, pain interference, and upper extremity item banks were able to discriminate between patients with active and inactive disease. Regarding reliability, PROMIS item banks outperformed legacy instruments. Post hoc CAT simulations outperformed short forms. Test-retest reliability was strong (ICC >0.70) for all full-length item banks and short forms, except for the peer relationships item bank. CONCLUSION: The pediatric PROMIS item banks displayed sufficient psychometric properties for Dutch children with JIA. PROMIS item banks are ready for use in clinical research and practice for children with JIA.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To (1) confirm validity of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function and pain interference computer-adaptive tests (CATs) and (2) assess the validity of PROMIS Global Health (GH) and five additional PROMIS CATs: social role satisfaction, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance in a population of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) who completed a 3-month Interdisciplinary Pain Program (IPP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent recommendations for assessing outcomes in patients with cLBP have included PROMIS scales; however, there is a need for further evaluation, and PROMIS GH has not been studied in this population. METHODS: The study cohort included patients with cLBP who completed the entirety of a 3-month IPP between August 2016 and December 2018. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were analyzed before the start of the IPP and at graduation. Convergent and discriminant validity were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Known groups' validity assessed the change in PROMIS scores stratified by improvement on the Modified LBP Disability Questionnaire. Responsiveness was evaluated with standardized response means based on global impression of change. RESULTS: IPP was completed by 217 patients (67.7% women, age 53.8 +/- 12.8). Convergent validity was supported (P < 0.01 for all pairwise PROMs comparisons). All PROMs improved significantly by graduation, with the largest improvement for PROMIS pain interference, physical function, social role satisfaction, and Modified LBP Disability Questionnaire. Known groups' validity demonstrated the greatest change on PROMIS physical function, social role satisfaction, pain interference, and depression. Responsiveness was supported for all PROMs in 170 (78.3%) patients who indicated at least minimal improvement (standardized response means 0.43-1.06). CONCLUSION: Our study provides support of PROMIS CATs, highlights the importance of including other meaningful outcome measures, such as social role satisfaction, and provides the first validation of PROMIS GH, in patients with cLBP. PROMs collection can be streamlined through the use of PROMIS CATs which offer advantages over legacy measures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent literature on the adaptive assessment of complex mental health disorders and provide a detailed comparison of classical test theory and adaptive testing based on multidimensional item response theory. RECENT FINDINGS: Adaptive tests for a wide variety of mental health traits (e.g., depression, anxiety, mania, substance misuse, suicidality) are now available in a cloud-based environment. These tests have been validated in a variety of settings against lengthy structured clinical interviews with excellent results and even higher reliability than fixed-length tests. Applications include screening and assessments in emergency departments, psychiatric and primary care clinics, student health clinics, perinatal medicine clinics, child welfare settings, and the judicial system. The future of mental health measurement will be based on automated screening and assessments. Adaptive tests will provide increased precision of measurement and decreased burden of measurement. Integration into the electronic health record is important and now easily accomplished.

AB  - Genetic variants associated with disease outcomes can be used to develop personalized treatment. To reach this precision medicine goal, hundreds of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in the past decade to search for promising genetic variants associated with various traits. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However, in total these identified variants explain only part of the variation for most complex traits. There remain many genetic variants with small effect sizes to be discovered, which calls for the development of (a) GWAS with more samples and more comprehensively genotyped variants, for example, the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is planning to conduct whole genome sequencing on over 100 000 individuals; and (b) novel and more powerful statistical analysis methods. The current dominating GWAS analysis approach is the "single trait" association test, despite the fact that many GWAS are conducted in deeply phenotyped cohorts including many correlated and well-characterized outcomes, which can help improve the power to detect novel variants if properly analyzed, as suggested by increasing evidence that pleiotropy, where a genetic variant affects multiple traits, is the norm in genome-phenome associations. We aim to develop pleiotropy informed powerful association test methods across multiple traits for GWAS. Since it is generally very hard to access individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data for those existing GWAS, due to privacy concerns and various logistical considerations, we develop rigorous statistical methods for pleiotropy informed adaptive multitrait association test methods that need only summary association statistics publicly available from most GWAS. We first develop a pleiotropy test, which has powerful performance for truly pleiotropic variants but is sensitive to the pleiotropy assumption. We then develop a pleiotropy informed adaptive test that has robust and powerful performance under various genetic models. We develop accurate and efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-value for the proposed adaptive test without the need of resampling or permutation. We illustrate the performance of proposed methods through application to joint association test of GWAS meta-analysis summary data for several glycemic traits. Our proposed adaptive test identified several novel loci missed by individual trait based GWAS meta-analysis. All the proposed methods are implemented in a publicly available R package.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the authors demonstrate to spine surgeons the prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression among patients presenting for surgery and explore the relationships between different legacy and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) screening measures. METHODS: A total of 512 adult spine surgery patients at a single institution completed the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7), 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression scale, and PROMIS Anxiety and Depression computer-adaptive tests (CATs) preoperatively. Correlation coefficients were calculated between PROMIS scores and GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores. Published reference tables were used to determine the presence of anxiety or depression using GAD-7 and PHQ-8. Sensitivity and specificity of published guidance on the PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were compared. Guidance from 3 sources was compared: published GAD-7 and PHQ-8 crosswalk tables, American Psychiatric Association scales, and expert clinical consensus. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine data-driven cut-points for PROMIS Anxiety and Depression. Significance was accepted as p < 0.05. RESULTS: In 512 spine surgery patients, anxiety and depression were prevalent preoperatively (55% with any anxiety, 24% with generalized anxiety screen-positive; and 54% with any depression, 24% with probable major depression). Correlations were moderately strong between PROMIS Anxiety and GAD-7 scores (r = 0.72; p < 0.001) and between PROMIS Depression and PHQ-8 scores (r = 0.74; p < 0.001). The observed correlation of the PROMIS Depression score was greater with the PHQ-8 cognitive/affective score (r = 0.766) than with the somatic score (r = 0.601) (p < 0.001). PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were able to detect the presence of generalized anxiety screen-positive (sensitivity, 86.0%; specificity, 81.6%) and of probable major depression (sensitivity, 82.3%; specificity, 81.4%). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated data-driven cut-points for these groups. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs are reliable tools for identifying generalized anxiety screen-positive spine surgery patients and those with probable major depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assessment includes computerized adaptive tests (CATs) that assess function, pain, depression, and anxiety. The influence of mental health on patients' self-reported pain and function has not been explored using PROMIS in patients with symptomatic glenohumeral osteoarthritis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 284 shoulders in 276 patients presenting with isolated glenohumeral osteoarthritis. All patients completed the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), and PROMIS CATs at the time of presentation. PROMIS anxiety and depression scores were converted into Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores, respectively, using the PROsetta Stone "crosswalk" tool. Mean pain and functional scores were compared between patients with and without PROMIS-converted scores corresponding to a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, as well as between scores corresponding to varying degrees of anxiety or depression. RESULTS: Patients with scores corresponding to a diagnosis of anxiety or depression reported lower functional and higher pain scores compared to those with scores in the normal range (P < .001). Analysis of variance showed progressively lower functional and higher pain scores as anxiety severity increased (P < .001). Similar results were seen with ASES, upper extremity CAT, and pain scores as depression severity increased (P < .001). Functional ASES (P = .004), SST (P < .001), and physical function CAT (P = .002) scores were statistically significantly lower in patients with moderate to severe depression than those without depression or with mild depression. DISCUSSION: In patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis, PROMIS-reported anxiety and depression scores, particularly in those with moderate-to-severe scores, correlate with lower functional and higher pain scores. Further investigation is necessary to examine the influence that mental health has on outcomes after operative intervention in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Auditory processing (AP) is commonly regarded as the perceptual processing of auditory information in the central nervous system. However, the degree to which higher level cognitive processes are involved in AP or its disorders is contentious. Furthermore, there is little evidence regarding the effects of nonauditory cognitive processes on the various tests of AP in common clinical usage and thus on clinical diagnoses of auditory processing disorder. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of increased cognitive demand, generated by using a dual-task paradigm, on performance on different AP tests and types of AP tests in common clinical usage. In addition, to investigate the relationship between executive function and changes in AP test performance associated with increased cognitive demand. RESEARCH DESIGN: Counterbalanced repeated measures design, with assessment of AP test performance both on its own and in a dual-task paradigm designed to increase cognitive demand. STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-nine young adults, with no reported hearing, learning, language or attention difficulties, English as first language, and hearing and middle-ear status within normal limits. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Testing was completed within a single 90-min session. A selection of standard AP tests, representing both adaptive and nonadaptive tests, as well as tests employing difference scores, was administered. These were Competing Sentences Test, Dichotic Digits Test, Frequency Pattern Test (nonadaptive tests); and Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences test, conditions "same-voice, 0 degrees ", "different-voice, 0 degrees ", and "same-voice, 90 degrees " (adaptive tests), from which the difference scores "talker advantage" and "spatial advantage" were also derived. Each AP test was completed on its own (alone condition), and simultaneously with a visually presented task (dual-task condition). Executive function was assessed using the phonemic subtest of the Verbal Fluency Test. Nonparametric statistical test procedures were used. RESULTS: All five AP measures obtained from the nonadaptive tests showed a significant performance decrement in the dual-task condition compared with the alone condition, with one exception because of a strong ceiling effect. By contrast, none of the three AP measures obtained from the adaptive tests showed a significant performance decrement in the dual-task condition. Furthermore, neither of the two AP measures based on difference scores showed a significant performance decrement, but this finding simply reflects the lack of significant decrements in the relevant raw scores. Consistent with past reports of associations between executive function and AP performance, a significant positive correlation was found between executive function scores and performance on the Dichotic Digits Test. However, there were no significant correlations between executive function scores and changes in AP test scores between alone and dual-task conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Performance on commonly used nonadaptive tests of AP was significantly compromised by the increased cognitive demand resulting from the dual-task paradigm. By contrast, performance on AP measures obtained by adaptive test procedures was not significantly affected. Further investigation of the resilience to increased cognitive demand of the adaptive tests used here, and other adaptive tests of AP, is warranted. Results from this study support the further development of computerized adaptive tests of AP for use in clinical test batteries.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new measure of caregiver strain for use in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Caregiver Strain. DESIGN: Qualitative data, literature reviews, and cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of civilians (n=344) or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain Item Bank. RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, a graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning supported the retention of 33 items in the final measure. GRM calibration data was used to inform the selection of a 6-item static short form, and to program the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain computer-adaptive test (CAT). CAT simulation analyses indicated a 0.97 correlation between the CAT scores and the full item-bank. Three-week test-retest reliability was strong (r=0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain CAT and corresponding 6-item short form were developed using established rigorous measurement development standards; this is the first self-reported measure developed to evaluate caregiver strain in caregivers of individuals with TBI.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether positively or negatively phrased Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) prior to a visit with the hand surgeon affect patient perceived empathy and patient satisfaction (Patient-Reported Experience Measures [PREMs]). METHODS: Between June 2017 and July 2017, we enrolled 134 patients who presented to 3 hand surgeons at 2 outpatient offices. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: completion of negatively framed questionnaires (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS-4], and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] depression Computer Adaptive Test [CAT]) or completion of positively framed questionnaires (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire [PSEQ-2]) prior to the visit. At the end of the visit, all patients completed questionnaires on patient-perceived physician empathy and patient satisfaction. Five patients were excluded from the analysis after randomization. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant differences between groups on patient-perceived physician empathy and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the content of psychological questionnaires completed prior to the visit does not affect patient satisfaction and perceived empathy recorded after the visit. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Given the degree to which PROMs are influenced by psychosocial factors, and prior evidence that PROMs are primed by negatively framed questionnaires, it is reassuring that negatively framed PROMs did not affect PREMs, but more research is merited.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop the first item bank to measure stress resilience (SR) in clinical populations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative item development resulted in an initial pool of 131 items covering a broad theoretical SR concept. These items were tested in n = 521 patients at a psychosomatic outpatient clinic. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, as well as other state-of-the-art item analyses and item response theory were used for item evaluation and calibration of the final item bank. RESULTS: Of the initial item pool of 131 items, we excluded 64 items (54 factor loading <0.5, four residual correlations >0.3, two nondiscriminative item response curves, and four differential item functioning). The final set of 67 items indicated sufficient model fit in confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory analyses. In addition, a 10-item short form with high measurement precision (SE </= 0.32 in a theta range between -1.8 and +1.5) was derived. Both the SR item bank and the SR short form were highly correlated with an existing static legacy tool (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale). CONCLUSION: The final SR item bank and 10-item short form showed good psychometric properties. When further validated, they will be ready to be used within a framework of computer-adaptive tests for a comprehensive assessment of the stress construct.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Models from signal detection theory are commonly used to score neuropsychological test data, especially tests of recognition memory. Here we show that certain item response theory models can be formulated as signal detection theory models, thus linking two complementary but distinct methodologies. We then use the approach to evaluate the validity (construct representation) of commonly used research measures, demonstrate the impact of conditional error on neuropsychological outcomes, and evaluate measurement bias. METHOD: Signal detection-item response theory (SD-IRT) models were fitted to recognition memory data for words, faces, and objects. The sample consisted of U.S. Infantry Marines and Navy Corpsmen participating in the Marine Resiliency Study. Data comprised item responses to the Penn Face Memory Test (PFMT; N = 1,338), Penn Word Memory Test (PWMT; N = 1,331), and Visual Object Learning Test (VOLT; N = 1,249), and self-report of past head injury with loss of consciousness. RESULTS: SD-IRT models adequately fitted recognition memory item data across all modalities. Error varied systematically with ability estimates, and distributions of residuals from the regression of memory discrimination onto self-report of past head injury were positively skewed towards regions of larger measurement error. Analyses of differential item functioning revealed little evidence of systematic bias by level of education. CONCLUSIONS: SD-IRT models benefit from the measurement rigor of item response theory-which permits the modeling of item difficulty and examinee ability-and from signal detection theory-which provides an interpretive framework encompassing the experimentally validated constructs of memory discrimination and response bias. We used this approach to validate the construct representation of commonly used research measures and to demonstrate how nonoptimized item parameters can lead to erroneous conclusions when interpreting neuropsychological test data. Future work might include the development of computerized adaptive tests and integration with mixture and random-effects models.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer-adaptive testing (CAT) physical function and pain interference scores can detect early variations in postoperative outcomes following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and to determine whether age, sex, body mass index, mechanical symptoms, duration of symptoms, and the severity of chondrosis affect these scores. METHODS: Seventy-five patients who had undergone a partial meniscectomy between September 2015 and March 2016 and had both preoperative and postoperative PROMIS-CAT data for physical function, pain interference, and depression were included. Demographic, clinical, and surgical data including the presence of intraoperative chondral lesions were collected for statistical analysis to assess for factors that led to differences in PROMIS-CAT outcomes. RESULTS: Preoperatively, patients had decreased physical function and increased pain interference in excess of 1 standard deviation from the general population with mean PROMIS scores of 38.5 and 63.5, respectively. At the 6-week postoperative visit, patients had significant improvements in both physical function and pain interference with mean scores of 43.4 (P < .001, SE = 0.75) and 55.5 (P < .001, SE = 0.83). Female patients had less improvement in PROMIS physical function (P = .03) and depression (P = .02) scores postoperatively compared with male patients. Patients with high-grade articular cartilage lesions had less improvement in physical function (P = .014) and pain interference (P = .010) at 6 weeks postoperative compared with patients with low grade or no chondral lesion. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS-CAT provides responsive outcome measures to early postoperative changes in physical function and pain following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and has prognostic value in patient outcomes 6 weeks after procedure. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization of patient-reported outcome tools allows a more accurate assessment of the efficacy of treatment, which is critical to comparative effectiveness research. OBJECTIVES: The Maryland Orthopaedic Registry (MOR) was established to assess post-surgical outcomes related to patients' pain, functional status, met expectations, and satisfaction using an electronic data collection system. Secondary aims of the registry include assessment of patient expectations of treatment, activity level, and general health status. METHODS: Adult patients enrolled in this prospective observational study completed self-report measures assessing pre-operative pain, function, treatment expectations, and activity levels during the perioperative period. MOR utilizes the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R)))'computer adaptive testing for physical function, pain interference, fatigue, social satisfaction, anxiety, and depression. Perioperative data is extracted from the medical record. RESULTS: 300 patients (40% of eligible) have been enrolled into the initial cohort. Most patients (94.1%) were aged 18-65, and 57% were male. Fifty-seven percent of enrollees were White, 33% Black, and 4% Asian. PROMIS physical function and social satisfaction were both more than half a standard deviation below the population mean. Participants reported PROMIS anxiety scores that were half a standard deviation above the population mean and pain interference scores that were more than a standard deviation above the mean. Physical function scores were significantly worse among participants with lower extremity orthopaedic issues, but scores on other measures were similar between participants undergoing lower or upper extremity surgery. CONCLUSIONS: MOR provides a comprehensive assessment of patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. The utilization of electronic clinical assessment tools as well as computer adaptive testing allows for time-efficient data collection. The diverse population is a particular strength of MOR.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the performance of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity (UE) Function Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) relative to the PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT in patients seeking specialty care for upper extremity conditions. METHODS: This observational trial analyzed prospectively collected PROMIS UE and PF CAT scores from 5,202 adult patients with 10,344 outpatient clinic visits presenting to a tertiary orthopedic clinic. Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the association between initial PF and UE scores as well as the association between changes in PF and UE scores between visits. Differences in scores between populations presenting with hand conditions versus shoulder and elbow conditions were evaluated via Student t test, as were differences in scores between new and return patient visits. RESULTS: The PROMIS UE CAT scores were strongly correlated with PROMIS PF CAT scores. However, patients averaged 8 points lower scoring on UE CAT testing than on PF CAT scores. The UE CAT demonstrated a ceiling effect at a score of 56 that affected 7% of patients with a secondary ceiling at 50. Changes in PF and UE scores between visits were moderately correlated with a mean difference of less than 1 point. Patients presenting for hand conditions achieved better PF and UE scores than patients presenting for shoulder and elbow conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS UE module appears responsive to changes over time. However, the current UE CAT has a ceiling score of 56, which does not allow for improvement of scores 0.6 SD higher than the presumptive normative population mean of 50. Although a specific assessment of upper extremity function is desirable, continued refinement of the PROMIS UE CAT is required to better assess patients with higher levels of function. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.

AB  - Background: Almost 2 decades have passed since the development of the items contained in the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and during this time, daily tasks have changed to adapt to changes in technology. Methods: A cohort of 108 patients completed demographic information, the Quick DASH (both standard and technologically updated versions), and 2 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-based computerized adaptive testing questionnaires: PROMIS pain interference and upper-extremity function. To create a technologically updated Quick DASH, we substituted 3 items from the standard Quick DASH questionnaire with 3 other items related to the use of technology: (1) Text or dial with your cell phone, (2) Type on a keyboard, and (3) Use a computer mouse. Results: The technologically updated Quick DASH questionnaire had lower scores compared with the standard Quick DASH (37 vs. 33, respectively), but they had a large correlation and both had high internal consistency. The items "Text or dial with your cell phone" and "Use a computer mouse" in the updated Quick DASH questionnaire had the lowest scores. Except for affected side, the standard Quick DASH and updated Quick DASH were influenced by the same factors. PROMIS pain interference was the only independent variable affecting both questionnaire scores. Conclusions: A technologically updated Quick DASH had no advantage over the standard Quick DASH.

AB  - The patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) provides clinicians and researchers access to reliable, validated measures of physical, mental, and social well-being. The use of PROMIS can facilitate comparisons among clinical subpopulations and with the U.S. general population. We report on the first study using PROMIS measures in patients with neurofibromatosis (NF). Eighty-six adult patients (mean age = 44; 55% female; 87% white; 50% NF1, 41% NF2 and 9% schwannomatosis) completed a battery of PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CATs). Across all PROMIS instruments, mean scores for each CAT were between 48.97 and 52.60, which is within +/-0.5 SD of the U.S. general population norms. However, scores were distributed across a broad range for each PROMIS measure (+/-3 SDs). Clinically meaningful scores (defined >1 SD impairment) were observed in 20% (pain interference), 17% (pain behavior), 16% (physical function), 16% (anxiety), 16% (depression), 15% (satisfaction with social roles), 13% (fatigue), 6% (anger), and 5% (satisfaction with discretionary social activities) of the sample. All PROMIS measures were highly interrelated in bivariate analysis (P </= .001). There were no differences in PROMIS scores by disease type (NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis), or self reported learning disabilities, or compared with the US population. Scores suggest a broad continuum of symptoms and functioning in patients with NF that is not affected by NF type, as well as interrelation among the physical and psychosocial domains as measured by PROMIS. PROMIS measures may be useful in clinical practice to monitor changes in symptoms and functioning over time, as well as in clinical trials to determine patient reported changes during drug and psychosocial clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the proportion and characteristics of patients with late stage cancer that are and are not receptive to receiving rehabilitation services, and the rationale for their level of interest. DESIGN: Prospective mixed-methods study. SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center in a quaternary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with stage IIIC or IV non-small cell or extensive stage small cell lung cancer (N=311). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Telephone-acquired responses to the administration of (1) the Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM-PAC-CAT); (2) numerical rating scales for pain, dyspnea, fatigue, general emotional distress, and distress associated with functional limitations; (3) a query regarding receptivity to receipt of rehabilitation services, and (4) a query about rationale for nonreceptivity. RESULTS: Overall, 99 (31.8%) of the study's 311 participants expressed interest in receiving rehabilitation services: 38 at the time of enrollment and an additional 61 during at least 1 subsequent contact. Participants expressing interest were more likely to have a child as primary caregiver (18.18% vs 9.91%, P=.04) and a musculoskeletal comorbidity (42.4% vs 31.6%, P=.05). Function-related distress was highly associated with receptivity, as were lower AM-PAC-CAT scores. Reasons provided for lack of interest in receiving services included a perception of their limited benefit, being too busy, and prioritization below more pressing tasks/concerns. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients with late stage lung cancer are likely to be interested in receiving rehabilitation services despite high levels of disability and related distress. These findings suggest that patient misperception of the role of rehabilitation services may be a barrier to improved function and quality of life. Efforts to educate patients on the benefits of rehabilitation and to more formally integrate rehabilitation as part of comprehensive care may curb these missed opportunities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in psychometric modeling and technology allow pooling well-validated items from existing instruments into larger item banks and their deployment through methods of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Use of item response theory-based bifactor methods and integrative data analysis overcomes barriers in cross-instrument comparison. This paper presents the joint calibration of an item bank for researchers keen to investigate population variations in general psychological distress (GPD). METHODS: Multidimensional item response theory was used on existing health survey data from the Scottish Health Education Population Survey (n = 766) to calibrate an item bank consisting of pooled items from the short common mental disorder screen (GHQ-12) and the Affectometer-2 (a measure of "general happiness"). Computer simulation was used to evaluate usefulness and efficacy of its adaptive administration. RESULTS: A bifactor model capturing variation across a continuum of population distress (while controlling for artefacts due to item wording) was supported. The numbers of items for different required reliabilities in adaptive administration demonstrated promising efficacy of the proposed item bank. CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric modeling of the common dimension captured by more than one instrument offers the potential of adaptive testing for GPD using individually sequenced combinations of existing survey items. The potential for linking other item sets with alternative candidate measures of positive mental health is discussed since an optimal item bank may require even more items than these.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is a useful tool for evaluating mechanical sensitivity in patients suffering from various musculoskeletal disorders. However, no previous study has investigated PPT in the heel of patients experiencing plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS). The aim of this study was to compare PPT levels and topographic presentation of sensitivity in the heel of patients with PHPS and in healthy controls. METHODS: The reliability of PPT testing in patients with PHPS was assessed for intra- and interrater recordings. The PPT levels of 40 feet in each group were then assessed on 5 predetermined sites in the heel using a standardized measurement protocol. Patient functional status (FS) as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was employed as an external reference. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed no group differences for PPTs at all sites (P = .406). Age (P = .099) or BMI (P = .510) did not affect PPT values, although there was an effect on gender (P = .006). The analysis revealed significant differences between sites (P < .001) demonstrating a diverse topographic distribution. In the PHPS group, PPT levels at the anterior/medial, posterior/medial and central sites were significantly lower than at the posterior/lateral and anterior/lateral sites (P < .05). For the control group, PPT levels at the anterior/medial site were significantly lower than all other sites (P < .001). CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found between PPT of the PHPS patients and controls, therefore, PPT cannot be recommended as an assessment tool for these patients. The topographic distribution indicated low PPT levels at the anterior/medial area of the heel in patients with PHPS and controls. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, comparative study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) items are frequently used to assess psychological distress but no study to date has investigated the GHQ-30's potential for adaptive administration. In computerized adaptive testing (CAT) items are matched optimally to the targeted distress level of respondents instead of relying on fixed-length versions of instruments. We therefore calibrate GHQ-30 items and report a simulation study exploring the potential of this instrument for adaptive administration in a longitudinal setting. METHODS: GHQ-30 responses of 3445 participants with 2 completed assessments (baseline, 7-year follow-up) in the UK Health and Lifestyle Survey were calibrated using item response theory. Our simulation study evaluated the efficiency of CAT administration of the items, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with different estimators, item selection methods, and measurement precision criteria. RESULTS: To yield accurate distress measurements (marginal reliability at least 0.90) nearly all GHQ-30 items need to be administered to most survey respondents in general population samples. When lower accuracy is permissible (marginal reliability of 0.80), adaptive administration saves approximately 2/3 of the items. For longitudinal applications, change scores based on the complete set of GHQ-30 items correlate highly with change scores from adaptive administrations. CONCLUSIONS: The rationale for CAT-GHQ-30 is only supported when the required marginal reliability is lower than 0.9, which is most likely to be the case in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies assessing mean changes in populations. Precise measurement of psychological distress at the individual level can be achieved, but requires the deployment of all 30 items.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of an adaptive speech recognition protocol (NSRT((R))) that can be self-administered in non-clinical venues by listeners using internet-based software. DESIGN: All participants were given an audiological evaluation, including pure-tone testing, and responded to the NSRT administered in quiet and + 5 dB SNR listening conditions. The NSRT test materials are sentence-length utterances containing phonetic contrasts, primarily minimal pairs. STUDY SAMPLE: Subjects were 123 adults with normal hearing to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss (mean age = 55 years, SD = 23). RESULTS: Performance on the NSRT is strongly related to pure-tone thresholds. Linear regression analyses support the utility of the NSRT as a proxy for clinically-obtained hearing thresholds across the octave frequencies 0.5 to 8 kHz, primarily for individuals in the - 10 to 55 dB HL range. Other NSRT results are linked to analyses of phonetic errors and components of aural rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Among its numerous results, the NSRT yields quantitative predictions of frequency-specific hearing thresholds, provides insight into the phonetic errors that affect speech understanding in adults who suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, primarily in the - 10 to 55 dB HL range, and has implications for the design of individualized auditory training programs.

DESIGN: Grounded-theory based qualitative item development methods; large-scale item calibration field testing; confirmatory factor analysis; graded response model item response theory analyses; statistical linking techniques to transform scores to a PROMIS metric; and linkage with the GAD-7. Setting Five SCI Model System centers and one Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in the United States. Participants Adults with traumatic SCI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spinal Cord Injury-Quality of Life (SCI-QOL) Anxiety Item Bank RESULTS: Seven hundred sixteen individuals with traumatic SCI completed 38 items assessing anxiety, 17 of which were PROMIS items. After 13 items (including 2 PROMIS items) were removed, factor analyses confirmed unidimensionality. Item response theory analyses were used to estimate slopes and thresholds for the final 25 items (15 from PROMIS). The observed Pearson correlation between the SCI-QOL Anxiety and GAD-7 scores was 0.67. CONCLUSIONS: The SCI-QOL Anxiety item bank demonstrates excellent psychometric properties and is available as a computer adaptive test or short form for research and clinical applications. SCI-QOL Anxiety scores have been transformed to the PROMIS metric and we provide a method to link SCI-QOL Anxiety scores with those of the GAD-7.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R))) is a new, state-of-the-art assessment system for measuring patient-reported health and well-being of adults and children. It has the potential to be more valid, reliable, and responsive than existing PROMs. The items banks are designed to be self-reported and completed by children aged 8-18 years. The PROMIS items can be administered in short forms or through computerized adaptive testing. This paper describes the translation and cultural adaption of nine PROMIS item banks (151 items) for children in Dutch-Flemish. METHODS: The translation was performed by FACITtrans using standardized PROMIS methodology and approved by the PROMIS Statistical Center. The translation included four forward translations, two back-translations, three independent reviews (at least two Dutch, one Flemish), and pretesting in 24 children from the Netherlands and Flanders. RESULTS: For some items, it was necessary to have separate translations for Dutch and Flemish: physical function-mobility (three items), anger (one item), pain interference (two items), and asthma impact (one item). Challenges faced in the translation process included scarcity or overabundance of possible translations, unclear item descriptions, constructs broader/smaller in the target language, difficulties in rank ordering items, differences in unit of measurement, irrelevant items, or differences in performance of activities. By addressing these challenges, acceptable translations were obtained for all items. CONCLUSION: The Dutch-Flemish PROMIS items are linguistically equivalent to the original USA version. Short forms are now available for use, and entire item banks are ready for cross-cultural validation in the Netherlands and Flanders.

AB  - PURPOSE: To be patient-centered, assessment must extract what patients prefer to be able to do along with what they can do now so health care can specifically address the gap between current and preferred abilities. In this project, we compared patient-perceived current-preferred gaps with the assessments and interventions reported by clinicians in a rehabilitation clinic. METHODS: Sixty-two patients in outpatient physical therapy completed a computer-adaptive test version of the patient-reported Movement Ability Measure (MAM-CAT) at initial visit and discharge. The MAM-CAT calculated the gaps between the movement patients perceived that they could do "Now" and what movement ability they "Would Like" to have across six dimensions of movement: flexibility, strength, accuracy, speed, adaptability, and endurance. Physical therapists' notes regarding assessments and interventions were categorized based on these same six dimensions of movement. Frequency of agreement between the largest patient-perceived gaps and clinician-documented emphases was recorded (kappa analyses), along with MAM-CAT changes at discharge (paired t tests). RESULTS: Although patient progress was noted in both the MAM-CAT and the clinician notes (p < .05), comparison showed poor or slight agreement (kappa < .05) between the specific movement dimensions patients regarded as having the largest gaps and the dimensions on which clinicians focused. CONCLUSION: The MAM-CAT facilitated direct comparison of patients' current-preferred gaps at initiation and discharge with clinicians' emphases during episodes of care. While interventions were perceived as effective, collaboration between patients and clinicians using gap data could increase alignment between patient priorities and clinician emphases, potentially resulting in improved patient engagement and rehabilitative outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The positive emotional and sensory expectancies of cigarette smoking include improved cognitive abilities, positive affective states, and pleasurable sensorimotor sensations. This paper describes development of Positive Emotional and Sensory Expectancies of Smoking item banks that will serve to standardize the assessment of this construct among daily and nondaily cigarette smokers. METHODS: Data came from daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N =1,183) smokers who completed an online survey. To identify a unidimensional set of items, we conducted item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and differential item functioning analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of fixed-item short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive tests (CATs) to efficiently assess the construct. RESULTS: Eighteen items were included in the item banks (15 common across daily and nondaily smokers, 1 unique to daily, 2 unique to nondaily). The item banks are strongly unidimensional, highly reliable (reliability = 0.95 for both), and perform similarly across gender, age, and race/ethnicity groups. A SF common to daily and nondaily smokers consists of 6 items (reliability = 0.86). Results from simulated CATs indicated that, on average, less than 8 items are needed to assess the construct with adequate precision using the item banks. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses identified a new set of items that can assess the positive emotional and sensory expectancies of smoking in a reliable and standardized manner. Considerable efficiency in assessing this construct can be achieved by using the item bank SF, employing computer adaptive tests, or selecting subsets of items tailored to specific research or clinical purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are important for clinical research and care, yet administering and scoring the questionnaires requires considerable effort and time. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) could considerably reduce administrative obstacles and lessen survey burden for participants. OBJECTIVE: Assess the feasibility and validity of PROMIS, compared to commonly-used legacy measures for multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 133 participants with confirmed MS completed legacy surveys and PROMIS Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) for depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue and physical function. We conducted a multi-trait, multi-method analysis and verified results with confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The correlations between PROMIS and the corresponding legacy measures were large (0.67 to 0.87). The multi-trait, multi-method criteria were generally well met, providing good evidence of the validity of PROMIS measures. PROMIS surveys asked fewer questions and required substantially less time to complete than the legacy scales. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence of the construct validity of PROMIS for use with MS patients. Several aspects of the PROMIS CATs made them an important resource, including: (a) less time was required to complete them; (b) missing data was reduced; and (c) the automatic scoring referenced the general population. Our findings support the use of PROMIS in MS research and may have broader implications for clinical care, as well.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a broad set of claimant-reported items to assess behavioral health functioning relevant to the Social Security disability determination processes, and to evaluate the underlying structure of behavioral health functioning for use in development of a new functional assessment instrument. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Item pools of behavioral health functioning were developed, refined, and field tested in a sample of persons applying for Social Security disability benefits (N=1015) who reported difficulties working because of mental or both mental and physical conditions. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Social Security Administration Behavioral Health (SSA-BH) measurement instrument. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) specified that a 4-factor model (self-efficacy, mood and emotions, behavioral control, social interactions) had the optimal fit with the data and was also consistent with our hypothesized conceptual framework for characterizing behavioral health functioning. When the items within each of the 4 scales were tested in CFA, the fit statistics indicated adequate support for characterizing behavioral health as a unidimensional construct along these 4 distinct scales of function. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents a significant advance both conceptually and psychometrically in assessment methodologies for work-related behavioral health. The measurement of behavioral health functioning relevant to the context of work requires the assessment of multiple dimensions of behavioral health functioning. Specifically, we identified a 4-factor model solution that represented key domains of work-related behavioral health functioning. These results guided the development and scale formation of a new SSA-BH instrument.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) there is a high demand for short assessments. Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a promising method for efficient assessment. In this article, the efficiency of a CAT version of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, - Anhedonic Depression scale (MASQ-AD) for use in ROM was scrutinized in a simulation study. METHODS: The responses of a large sample of patients (N = 3,597) obtained through ROM were used. The psychometric evaluation showed that the items met the requirements for CAT. In the simulations, CATs with several measurement precision requirements were run on the item responses as if they had been collected adaptively. RESULTS: CATs employing only a small number of items gave results which, both in terms of depression measurement and criterion validity, were only marginally different from the results of a full MASQ-AD assessment. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that CAT improved the efficiency of the MASQ-AD questionnaire very much. The strengths and limitations of the application of CAT in ROM are discussed.

KW  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Questionnaires used by health services to identify children with psychosocial problems are often rather short. The psychometric properties of such short questionnaires are mostly less than needed for an accurate distinction between children with and without problems. We aimed to assess whether a short Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) can overcome the weaknesses of short written questionnaires when identifying children with psychosocial problems. METHOD: We used a Dutch national data set obtained from parents of children invited for a routine health examination by Preventive Child Healthcare with 205 items on behavioral and emotional problems (n = 2,041, response 84%). In a random subsample we determined which items met the requirements of an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to a sufficient degree. Using those items, item parameters necessary for a CAT were calculated and a cut-off point was defined. In the remaining subsample we determined the validity and efficiency of a Computerized Adaptive Test using simulation techniques, with current treatment status and a clinical score on the Total Problem Scale (TPS) of the Child Behavior Checklist as criteria. RESULTS: Out of 205 items available 190 sufficiently met the criteria of the underlying IRT model. For 90% of the children a score above or below cut-off point could be determined with 95% accuracy. The mean number of items needed to achieve this was 12. Sensitivity and specificity with the TPS as a criterion were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively. CONCLUSION: An IRT-based CAT is a very promising option for the identification of psychosocial problems in children, as it can lead to an efficient, yet high-quality identification. The results of our simulation study need to be replicated in a real-life administration of this CAT.

AB  - Item response theory (IRT) and related latent variable models represent modern psychometric theory, the successor to classical test theory in psychological assessment. Although IRT has become prevalent in the measurement of ability and achievement, its contributions to clinical domains have been less extensive. Applications of IRT to clinical assessment are reviewed to appraise its current and potential value. Benefits of IRT include comprehensive analyses and reduction of measurement error, creation of computer adaptive tests, meaningful scaling of latent variables, objective calibration and equating, evaluation of test and item bias, greater accuracy in the assessment of change due to therapeutic intervention, and evaluation of model and person fit. The theory may soon reinvent the manner in which tests are selected, developed, and scored. Although challenges remain to the widespread implementation of IRT, its application to clinical assessment holds great promise. Recommendations for research, test development, and clinical practice are provided.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of chronic (recurrent) otitis media with effusion (OME) on frequency weighting in the perception of speech in noise. It was hypothesized that children with a history of OME weight speech information in the mid frequency region higher than control children. DESIGN: This is a matched cohort study looking at differences in frequency weighting in 12 children with a history of OME 1 to 2 wks after placement of tympanostomy tubes compared with 21 control children. Children were tested on their ability to identify key words in sentences presented in speech-shaped noise. The frequency content of the sentences was manipulated to determine the relative importance of frequencies in the regions of 1, 2, and 4 kHz. The frequency bands selected were 798 to 1212 Hz (low band), 1575 to 2425 Hz (mid band), and 3000 to 5000 Hz (high band). Initial testing involved adaptive runs where a speech-shaped masker was held at a constant level and the level of the speech with all three bands present varied. Once a level corresponding to 85% to 90% correct was identified, novel sentences were then presented at this signal-to-noise ratio in fixed block runs, with all bands present, or with one of the three bands omitted. RESULTS: The children in the OME group achieved 85% to 90% correct at a lower signal-to-noise ratio than controls in the adaptive testing, where all three speech bands were present. Fixed block testing indicated that children with OME history gave more weight to speech frequencies in the region of 2000 Hz compared with the age-matched control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with an interpretation that the development of frequency weighting in the perception of speech can be affected by a history of OME.

AB  - False impairment is encountered when tested subjects either unintentionally or deliberately put an artificial upper limit on their force, in which case their true capacity cannot be disclosed in a straight forward measurement. The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive testing (CAT) system for directing subjects into generating greater forces than they intended. The system was tested on eleven cooperative female subjects who volunteered to take part in this study. The CAT consisted of interactive testing cycles, each containing a series of isometric tasks of differing intensities. While fulfilling these tasks, the tested subjects were asked to take care not to exceed a self-selected upper force limit (F(ssl)) that they were previously trained to memorize (order of 40% of the maximal voluntary contraction). Visual feedback, displaying the applied force exertions, was provided to the tested subjects but was modified by re-scaling the display in an un-anticipated manner. To confirm the subject's ability to remember her F(ssl), repeatability of joint memory was tested one week after the CAT. The CAT results were successful in causing ten out of the eleven tested participants to exert a higher force than they intended to. Additionally, the CAT algorithm caused a statistically significant higher force than the repeatability test. These results demonstrate the potential of CAT methods in improving the clinical evaluation of muscle strength, particularly in those cases where the subject's cooperation is not sufficient.

AB  - Physical, psychosocial, and lifestyle disturbances, along with physical and emotional symptoms, have been shown to impact the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of those dependent on renal replacement therapy. The value of HRQOL measurement as a tool to improve clinical care has been recognized by patients, clinical investigators, and health care providers. The potential importance of HRQOL assessment lies in the additional information it provides and the impact it has on the clinical decision-making process between a patient and a physician. There remain a multitude of challenges facing renal providers who wish to incorporate HRQOL measurement to improve patient care. These challenges include the clinician's understanding of the conceptual model of HRQOL, the quality of the scientific process that contributed to the current literature on HRQOL, a willingness of the clinician to incorporate HRQOL information into clinical practice, and the logistic difficulties of collecting and applying HRQOL data in a busy practice setting. Arguably, optimizing HRQOL may be the most substantial impact the health care team will have on the person with kidney failure. In order to implement HRQOL assessment at the point of care, providers may consider using computer adaptive testing and scoring algorithms using item response theory, which will allow adequate reliability for interpretation of change among individuals. Moreover, the effective assessment and interpretation of HRQOL will be aided by continued publication of norms, outcomes of randomized controlled trials, and continued experience of investigators and clinicians.

AB  - A number of issues critical to the development of computer-based neuropsychological testing systems that remain continuing challenges to their widespread use in occupational and environmental health are reviewed. Several computer-based neuropsychological testing systems have been developed over the last 20 years, and they have contributed substantially to the study of neurologic effects of a number of environmental exposures. However, many are no longer supported and do not run on contemporary personal computer operating systems. Issues that are continuing challenges for development of computer-based neuropsychological tests in environmental and occupational health are discussed: (1) some current technological trends that generally make test development more difficult; (2) lack of availability of usable speech recognition of the type required for computer-based testing systems; (3) implementing computer-based procedures and tasks that are improvements over, not just adaptations of, their manually-administered predecessors; (4) implementing tests of a wider range of memory functions than the limited range now available; (5) paying more attention to motivational influences that affect the reliability and validity of computer-based measurements; and (6) increasing the usability of and audience for computer-based systems. Partial solutions to some of these challenges are offered. The challenges posed by current technological trends are substantial and generally beyond the control of testing system developers. Widespread acceptance of the "tablet PC" and implementation of accurate small vocabulary, discrete, speaker-independent speech recognition would enable revolutionary improvements to computer-based testing systems, particularly for testing memory functions not covered in existing systems. Dynamic, adaptive procedures, particularly ones based on item-response theory (IRT) and computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) methods, will be implemented in new tests that will be more efficient, reliable, and valid than existing test procedures. These additional developments, along with implementation of innovative reporting formats, are necessary for more widespread acceptance of the testing systems.
