AB  - This study focused on test-takers<e2><80><99> psychological effects on computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The development and implementation of CAT were based on item response theory (IRT), and two-parameter logistic model was chosen for the items. The total of 268 students from a high school in Jinan took part in the English adaptive test. A structural equation model was used to examine the potential connections among a series of individual variables (computer self-efficacy, training satisfaction, test anxiety, CAT attitude and CAT performance). The findings revealed significant positive paths from computer self-efficacy and training satisfaction to CAT attitude, as well as a negative path from test anxiety to CAT performance. Furthermore, there was significant correlation between the residual variances of CAT attitude and CAT performance. Thus, it could be seen CAT might produce an unfair disadvantage for test-takers with higher test anxiety. The relevant research and implications were further discussed.

AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection). Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited. No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.

AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3-9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3-9-year-olds. The ATEM 3-9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3-9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3-9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3-9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional competencies in normative development (e.g., school readiness) and in social-emotional-learning interventions. Furthermore, it is suitable as an instrument for the differentiated assessment of (progress of) children's emotion knowledge in clinical child psychology and psychiatry.

AB  - Multistage test (MST) designs promise efficient student ability estimates, an indispensable asset for individual diagnostics in high-stakes educational assessments. In high-stakes testing, annually changing test forms are required because publicly known test items impair accurate student ability estimation, and items of bad model fit must be continually replaced to guarantee test quality. This requires a large and continually refreshed item pool as the basis for high-stakes MST. In practice, the calibration of newly developed items to feed annually changing tests is highly resource intensive. Piloting based on a representative sample of students is often not feasible, given that, for schools, participation in actual high-stakes assessments already requires considerable organizational effort. Hence, under practical constraints, the calibration of newly developed items may take place on the go in the form of a concurrent calibration in MST designs. Based on a simulation approach this paper focuses on the performance of Rasch vs. 2PL modeling in retrieving item parameters when items are for practical reasons non-optimally placed in multistage tests. Overall, the results suggest that the 2PL model performs worse in retrieving item parameters compared to the Rasch model when there is non-optimal item assembly in the MST; especially in retrieving parameters at the margins. The higher flexibility of 2PL modeling, where item discrimination is allowed to vary, seems to come at the cost of increased volatility in parameter estimation. Although the overall bias may be modest, single items can be affected by severe biases when using a 2PL model for item calibration in the context of non-optimal item placement.

AB  - Thesis (M.A. (Industrial Psychology))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. ; Selection and selection procedures play a key role in the ability of organisations to compete successfully in the complex global and local environment. South Africa is experiencing a serious artisinal and technical skill shortage. Given the unemployment issues and the quest for people to fill the skill shortage gap it is important for organizations to find possible solutions to ensure that they stay competitive and effective in the labour market. Research suggests that at least 12 500 artisans need to be produced each year from 2006 to 2010 to meet the demand for skilled workers. To address above mentioned challenge organizations have to develop strategies to assist them to select individuals with the best chance to succeed in training. Unfortunately, the solution is not simple as organisations have a multitude of influences and pressures which affect their decisions regarding selection procedures. Selection of individuals is becoming an increasingly complex science as organisations have to select a capable and representative workforce. They must thus select candidates that are most likely to benefit from what is offered educationally, meet the requirements stipulated in South Africa's Labour legislation, and will perform most successfully in the specific trade. Bad practice can lead to costly litigation. The objectives of this mini-dissertation were to assess the empirical validity of the Technical Test Battery (TTB), as ability test and the Learning Potential Computerised Adaptive Test (LPCAT) as learning potential test as predictors of academic success of first year apprentice electrician students at a South African technical college serving a mining community. The study explored the current local employment issues that affect selection for training in the technical fields. The difference between the measurement of cognitive ability and learning potential were examined and the nature of the constructs of cognitive ability and that of learning potential were discussed. In the empirical study one of the objectives was to determine whether there was a relationship between the TTB and the LPCAT as two different predictors of the academic success of first yar apprentice electrician students. The difference in the empirical (predictive) validity of the two psychometric selection instruments, if only one of the tests as opposed to if both were used in combination, were examined. Another objective was to determine if there were any differences regarding the scores on the TTB and LPCAT of students from the designated group as opposed to that of students from non-designated groups. Finally this study explored whether the TTB and LPCAT were valid predictors to be used as selection instruments for apprentice electrician students in the South African context The research method consisted of a literature review and an empirical study. The empirical validity of the two predictor tests was validated in terms of the accuracy with which the selection instruments predicted the students' future performance. This research can be categorized as descriptive quantitative research. The TTB and LPCAT scores of a sample of 89 selected apprentice electricians were compared with the number of attempts they used to pass a phase test. Data was analysed by means of descriptive statistics. Pearsons Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, t-tests, ANOVAs as well as discriminant analysis were also used to reach the research objective. Statistically significant relationships were found between the predictor and criterion variables. The results confirm that the TTB and LPCAT are indeed empirical valid tests that can be used in the selection of apprentice electricians. ; Masters

AB  - The understanding of the mechanical behavior of the unsaturated soils has been significantly enhanced due to the recent advancement of technology and modifications to the conventional testing devices. However, the implementation of the concepts of unsaturated soil has lagged, mainly due to the risks associated with the development of civil infrastructure based on practically untested theories and the limited reliable prediction methods for compacted, expansive, residual, and collapsible soils, which requires reliable and comprehensive experimental data. Moreover, the tests on unsaturated soils are enormously time consuming and often exorbitantly expensive, which further hinders the use of unsaturated soil mechanics in practical applications. Additionally, the liquefaction of cohesionless soils has predominantly been considered only for saturated soils. However, the soils with high degree of saturation, yet partially saturated, which are mostly near the ground surface and have low overburden pressure, may liquefy during earthquakes. Since plenty of unsaturated cohesionless soils are present near high seismic activity zones, the susceptibility of these soils to liquefy needs to be studied. Addressing these problems has been the main objective of the present dissertation research. The characteristics of compacted soils were studied by performing an elaborate series of suction-controlled monotonic triaxial tests on compacted silty soil specimens following the hydrostatic compression (HC) and the conventional triaxial compression (CTC) stress paths at varying net mean stresses and matric suction levels. The multistage triaxial tests were performed on the silty soil specimens at varying suction levels using a new approach to address the issues related to soil variability and to significantly reduce the testing time while maintaining the reliability of the test results. The Barcelona Basic Model (BBM) framework was used to reproduce experimental test results both from suction-controlled single-stage and multistage triaxial tests. Hence the BBM was indirectly used to demonstrate the utility of multistage triaxial tests in replicating test results or predictions similar to single-stage triaxial testing. The influence of suction, unit weight, and wetting and drying of the compacted specimens of silty soil on the resilient modulus was also studied by performing a comprehensive series of suction-controlled repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests over a wide range of suction to address the issue of repeatability of RLT tests. In this dissertation research, the tendency of the soil in unsaturated condition to liquefy was studied by performing cyclic triaxial tests on suction-equilibrated silty sand specimens. A series of cyclic triaxial tests were performed in undrained conditions at varying suction states and cyclic stress ratios to assess the liquefaction potential of the soil at varying relative densities and matric suction levels. The findings from this dissertation research would assist in the development of future constitutive models for predicting the response of dilatant soils in unsaturated conditions subjected to monotonic and dynamic loading.

AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally-developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adaptive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and a classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators<e2><80><99> responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators<e2><80><99> experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback be solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n=248; aged 7-17years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. RESULTS: Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common mental disorders among children and adolescents, and it may seriously affect their growth, daily life, and learning. Self-report scales have been used for diagnosis, which require lengthy testing and personnel. Methods: A total of 1,241 adolescents were recruited from 16 junior- and senior-high schools in China. The initial item bank was selected from classical SAD scales according to the DSM-5. First, the optimal model was selected using item response theory (IRT) according to data fit. Then, per the IRT analysis, items that did not meet the psychometric requirements were deleted (e.g., discriminating values < 0.2). Consequently, a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for SAD was formed (CAT-SAD). Results: An average of 17 items per participant was required to achieve and maintain a 0.3 standard error of measurement in the SAD severity estimate. The estimated correlation of the CAT-SAD with the total 68-item test score was 0.955. CAT-SAD scores were strongly related to the probability of a SAD diagnosis with the Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale<e2><80><94>Child and Adolescent Version. Therefore, SAD could be accurately predicted by the CAT-SAD. Conclusions: Exploratory factor analyses revealed that SAD was unidimensional. The CAT-SAD, which has good reliability and validity and high sensitivity and specificity, provides an efficient test for adolescents with SAD as compared to standard paper-and-pencil tests. It can be used to diagnose varying degrees of SAD quickly and reliably and ease the burden on adolescents. Potential applications for inexpensive, efficient, and accurate screening of SAD are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - PURPOSE: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for depression in the general adult population. Although screening questionnaires for depression and anxiety exist in primary care settings, electronic health tools such as computerized adaptive tests based on item response theory can advance screening practices. This study evaluated the validity of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) for screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) and assessing MDD and anxiety severity among adult primary care patients. METHODS: We approached 402 English-speaking adults for participation from a primary care clinic, of whom 271 adults (71% female, 65% black) participated. Participants completed modules from the CAT-MH (Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD, CAT-Depression Inventory, CAT-Anxiety Inventory); brief paper questionnaires (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]); and a reference-standard interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) Diagnoses. RESULTS: On the basis of the interview, 31 participants met criteria for MDD and 29 met criteria for GAD. The diagnostic accuracy of the Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD (area under curve [AUC] = 0.85) was similar to that of the PHQ-9 (AUC = 0.84) and higher than that of the PHQ-2 (AUC = 0.76) for MDD screening. Using the interview as the reference standard, the accuracy of the CAT-Anxiety Inventory (AUC = 0.93) was similar to that of the GAD-7 (AUC = 0.97) for assessing anxiety severity. The patient-preferred screening method was assessment via tablet/computer with audio. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized adaptive testing could be a valid and efficient patient-centered screening strategy for depression and anxiety screening in primary care settings.

AB  - Objective: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk assessments need to be validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of a highly efficient computerized adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among SGMY. Methods: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n = 1,073) and at their follow-up visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity were performed. Results: Younger, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual (e.g., bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender nonconforming or nongender binary (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior wave. Conclusions: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for the identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual, and gender nonconforming or nongender binary. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Public Health Statement<e2><80><94>Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) are at disproportionate risk for suicidal ideation, attempts, and death by suicide. This study demonstrated that among SGMY a very brief CAT was more predictive of future suicidality than self-report of prior suicidality. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using this tool could allow for efficient identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide.

AB  - A sensitivity analysis in an observational study determines the magnitude of bias from nonrandom treatment assignment that would need to be present to alter the qualitative conclusions of a na<c3><af>ve analysis that presumes all biases were removed by matching or by other analytic adjustments. The power of a sensitivity analysis and the design sensitivity anticipate the outcome of a sensitivity analysis under an assumed model for the generation of the data. It is known that the power of a sensitivity analysis is affected by the choice of test statistic, and, in particular, that a statistic with good Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment, such as Wilcoxon<e2><80><99>s signed rank statistic, may have low power in a sensitivity analysis and low design sensitivity when compared to other statistics. For instance, for an additive treatment effect and errors that are Normal or logistic or t-distributed with 3 degrees of freedom, Brown<e2><80><99>s combined quantile average test has Pitman efficiency close to that of Wilcoxon<e2><80><99>s test but has higher power in a sensitivity analysis, while a version of Noether<e2><80><99>s test has poor Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment but much higher design sensitivity so it is vastly more powerful than Wilcoxon<e2><80><99>s statistic in a sensitivity analysis if the sample size is sufficiently large. A new exact distribution-free test is proposed that rejects if either Brown<e2><80><99>s test or Noether<e2><80><99>s test rejects after adjusting the two critical values so the overall level of the combined test remains at <ce><b1>, conventionally <ce><b1> = 0.05. In every sampling situation, the design sensitivity of the adaptive test equals the larger of the two design sensitivities of the component tests. The adaptive test exhibits good power in sensitivity analyses asymptotically and in simulations. In one sampling situation<e2><80><94>Normal errors and an additive effect that is three-quarters of the standard deviation with 500 matched pairs<e2><80><94>the power of Wilcoxon<e2><80><99>s test in a sensitivity analysis was 2% and the power of the adaptive test was 87%. A study of treatments for ovarian cancer in the Medicare population is discussed in detail.

AB  - After the stability and sensitivity of FLOR were investigated, the application of it in the CAT environment had become the main concern. The present studies found that both the test length and the number of exposed items affect the final value of FLOR. In the fixed length CAT, the FLOR has a much stronger sensitivity than lz and CUSUM in detecting item pre-knowledge. The sensitivity of FLOR in the fixed length CAT was the same as that in the fixed length fixed items test. If the test length could vary, the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT would be slightly weakened. The Adjusted FLOR index could increase the sensitivity. Concerning about the effect of ability on the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT, it was found that the abilities of the test takers in CAT did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR and Adjusted FLOR. ; Item response theory is a modern test theory. It focuses on the performance of each item. Under this framework, the performance of test takers on a test item can be predicted by a set of abilities. The relationship between the test takers' item performances and the set of abilities underlying item performances can be described by a monotonically increasing function called an item characteristic curve. Due to various personal reasons, the performances of the test takers may depart from the response patterns predicted by the underlying test model. In order to calculate the extent of departure of these aberrant response patterns, a number of methods have been developed under the theme "person-fit statistics". The degree of aberration is calculated as an index called person-fit index. Inside the computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test takers with different abilities will answer different numbers of questions and the difficulties of the items administered to them are usually clustered at the abilities of the test takers. Due to this reason, the application of person-fit indices in the computerized adaptive testing environment to measure misfit is difficult. ; The present study also found that FLOR has a much ...

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the Computerized Adaptive Test to measure anxiety (A-CAT), a patient-reported outcome questionnaire that uses computerized adaptive testing to measure anxiety. METHODS: The A-CAT builds on an item bank of 50 items that has been built using conventional item analyses and item response theory analyses. The A-CAT was administered on Personal Digital Assistants to n=357 patients diagnosed and treated at the department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Charite Berlin, Germany. For validation purposes, two subgroups of patients (n=110 and 125) answered the A-CAT along with established anxiety and depression questionnaires. RESULTS: The A-CAT was fast to complete (on average in 2 min, 38 s) and a precise item response theory based CAT score (reliability>.9) could be estimated after 4-41 items. On average, the CAT displayed 6 items (SD=4.2). Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures. CONCLUSIONS: The German A-CAT is an efficient, reliable, and valid tool for assessing anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders and other conditions with significant potential for initial assessment and long-term treatment monitoring. Future research directions are to explore content balancing of the item selection algorithm of the CAT, to norm the tool to a healthy sample, and to develop practical cutoff scores.

AB  - The transonic facility of DLR G<c3><b6>ttingen (TWG) has been modernised with respect to an improved flow quality and flow simulation, as well as to the logistics of exchangeable test sections, operational reliability and productivity. It is presently equipped with a Laval nozzle for supersonic flow measurements, a perforated test section (6% open, 60 degree slanted holes) for transonic measurements, and a two-dimensional adaptive test section for subsonic measurements. The latter can perform two-dimensinal adaptive tests on wing profiles, using the Cauchy integral formula for wall adaptation, as well as two-dimensional wall adaptation for three-dimensional models, utilising the Wedemeyer/Lamarche procedure, also known as the VKI method. For both cases, it is shown that the wall adaptation was successful. The 3D force results compare quite well to test results from the perforated test section, as well as to nominally interference-free results. The pressure distribution from the wing profile tests compare quite well to theoretical calculations. In the course of windtunnel modernisation, the transonic facility of DLR Goettingen has been equipped with the new software system DeAsfor data acquisition and control of experimental facilities. In this environment the wall adaptation programs had to be implemented. Before adjusting the computed wall shape, it has to be controlled in the loop for sufficient accuracy and tolerable bending stresses. A simplified finite element method - also taking into account the pressure loads at the wall - is used for this purpose. The simplified approach has been checked against more detailed computations using ANSYS and NASTRAN.

AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback<e2><80><93>Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Follow-up of stroke survivors is important to objectify activity limitations and/or participations restrictions. Responsive measurement tools are needed with a low burden for professional and patient. AIM: To examine the concurrent validity, floor and ceiling effects and responsiveness of both domains of the Late-Life Function and Disability Index Computerized Adaptive Test (LLFDI-CAT) in first-ever stroke survivors discharged to their home setting. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Community. POPULATION: First ever stroke survivors. METHODS: Participants were visited within three weeks after discharge and six months later. Stroke Impact Scale (SIS 3.0) and Five-Meter Walk Test (5MWT) outcomes were used to investigate concurrent validity of both domains, activity limitations, and participation restriction, of the LLFDI-CAT. Scores at three weeks and six months were used to examine floor and ceiling effects and change scores were used for responsiveness. Responsiveness was assessed using predefined hypotheses. Hypotheses regarding the correlations with change scores of related measures, unrelated measures, and differences between groups were formulated. RESULTS: The study included 105 participants. Concurrent validity (R) of the LLFDI-CAT activity limitations domain compared with the physical function domain of the SIS 3.0 and with the 5MWT was 0.79 and -0.46 respectively. R of the LLFDI-CAT participation restriction domain compared with the participation domain of the S1S 3.0 and with the 5MWT was 0.79 and -0.41 respectively. A ceiling effect (15%) for the participation restriction domain was found at six months. Both domains, activity limitations and participation restrictions, of the LLFDI-CAT, scored well on responsiveness: 100% (12/12) and 91% ( I 2/11) respectively of the predefined hypotheses were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The LLFDI-CAT seems to be a valid instrument and both domains are able to detect change over time. Therefore, the LLFD-CAT is a promising tool to use both in practice and in ...

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Measure quality of life (QoL) outcomes using a novel computerised adaptive test in a clinical setting, and determine the social and demographic factors associated with specific QoL domains in patients with glaucoma. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study between July 2020 and April 2021. PARTICIPANTS: English-speaking adults presenting to glaucoma clinic. Patients with cognitive impairment on a six-item cognitive impairment screen or with intraocular surgery within 90 days prior to presentation were excluded. RESULTS: Of 206 patients surveyed, mean age was 64.8 years (SD 15.2), 122 (56.7%) were female and 159 (74.7%) were white. On multivariable regression, visual acuity was associated with greater activity limitation (beta=-2.8 points, 95% CI -3.8 to -1.8, p<0.001) and worse mobility (beta=-2.1 points, 95% CI -3.2 to -0.9, p<0.001), while poorer visual field (VF) mean deviation was associated with lower scores on the emotional well-being domain (beta=-2.4 points, 95% CI -4.6 to -0.3, p=0.03). Glaucoma suspects and those with early VF defects had higher QoL scores than those with severe glaucoma in the following domains: activity limitation (88.5+/-14.6 vs 74.3+/-21.9, respectively, p<0.001), mobility (91.0+/-12.5 vs 80.0+/-25.3, respectively, p=0.005) and concerns domains (82.2+/-13.9 vs 72.5 5+/-18.9, respectively, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a busy glaucoma clinic where QoL was measured with online adaptive tests for glaucoma, we found that several demographic and clinical variables are associated with lower domain scores, suggesting that patients with predisposing demographic and clinical factors are at a higher risk of worse QoL.

In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

AB  - Studies have shown that test anxiety has become more prevalent since the adoption of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 and that test anxiety negatively affects student achievement. Early research viewed test anxiety as being a unidimensional construct; however, recent research has purported that test anxiety is a multidimensional construct. Consequently, test anxiety being viewed as multidimensional has changed how test anxiety is measured as evidenced by the development of multidimensional test anxiety measurement scales. Literature indicates that there is a gap in the study of K-12 test anxiety and response time data on assessments. A nonexperimental correlational research design was used for this study. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between multidimensional test anxiety measures and the response time of students taking a computerized adaptive math assessment, the "Measures of Academic Progress"<c2><ae> (MAP<c2><ae>) by the Northwest Evaluation Association<e2><84><a2> (NWEA<e2><84><a2>), while controlling for gender. Participants for the study were 215 seventh grade math students at a school in the West. The test anxiety of participants was measured using the Children's Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS). The response time data was captured by the NWEA<e2><84><a2> MAP<c2><ae> math tests. Spearman correlations were used to examine the relationship between test anxiety and response time. No statistically significant relationships were found. Recommendations for future research are to examine relationships between test anxiety and RTE using different normative thresholds (NT) and utilizing other multidimensional test anxiety scales as they become commercially available.

AB  - Scholarship regarding adolescent resilience has typically defined resilience as the absence of negative outcomes rather than the existence of positive outcomes. This study drew on the challenge model of resilience, which anticipates a curvilinear relationship between stress exposure and adaptive functioning, to test whether adolescents reporting moderate levels of stress exposure were more likely to evidence prosocial behavior than youth exposed to more or less stress. Using data from approximately 13,000 adolescents, we tested three analytic models and investigated hypothesized moderation by coping, social resources, and markers of adolescent status. Our results did not align with the challenge model. Instead, we found that stress exposure was differentially associated with measures of prosocial behavior, that social resources supported volunteering but impeded helping a peer in some instances, and that markers of historically marginalized status were more predictive of stopping peer harassment than volunteering. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Measuring the implementation fidelity (IF) or integrity of interventions is crucial, otherwise a positive or negative outcome cannot be interpreted. Direct and indirect methods of IF measurement tend to over-emphasize teacher behaviour. This paper focuses on IF measured by student behaviour collected through computers. Attainment was measured by the STAR test of maths (a computerized item-banked adaptive norm-referenced test). Implementation quality (IF) was measured by Accelerated Maths (AM) (an instruction-free personalized practice and progress-monitoring system in mastery of mathematics skills). Attainment data was gathered in the UK on 20,103 students in 148 schools, and of these implementation data on n =<c2><a0>6,285. Only a small percentage of pupils scored on five AM implementation indices at or above the levels recommended. Correlations between attainment and implementation indices were modest, but high implementation was positively correlated with high attainment. Socio-economic status did not appear to affect implementation or attainment. Implementation quality of AM is clearly a problem in the UK, and needs improvement. However, overall students still scored above average on attainment.

AB  - The interactionist model (IM) of human development (R. D. Conger & M. B. Donellan, 2007) proposes that the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and human development involves a dynamic interplay that includes both social causation (SES influences human development) and social selection (individual characteristics affect SES). Using a multigenerational data set involving 271 families, the current study finds empirical support for the IM. Adolescent personality characteristics indicative of social competence, goal-setting, hard work, and emotional stability predicted later SES, parenting, and family characteristics that were related to the positive development of a third-generation child. Processes of both social selection and social causation appear to account for the association between SES and dimensions of human development indicative of healthy functioning across multiple generations.

No statistically significant differences were found among the test types for either estimated ability or posttest anxiety.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that, when administered a self-adapted test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a self-adapted test--lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT)--can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted self-adapted test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only in the region of their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class. The results show that while the RS-AT effectively controlled the standard errors of proficiency estimation, examinees receiving an RS-AT did not show higher mean proficiency or lower posttest state anxiety than examinees receiving a CAT.

AB  - This study examined college students' motivational tendencies as predictors of academic outcomes and tested how students' goal orientations and academic delay of gratification mediated these associations. The study used data, previously analyzed in 1999, on academic delay of gratification, personal achievement goal orientations, self-efficacy, test anxiety, demographics, time dedicated to studying, and college grade point average. The results show that students' task goal orientation and academic delay of gratification mediate the relationship between self-efficacy and the time students dedicate to study. These results are considered under the umbrella of Zimmerman's cyclical model of self-regulation, which posits that learners engage in sustaining cognition, behavior, and emotions to pursue academic goals and intentions. The findings are also consistent with Mischel's self-regulatory approach, which assumes that effective delay of gratification is a function of motivation and voluntary postponement of immediate gratification in order to pursue later outcomes. The results demonstrate that students who have high self-efficacy are engaging in academic tasks for the sake of learning and mastering work, delay gratification and persist longer in goal directed study time. Implications for education and future research are discussed. Appended are: sample items from the Academic Volitional Strategy Scales and from the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey, Test Anxiety, Self-Efficacy and Reliability Cronbach Alphas.

AB  - The differences in types of information-processing skills developed by different instructional backgrounds affect, negatively or positively, the learning of further advanced instructional materials. If prior and subsequent instructional methods are different, a proactive inhibition effect produces low achievement scores on a post test. This poses a serious problem for routing of students to an instructional level on the sole basis of performance on a diagnostic adaptive test and makes it essential to determine what information-processing strategy was used and consider this knowledge simultaneously. Response time often provides supplementary information which differentiates among individuals showing identical quality of performance. A model that reflects this kind of information, obtainable from response time scores, is formulated in a similar manner to latent trait theory. This model is useful in identifying discriminating items that are sensitive to differences in instructional method. It also is helpful in identifying an individual's instructional background to a certain extent. (Author/CTM)

This paper proposes a kind of eliminate redundancy pattern method, so that this MRMR (Max-Relevance Min-Redundancy) algorithm which can provide test cost reduction without increasing the defect level obviously. Experiment results demonstrate that the valid test patterns have higher test quality, which can reduce the test time and test cost of the faulty circuit. The algorithm is completely software-based and does not require any additional hardware overhead and is directly compatible with traditional integrated circuit testing process.

AB  - Most recent e-learning platforms include testing modules and Computer Based Assessment (CBA) is currently one of the most pressing issues in Learning Management Systems (LMS). Traditional testing techniques aren't fully adequate to examination administration in higher education contexts, as they generally require choosing the answer just in a narrow set of options. Adaptive testing permits an evaluation more suitable for the examinee but it is affected by limits related to the uniformity of the exams, to the range/width of the subjects and to the large amount of items to be inserted in the question databases. e-Xamina is a prototype of assessment platform aimed at combining the features of these two main kinds of CBA. e-Xamina model suggests a new performance based exam pattern and a score criterion based on standard examination practice. Finally, e-Xamina multi-user feature allows the teachers to cooperate in managing course database, with many different levels of competence and rights.

The change of CMLAS is applied as an indicator for ICT infused mathematics intervention effect. A computerized dynamic assessment model which combines mathematics computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) and a two-phase ICT infused intervention is implemented in this study. The first intervention phase uses a spatial game to modify student's mathematics learning approach. The second intervention phase focuses on fostering the slow learner's automaticity of numerical operation. The results suggest that the assessment of goal orientation change is a good predictor for ICT infused mathematics intervention effect.

AB  - The continuing miniaturization of LSI dimension is causing the increase of process-related variations which significantly affects not only its design turn around time but also its manufacturing yield. Statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) is expected as a promising way to estimate the performance of circuits more accurately considering delay variations. However, LSIs designed using SSTA may have higher probability of parametric faults than the ones designed with deterministic timing analysis. In order to test these parametric faults, effective extraction techniques of critical paths are needed. In this paper, we discuss a general trend between the delay margin of LSIs designed by SSTA and their parametric fault ratio. Then we propose an adaptive test flow for parametric faults using statistical static timing information, and a concept of parametric fault coverage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - Computer programming learning is an important and challenging process for novice students. Previous approaches often address the learning problem of creating algorithm and familiarizing syntax. However, students still need the extra programming knowledge of selecting proper data structure to implement the program. In this paper, the scaffolding approach is used to assist students in comprehending the problem-solving strategy to find suitable data structure. In the experiment, 55 students participated in the two groups' pretest and posttest evaluation. The experimental results showed that the experimental group achieves higher learning achievement than the control group. The results suggest that computer-assisted scaffolding can be exploited as effective and motivational learning guidance for students.

AB  - A particularly good software testing strategy is to achieve the underlying testing goal while solving the problems of tradeoffs between testing effectiveness and efficiency. To improve the fault detection effectiveness of software testing, the principle of feedback control theory was adopted, which motivated the proposal of dynamic random testing (DRT). The main idea behind DRT is using the testing results to guide the test case selection to increase the selection probabilities of the subdomains with higher fault detection rates. Previous works show that DRT strategy can achieve better effectiveness than random testing strategy and random partition testing strategy, and has significantly lower computational costs than adaptive testing strategy. However, the essential factors that affect the performance of DRT, i.e., adjusting parameters, initial profile, and test case classification have not been thoroughly investigated. Besides, some experimental assumptions are inconsistent with real scenarios. Therefore, this paper gives a series of investigations on DRT with a set of practical subject programs. More specifically, the effectiveness and efficiency of DRT are presented, and the extended experiments on DRT with relevant factors are conducted. The results indicate that the effectiveness of DRT is robust to different initial profiles and affected noticeably by the adjusting parameter settings and test case classification methods.

AB  - The expanded role of test demands a significant change in mind-set of nearly every engineer involved in the screening of semiconductor products. The issues to consider range from DFT and ATE requirements, to the design and optimization of test patterns, to the physical and statistical relationships of different tests, and finally, to the economics of reducing test time and cost. The identification of outliers to isolate latent defects will likely increase the role of statistical testing in present and future technologies. An emerging opportunity is to use statistical analysis of parametric measurements at multiple test corners to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of testing and reliability defect stressing. In this article, we propose a "statistical testing" framework that combines testing, analysis, and optimization to identify latent-defect signatures. We discuss the required characteristics of statistical testing to isolate the embedded-outlier population; test conditions and test application support for the statistical-testing framework; and the data modeling for identifying the outliers.

AB  - Test cost is becoming increasingly significant percentage of COB (Cost of Build) in current SoCs (System-on-a-Chip). This is even critical in low cost markets like consumer devices. This session covers test cost reduction strategy that can be adopted on a typical semiconductor product, during design and post-silicon phases. Test cost reduction during design phase includes, adoption of right DFT (Design-For-Test) architectures and technologies, target ATE (Automated Test Equipment) selection and design for compliance for targeted ATE. DFT architectural aspects that can impact test cost reduction are multi-site configuration, concurrent tests, scan compression technology, IDDQ strategy, memory test and repair solution. Critical challenges of these techniques and design impact like gate count overhead, robust power grid design, route-ability and diagnose-ability would be covered. The impact of these techniques is quantified at SOC level, from test cost point of view. Post-silicon test cost reduction techniques include approaches like vector elimination based on statistical analysis of COF (Continue-on-Fail) data and program trimming techniques to optimize test program. Vector elimination directly affects DPPM (Defective Parts Per Million) requirements and hence needs to be handled carefully. Another powerful post-silicon technique that can reduce test time and improve yield is adaptive test. Adaptive tests include techniques like a) on-line statistical sampling, which can selectively skip tests that statistically never fail b) outlier detection and extraction, which helps to eliminate expensive reliability tests like burn-in. Adaptive tests can also be used to improve the yield by off-setting tester parameters as per site2site variations and using fab PCM (Process Control Monitor) data to optimize the device for performance and power through appropriate trimming. As the design community is pushing for higher concurrent and higher compression goals, test power is becoming a major consideration. While EDA solutions like low power ATPG is prevalent in industry, comprehensive test power architecture advisor, which can guide designer to architect DFT solutions which is optimal from both test time and test power is the need of the industry. Current state of solution on this problem is covered in this session.

AB  - Many applications are being developed to leverage the popularity of mobile opportunistic networks. However, building adaptive testbeds can be costly and challenging. This challenge motivates the need for effective opportunistic network simulators to provide a variety of opportunistic environment setups, and evaluate proposed applications and protocols with a comprehensive set of metrics. This paper presents SAROS, a simulator of opportunistic networking environments with a variety of interest distributions, power consumption distributions, imported real traces, and social network integration. The simulator provides a wide variety of evaluation metrics that are not offered by comparable simulators. Finally, SAROS also implements several opportunistic forwarding algorithms ranging from social-oblivious algorithms to interest and power-aware social-based algorithms.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) selects each item to match with an examinee's ability level during the test. In contrast, multistage adaptive testing (MST) administers a group of items instead of each individual item adaptively. A hybrid design combines CAT and MST borrowing strengths from both testing modes. However, existing research studies indicate that there is lack of knowledge on hybrid designs in passage-based adaptive testing, including situations where misrouting occurs. Misrouting refers to when examinees get routed to paths that don't match with their true ability levels. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the proposed hybrid designs (HMCAT designs) with respect to ability estimation accuracy under different MST configurations and their performance when misrouting occurs.The HMCAT designs under passage-based adaptive testing control test adaptability at both passage/stimulus level and item level. Four proposed HMCAT designs differ by implementing the item level CAT at different stages of the MST. Specifically, among all four designs, the two most extreme designs are the one implementing CAT across all stages (CC) and the one not implementing CAT across any stage (PP). The two hybrid designs include implementing CAT only in the routing stage (CP) and implementing CAT only in the last stage (PC). The hybrid designs' performance compared to that of the CC design and the PP design when interacting with different MST configurations and when misrouting occurs are the two main research questions of the study. The three-phase simulation analysis indicates that (1) the PC design achieves more accurate final ability estimation results under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (2) although the CP design fails to perform effectively when misrouting occurs under the three-stage MST configuration, it is still able to achieve accurate final ability estimation results under both two-stage MST configurations; (3) the CC design and the PP design achieve similar and the most accurate final ability estimation results under all four MST configurations; (4) the PC design reaches similar accuracy as the CC design and the PP design under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (5) the CP design reaches a similar accuracy level as the CC design and the PP design under both two-stage MST configurations; (6) the CP design is affected the most when misrouting occurs in the three-stage MST configuration, whereas the other three HMCAT designs are not affected. In general, findings from simulation analyses suggest that the HMCAT designs are effective enough to use in passage/stimulus-based adaptive tests with appropriate MST configurations. They also contain advantages such as greater flexibility with respect to content balancing, test security and control on item administration. However, it is important to understand that the performance of HMCAT designs can heavily depend on the MST configuration, the item pool characteristics, the test design and components in the test administration algorithm, such as content balancing strategies. Results from the current study provide implications for practitioners on how to decide on an appropriate HMCAT design under real testing contexts and how to evaluate and maintain the selected HMCAT design to effectively implement the design in practice.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been largely limited to investigating traits with a single time measurement. However, many prospective cohort studies and electronic health record (EHR)-based cohorts with GWAS data have collected traits with repeated measurements across follow-up time. Effectively utilizing the information embedded in the time trajectory of measurements could greatly increase the power of association testing. Local association signal patterns across the whole genome are usually variable, complicated and unpredictable, which underscores the need for a data adaptive test capable of maintaining high statistical power across different genetic architecture and association signal patterns. Furthermore, complex diseases are usually affected by multiple variants in a gene and multiple genes in a biological pathway. In addition, traditional single SNP-based association testing has very limited statistical power for variants of low to rare minor allele frequency (MAF < 5% or 1%). A SNP-set-based association test, e.g., based on genes or pathways, could boost the statistical power by aggregating individual weak to moderate association signals across a region of interest. In this dissertation, I have developed such powerful data-adaptive tests that address these analytical challenges facing association testing between longitudinal traits and rare or common variants. I implemented extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed tests, and illustrated their applications in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. I also produced a software package with documentation to implement the proposed tests in high performance computing platform. In conclusion, this dissertation paves a new path in extending the traditional association tests to longitudinal traits, helps identify novel genes and explain the missing heritability in human complex diseases.

AB  - Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) purports to combine the strengths of both CAT and cognitive diagnosis. Cognitive diagnosis models aim at classifying examinees into the correct mastery profile group so as to pinpoint the strengths and weakness of each examinee whereas CAT algorithms choose items to determine those strengths and weakness as efficiently as possible. Most of the existing CD-CAT item selection algorithms are evaluated when test length is relatively long whereas several applications of CD-CAT, such as in interim assessment, require an item selection algorithm that is able to accurately recover examinees' mastery profile with short test length. In this article, we introduce the mutual information item selection method in the context of CD-CAT and then provide a computationally easier formula to make the method more amenable in real time. Mutual information is then evaluated against common item selection methods, such as Kullback-Leibler information, posterior weighted Kullback-Leibler information, and Shannon entropy. Based on our simulations, mutual information consistently results in nearly the highest attribute and pattern recovery rate in more than half of the conditions. We conclude by discussing how the number of attributes, Q-matrix structure, correlations among the attributes, and item quality affect estimation accuracy.

AB  - Biomarker-directed targeted designs have been developed in recent years for pharmaceutical development for patient subpopulation with specific disease etiology. Multistage testing and adaption are desired for targeted designs to manage the risk of study population deviation, to conduct interim analysis and to make decisions on stochastic curtailment. We propose a multistage adaptive design for targeted trials that allows flexibility in multistage testing, stochastic curtailment decision-making, biomarker performance monitoring and biomarker performance-based sample size adaption. The design is based on the theorem that the sequence of test statistics from multistage testings asymptotically satisfies Brownian motion in different targeted trial settings. The theorem is proven for both continuous and binary endpoints. The simulation analysis has indicated that targeted multistage designs perform better than its untargeted counterpart in trial efficiency, effective information accumulation and stochastic curtailment decision-making by selecting targeted patients. However, this study has shown that biomarker performance influences heterogeneity of targeted study population and consequently affects planning and multistage testing of a targeted trial. The impact of biomarker performance has been extensively examined with regard to study efficiency, actual statistical power, type-I error, information accrument, and stochastic curtailment decision-making. To cope with the limited information of biomarker performance at study planning, we propose the biomarker performance-based sample size adaption for targeted trials for continuous and binary endpoints, respectively. The adaptive method can update actual biomarker performance at interim analysis and re-estimate sample size to achieve planned statistical power while preserving type-I error rate. In summary, the multistage adaptive design improves targeted trials by providing great flexibility in multistage testing, early stopping, biomarker performance monitoring and biomarker performance-based sample size adaption.

AB  - School districts across the country are meeting the accountability challenges set forth by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) federal legislation, as well as challenges put forth at their state and local levels. Districts' accountability efforts have often brought them to contract with outside organizations offering standardized assessments for progress monitoring of students in intervention programs, and for on-going local assessments for program evaluation and planning. One such organization, Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), has developed several computer-based testing products to assist districts in their accountability and teaching/learning efforts. Their flagship product, Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), is a computerized-adaptive test (CAT), and is typically delivered on-line to districts. Using Item Response Theory (IRT) selection algorithms, test questions are selected based on students' answers throughout the test experience. Students are presented with their first question (item) based on a predetermined value of their ability from previous testing and what is known about the item (Baker, 2001). Once they respond to the item, the software calibrates a temporary achievement level for that student, and selects their next question based on their estimated competency. Use of such powerful test assembly methods can enable a test to derive precise performance information about each student. Tests are assembled on demand, and results are immediately available to instructors and district personnel. While precise information at a broader range of abilities is possible using such test assembly methods, item selection processes typically present items in a randomized order to maximize item bank usage, test security, and measurement properties. Little research has been done on item order with young test takers in the elementary grades, and the literature on item order with regard to computerized adaptive testing is silent. Of particular interest was whether a content-clustered version of a computerized adaptive test would result in stronger performance with young test takers, and whether the efficient testing processes already available via on-line testing could be improved. Data was reviewed in light of demographic sub-groups, including gender, ethnicity, and grade level. The current study delivered both the standard version of a computerized adaptive test, MAP, along with a modified version, to a test population of 6589 students in a large southern U.S. school district of second, third, fourth and fifth graders. Using a double-blind selection process, half of the students received the standard MAP, and half received the modified version, which clustered items by goal strand across the five sub-tests of the assessment. The study indicated that overall scores on MAP are not increased by content clustering, nor are there significant time gains on the overall test, for all students as a whole. However, results do indicate areas of significance with regard to ethnic sub-group differences. Overall test performance was stronger for African Americans on the modified version, while overall test duration was reduced for the three major ethnic sub-groups, particularly Hispanics. Boys improved their scores overall on the modified version, and gender differences on goal strands were present, which may indicate that certain goal strands scores increase under clustered conditions.

It was found that CAT could recover from misfit-as-correct-responses for low ability simulees given a sufficient number of items.

AB  - The initiation of wellbore failure and subsequent production of sand to the surface in petroleum reservoirs has often been associated with an increase in water cut.<c2><a0> Published field-level studies and experimental results do not provide a definite correlation between these two events - sand production and water breakthrough.<c2><a0> The experimental work described in this thesis aims to quantify the changes in the strength of weakly cemented and unconsolidated sand samples due to changes in fluid saturations.<c2><a0> This thesis addresses the reasons for the observed strength differences using unconsolidated and weakly cemented samples made of pure quartz, and different pore fluids (air, water and oil). Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) tests, Thick Wall Cylinder (TWC) strength tests and multistage tests were carried out at various saturation conditions. A 3-D correlation between UCS, porosity and water saturation was recorded and the results were compared with theoretical predictions. The initial failure and collapse strengths for partially saturated, unconsolidated TWC samples were approximately 7 and 37 times their UCS values of approximately 6 kPa. The failure envelope for oil-saturated samples was weaker than water-saturated samples in multistage tests. Suction controlled tests at avoids conditions did not show a systematic increase in shear strengths with increasing suction. The strength of weak and unconsolidated pure sand is shown to be not appreciably affected by changes in water saturation. The loss of cementation and lubricating effect of pore fluids leads to reduced strength. A common failure model based on suction alone is not recommended in predicting wellbore failure for all types of materials.

AB  - This study extended Warm's (1989) weighted likelihood estimation (WLE) to a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT) setting. WLE was compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), expected a posteriori (EAP), and maximum a posteriori (MAP) using a three-dimensional 3PL IRT model under a variety of computerized adaptive testing conditions. The dependent variables included bias, standard error of ability estimates (SE), square root of mean square error (RMSE), and test information. The independent variables were ability estimation methods, intercorrelation levels between dimensions, multidimensional structures, and ability combinations. Simulation results were presented in terms of descriptive statistics, such as figures and tables. In addition, inferential procedures were used to analyze bias by conceptualizing this Monte Carlo study as a statistical sampling experiment. The results of this study indicate that WLE and the other three estimation methods yield significantly more accurate ability estimates under an approximate simple test structure with one dominant dimension and several secondary dimensions. All four estimation methods, especially WLE, yield very large SEs when a three equally dominant multidimensional structure was employed. Consistent with previous findings based on unidimensional IRT model, MLE and WLE are less biased in the extreme of the ability scale; MLE and WLE yield larger SEs than the Bayesian methods; test information-based SEs underestimate actual SEs for both MLE and WLE in MCAT situations, especially at shorter test lengths; WLE reduced the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure; test information-based SEs underestimates the actual SEs of MLE and WLE estimators in the MCAT conditions, similar to the findings of Warm (1989) in the unidimensional case. The results from the MCAT simulations did show some advantages of WLE in reducing the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure with a fixed test length of 50 items, which was consistent with the previous research findings based on different unidimensional models. It is clear from the current results that all four methods perform very poorly when the multidimensional structures with multiple dominant factors were employed. More research efforts are urged to investigate systematically how different multidimensional structures affect the accuracy and reliability of ability estimation. Based on the simulated results in this study, there is no significant effect found on the ability estimation from the intercorrelation between dimensions.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) continues to gain momentum as the accepted testing modality for a growing number of certification, licensure, education, government and human resource applications. However, the developers of these tests have for the most part failed to adequately explore the impact of individual differences such as test anxiety on the adaptive testing process. It is widely accepted that non-cognitive individual differences variables interact with the assessment of ability when using written examinations. Logic would dictate that individual differences variables would equally affect CAT. Two studies were used to explore this premise. In the first study, 507 examinees were given a test anxiety survey prior to taking a high stakes certification exam using CAT or using a written format. All examinees had already completed their course of study, and the examination would be their last hurdle prior to being awarded certification. High test anxious examinees performed worse than their low anxious counterparts on both testing formats. The second study replicated the finding that anxiety depresses performance in CAT. It also addressed the differential effect of anxiety on within test performance. Examinees were candidates taking their final certification examination following a four year college program. Ability measures were calculated for each successive part of the test for 923 subjects. Within subject performance varied depending upon test position. High anxious examinees performed poorly at all points in the test, while low and medium anxious examinee performance peaked in the middle of the test. If test anxiety and performance measures were actually the same trait, then low anxious individuals should have performed equally well throughout the test. The observed interaction of test anxiety and time on task serves as strong evidence that test anxiety has motivationally mediated as well as cognitively mediated effects. The results of the studies are discussed relative to the need for CAT developers to consider individual differences variables such as test anxiety when constructing their tests.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between examinee achievement-specific locus of control and the differences between self-adapted testing (SAT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in terms of mean estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. Subjects were 379 college students. A disordinal interaction was found between test type and locus of control. Examinees with an internal locus of control were affected positively by the SAT (relative to the CAT). For examinees with an external locus of control, however, the SAT appeared to have a negative effect on both estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. There are four tables and two figures.

AB  - This study assessed whether providing examinees with a choice between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and self-adaptive testing (SAT) affects test performance in comparison with being assigned a CAT or SAT, and evaluated variables influencing examinee choice of either test form. The relative influences of test type and test choice on examinee anxiety were also examined. Subjects were 244 undergraduate and 133 graduate students from a large midwestern university. Students were randomly assigned to SAT, CAT, and choice conditions for an algebra test. Test-related anxiety was assessed with a paper-and-pencil measure in pretests and posttests. It was found that, for students with high mathematics anxiety, providing a choice between CAT and SAT led to significantly higher mean proficiency estimates, lending support to the hypothesis that examinees can cope with a stressful situation more effectively if they feel that they have some control over the source of the stress. Expected differences in estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety between CAT and SAT conditions were not found, but a strong relationship was seen between examinee test type choice and mathematics anxiety level. Higher anxiety examinees have a greater preference for the control provided by SAT. Six tables and two graphs summarize findings. (SLD)

AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore psychometric issues pertinent to application of an IRT-based response aberrancy detection statistic in the domain of personality measurement. Monte Carlo and real-data analyses were conducted to address several issues regarding the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ response aberrancy statistic. The major issues explored were characteristics of the null distribution of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic, and its power to identify aberrant response patterns. In addition, the consistency of examinee Z$\sb{\rm L}$ level across half-tests, and the recovery of Z$\sb{\rm L}$ at different adaptive test lengths was examined. There were four main results. First, the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ index null distribution was not well standaradized when item parameters of personality scales were used; the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ null distribution variance was significantly less than the hypothesized value of 1.0 under several conditions. Second, the power of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic to detect response aberrancy was affected by the scoring method. It appeared that detection power was optimal when a biweight estimator of $\theta$ was used. Third, examinee Z$\sb{\rm L}$ level was not consistent across half-tests. This result implied that response aberrancy is not a reliable person characteristic within a particular trait domain. Finally, identifying aberrant response patterns in an adaptive testing context was problematic. A major problem was that the null distribution of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic was not consistent across adaptive test lengths. In the discussion, several recommendations are made regarding proper implementation of response aberrancy statistics in personality measurement.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an item response theory-based adaptive test of musical ability designed to overcome common shortcomings of commercially available musical ability tests. These shortcomings include test inefficiency, poor reliability and validity, ceiling effects, and examinee fatigue and boredom. Because of its suitability for item response theory-based techniques and its history in the music test field, tonal memory was chosen as the specific musical skill to be assessed. The research was conducted in three phases. The goal of the first phase was to develop item-prototypes for the adaptive test pool by determining combinations of instrumental timbre, rhythmic complexity, and tonality that provide unidimensional, unbiased and reasonably valid ability estimates. Four forms of a tonal memory test were administered to 125 college students. Results from a split-plot ANOVA of total test scores, a factor analysis of item clusters, and comparisons of test validity coefficients indicated that tonal and atonal items with synthesized timbre and varied rhythms were the most appropriate items to include in the adaptive test pool. The goal of the second phase was to select a final set of adaptive test items and assess their reliability and validity. One of three forms of a 104-item tonal memory test was administered to each of 336 high school and college students. Each form contained items matching the prototypes identified in the first phase. One hundred eighty items from phases one and two that provided good discrimination across all musical ability levels were chosen for the final adaptive test pool. Results indicated that scores based on the adaptive test items provided more reliable and valid ability estimates than two widely used conventional tests, the Seashore Tonal Memory Test and the Drake Musical Memory Test. The goal of the third phase was to assess the efficiency of the actual adaptive test by administering it to 20 examinees. An average of 6, 9 and 12 items was needed to obtain reliabilities of.80,.85, and.90 respectively. Taken as a whole these results provide compelling evidence that many shortcomings of conventional music tests can be overcome by adaptive tests. Adaptive testing appears to hold great promise for significantly improving the assessment of musical abilities. The development of adaptive tests of other musical skills is recommended.

AB  - Latent trait estimates derived from adaptive testing were evaluated as a function of item response theory model, scoring method, level of a,b item pool correlation, test length, and degree of item parameter error. 1700 simulated subjects were "administered" items from a pool of 150 items using maximum information adaptive item selection. Each simulee was tested under 100 combinations of conditions, with trait estimation precision evaluated using inaccuracy, bias, root mean square error, information, and fidelity. Results indicated little deterioration in trait estimates for realistic a, b, or c error. Very extreme b error alone or combined with other parameter error generated substantial deterioration for all models and test lengths. Shorter tests deteriorated most, and maximum likelihood (ML) scores deteriorated progressively more than Bayesian scores as item parameter error increased. r(a,b) level affected the results only at certain latent trait levels under very extreme b error. Bayesian and ML scores had equal fidelities, while ML scores excelled using information. The other indices suggested ML superiority for lesser item parameter error and Bayesian superiority as error increased. Less error was needed for Bayesian superiority under simpler models. The 2-parameter model was more precise that 1- or 3-parameter models for all but the bias index; its performance under considerable item parameter error equaled or exceeded the other two models with no item parameter error. Between-model differences were greater for Bayesian scoring, more extreme error conditions, shorter tests, and low or extreme trait values. Under extreme b error, differences varied widely but unsystematically with r(a,b). Level of r(a,b) had little or no systematic effect on precision, although precision and test length increased concomitantly. Per-item precision increments were greatest for the 1- and 3-parameter models and, at certain trait levels, for more extreme error conditions. Results suggest that latent trait estimates are robust to item parameter error, that interrelationships among variables are important considerations in adaptive testing design decisions, and that free response items should be more seriously considered.

AB  - The general objective of a research program on adaptive testing was to identify several sources of potential error in test scores, and to study adaptive testing as a means for reducing these errors. Errors can result from the mismatch of item difficulty to the individual's ability; the psychological effects of testing and the test environment; the inability to extract enough information from the testee's response; deviations from unidimensionality; and an oversimplistic conceptualization of ability. Several different strategies of adaptive testing are discussed, along with the information level they yield, and the bias that can result from various scoring methods. In a discussion of the unidimentionality of test items, the consistency of the testee's response is analyzed. Finally, group differences are examined in terms of the psychological effects of receiving immediate feedback, especially on low ability groups. The author concludes that adaptive testing and immediate knowledge of results may be able to provide testing conditions more conclusive to each person's ability to demonstrate his/her fullest capacities in test performance.

AB  - Purpose: Problems in speech recognition are often apparent in telecommunication situations. For ecologically valid assessments of such conditions, it is important to quantify the impact of real environments including acoustic conditions at a far-end communication device and all paths of transmission degradation. This study presents an automated matrix sentence test procedure based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) integrated in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure and compares the individual effects of transmission degradations with results from laboratory measurements. Method: Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in 16 normalhearing subjects in four test conditions: (a) a laboratory condition guided by a human experimenter, (b) a laboratory condition with reduced bandwidth and (c) additionally reduced headset quality to simulate typical communication systems, and (d) an automated, ASR-controlled adaptive test procedure over a real VoIP infrastructure. Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and "laboratory" conditions, with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary schools are an ideal setting to identify young people experiencing mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression. However, current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools. METHODS: This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cycles-an initial stakeholder consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for designing mental health assessment apps are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Artemis-A is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training. Future research will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Artemis-A in a range of UK secondary schools.

AB  - Background and aimsThe focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multidimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risktaking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the itembank, (2) calibrate the itembank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptomspecific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CATSUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain.DesignItem bank construction, item calibration phase, CATSUD validation phase.SettingPrimary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patienttopatient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles).Participants/casesCalibration phase: the CATSUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CATSUD.MeasurementsA total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CATSUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis.FindingsCalibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multidimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (>0.4 with the majority >0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CATSUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CATSUD (AUC=0.85).ConclusionsWe have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multidimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CATSUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

AB  - This study investigates the performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF procedures independently and in comparative terms in a computerized multistage testing (MST) environment. A simulation study was conducted to mimic an operational testing environment. Three factors that may typically affect DIF detection in an MST environment were manipulated <e2><80><93> sample size (250, 500), impact (0, 0.5, 1) and DIF magnitude (0.45, 0.9). A fourth factor (DIF method) was included at the analysis stage to understand its effect on the outcomes. The criteria for evaluating the results were Type I error rates and power rates. Results reveal that MH has better control of Type I error rates across various study conditions. With respect to power, MH was more powerful in detecting large DIF for the large sample size condition (power rate of 1.00) compared to CATSIB, which had power rates between .84 and 1.00 under the same conditions. Regression results reveal that there were interaction effects of the study factors on Type I error rates and power rates. These results will guide practitioners on best practices regarding DIF detection procedures under various conditions in computerized MST environments. This research adds to the extant literature that promotes psychometric methods that can assist in ensuring that operational test scores are aligned with the principals of item-level statistical fairness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). METHODS: All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. RESULTS: The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170+/-67s (average+/-Stdev) to answer 25+/-6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R(2) values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R(2) values of 0.5236. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

AB  - Aberrant responses, which are caused by examinees' unusual behaviors (e.g., carelessness, speededness, item pre-knowledge, warm-up, copying answers from neighbors), are frequently seen in various testing programs. Having aberrant responses may bias item parameter estimates and threaten test validity. Thus proper modeling and detection of aberrant responses is crucial both theoretically and practically in educational and psychological measurement. Previous work has primarily approached the aberrant responses research in terms of developing person fit statistics and proposing models to capture the aberrant behaviors. This dissertation attempts to incorporate change-point analysis (CPA) to investigate two types of aberrant responses: speededness and warm-up effect; both of which can be viewed as having an abrupt change point. This is an extension work of Shao, Li, and Cheng (in press) which first introduced the CPA method to detect test speededness with known item parameters. Following this line of research, three studies are carried out. The first study investigates whether CPA can help improve item calibration in the presence of speededness. In this study, the CPA method is used to first detect speeded responses with unknown item parameters. After the detection of speeded examinees as well as their corresponding speeding point (the point at which an examinee starts to speed), a cleansing procedure based upon the detected speeding point is proposed to help improve item parameter estimation. The performance of speededness detection as well as the item parameter recovery before/after utilizing the cleansing procedure are evaluated. The second study applies the CPA method to warm-up effect detection. This study first compares the impact of warm-up effect on ability estimation and examinees' classification accuracy on two types of tests: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Paper and Pencil (linear) Testing. In the second step, the CPA based detection of warm-up effect is carried out. Two methods of obtaining the critical values are utilized in the study. Different from the first two studies which both conduct CPA using item response information, the third study applies CPA to response time data in speededness detection. A gradual change log-normal model is proposed to better model the real-life change of response time affected by speededness. Two test statistics are introduced to test for a change point using response time. Moreover, this study explores the possibility of using a fixed critical value across conditions at each nominal level so that practitioners do not have to obtain a critical value through simulation every time they run speededness detection. The dissertation thesis concludes with the final chapter including a discussion of the results, limitations, practical implications, and future directions.

AB  - It is known that the stiffness of many soils is higher at small strains than at the large strains used in typical triaxial testing. Understanding this initial high stiffness and the factors affecting it is key to accurate displacement predictions. The recent stress history (RSH) effect describes how the stiffness degradation curve at small strains is affected by the immediately preceding stress path. The effect is usually described in terms of stress path rotation angle between an approach path and the shear probe upon which stiffness degradation is measured. The principle aim of the work was to investigate the relationship between the RSH effect, approach path length, and time dependent effects in more detail. A combination of physical testing and simulations with the BRICK constitutive model were used to achieve this. This has shown that in multistage testing the residual RSH effect from the first test increased the stiffness exhibited in the second, thus masking the natural behaviour. In addition the stress path rotation from consolidation to testing caused a stiffness reduction in the first test. This effect, newly termed recent consolidation history (RCH), was found to be degraded by the first test and so did not impact on the second. When allowance was made for these effects trends seen in the literature were supported. Due to the complex stress paths used in the physical testing, a number of improvements were required to the strain rate dependent (SRD) BRICK model to allow accurate simulations to be run. These included implementation of a bisecting iteration within the strain calculations, and a coordinate decent routine to allow creep and creep rupture to be modelled. The model was then used to simulate the physical tests to allow more insight into the interplay between the effects identified in the physical testing, ultimately supporting the conclusions drawn.

AB  - Fueled by rapid technological and methodological development, research in the area of genetic epidemiology has brought many successes as well as analytical challenges in identification of genetic risk factors for disease risk. Many have predicted that the detection of heritable disease susceptibility variants could eventually lead to stable models for prediction of disease risk. This dissertation is devoted to the statistical methodological consideration and development in genetic association studies, as well as the use of weighted genetic risk score in predictive modeling of disease risk. We begin the work by reviewing a brief background into genetic association studies, predictive modeling and relevant analytic challenges. In Chapter 2, we discuss the theoretical relationship between classical multiple linear regression (MLR) and two-stage residual-outcome regression analysis (2SR) in terms of confounding adjustment. We demonstrate that the 2SR would introduce bias and loss of power in the presence of confounding, and thus remind researchers to be cautious in applying the 2SR in genetic association studies. In Chapter 3, we propose an adaptive permutation procedure in testing the significance of susceptibility genetic variants. Results show that the adaptive test is statistically valid as well as computationally feasible in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recommendations are made for the implementation of adaptive permutation in real studies. In Chapter 4, we develop an explained-variance based genetic risk score (GRS) for predictive modeling of disease risk. Extensive simulation studies suggest that this new weighted GRS is a robust risk score approach that consistently outperforms simple count and odds ratio based GRS approaches. In Chapter 5, we further explore the performance of GRS approaches in the presence of interactions, including statistical interaction, dependence and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results emphasize the advantage of weighted GRS even in more complicated settings, motivating its application in predictive modeling. This work concludes with several practical guidelines in genetic association studies and predictive modeling, and discussions of future perspectives.

AB  - Both theoretical and practical considerations have led the revision of the Graduate Record Examinations<c2><ae> (GRE<c2><ae>) revised General Test, here called the rGRE, to adopt a multistage adaptive design that will be continuously or nearly continuously administered and that can provide immediate score reporting. These circumstances sharply constrain the available options for equating or linking together the thousands of unique test forms that will need to be administered each year. The only practical method is to pre-equate each form through item response theory (IRT) methods. Unfortunately, doing so means that item position and context effects are both vitally important and potentially difficult to control. This study examines item position effects in a GRE context and attempts to assess the extent to which they may affect the rGRE. It was found that position effects are in fact present in GRE data and that they can be particularly troublesome under multistage testing. Pretest strategies are able to mitigate effects to some degree, but complete control will require careful attention be paid to the time limits and associated test configuration details in the design of the rGRE.

AB  - Although social well-being (SWB) is recognized as an integral component of health, it is rarely included in health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments. Two SWB dimensions were identified by literature review: social support (SWB-SS) and social function (SWB-SF). As part of a larger project to develop item response theory-derived item banks and computerized adaptive testing, we developed and tested items for the SWB banks. Item ratings of three large (n greater than 600) datasets were conducted by 15 reviewers. Rasch measurement analyses were conducted to initially define item hierarchies. Out of 83 total items, 8 were removed due to model misfit and 8 were removed because of overlapping item content. We then wrote 11 new SWB-SS and 16 new SWB-SF items to fill content gaps, and edited items to improve comprehension and consistency. A total of 94 items (65 SWB-SS, 29 SWB-SF) was administered by computer to 202 cancer patients. Confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch analyses, and evaluations of construct validity were performed. Patients commented favorably on the content of the items and expressed appreciation for attention to this aspect of their HRQL. Using current psychometric standards for unidimensionality, reliability, and content and construct validity, we derived six preliminary item banks for social support (instrumental support, informational support, positive and negative emotional support, positive and negative social companionship) and two for social function (limitations and satisfaction). The empirical construct hierarchy was consistent with clinical observations; e.g., hobbies and leisure activities tended to reflect more limitations, while meeting the needs of family and friends tended to reflect fewer limitations. Optimal care for patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses includes obtaining a complete picture of patients' physical and properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment.psychosocial health status. SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With

AB  - In the current environment of federally mandated high-stakes testing, teachers and schools are under great pressure to ensure that students demonstrate proficiency on state assessments. Without formative feedback that connects what a teacher did in the classroom with positive outcomes on the state assessment, a teacher may not feel that he or she can make a difference in how students fare on the state assessment. Teachers who experience low self-efficacy use less effective teaching techniques, and this affects student learning. Many schools are now using computer adaptive testing, such as the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA-MAP), to provide teachers with formative information to use for instructional improvement. When adjustments to instruction result in higher student achievement, it can provide the teacher with mastery experiences that increase the teacher's efficacy perceptions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teachers' efficacy beliefs for making a difference in their students' performances on the state assessment and teachers' uses of NWEA-MAP test results. Teachers were surveyed using four measures of teacher efficacy and collective teacher efficacy. Two measures that were created for this study demonstrated high reliability with the study sample and correlated well with the two existing scales. Data were also collected on the ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information and the number of different ways they used score information. The results indicated that the number of ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information made a significant difference in teachers' scores on the efficacy measures: Using score information in three or four different ways was associated with the highest scores on the efficacy scales. Also, using test score information to set goals with students and to individualize instruction predicted teachers' efficacy scores to a greater degree than did using scores to adjust curriculum and instruction. The current study, with its two new measures and its suggestions of relationships between variables, provides a starting point for new lines of research in sources of teacher efficacy beliefs.

AB  - This thesis addresses three aspects of movement, performance and perception in music performance. First, the playing of an accent, a simple but much used and practiced element in drumming is studied, second, the perception of gradually changing tempo, and third, the perception and communication of specific emotional intentions through movements during music performance. Papers I and II investigated the execution and interpretation of an accent in drumming, performed under different playing conditions. Players' movements, striking velocities and timing patterns were studied for different tempi, dynamic levels and striking surfaces. It was found that the players used differing movement strategies and that interpreted the accent differently, reflected in their movement trajectories. Strokes at higher dynamic levels were played from a greater average height and with higher striking velocities. All players initiated the accented strokes from a greater height, and delivered the accent with increased striking velocity compared to the unaccented strokes. The interval beginning with the accented stroke was also prolonged, generally by delaying the following stroke. Recurrent cyclic patterns were found in the players' timing performances. In a listening test, listeners perceived grouping of the strokes according to the cyclic patterns. Paper III concerned the perception of gradual tempo changes in auditory sequences. Using an adaptive test procedure subjects judged stimuli consisting of click sequences with either increasing or decreasing tempo, respectively. Each experiment included three test sessions at different nominal tempi (80, 120, and 180 beats per minute). The results showed that ten of the eleven subjects showed an inherent bias in their perception of tempo drift. The direction and magnitude of the bias was consistent between test sessions but varied between individuals. The just noticeable differences for tempo drift agreed well with the estimated tempo drifts in production data, but were much smaller than earlier reported thresholds for tempo drift. Paper IV studied how emotional intent in music performances is conveyed to observers through the movements of the musicians. Three players of marimba, bassoon, and saxophone respectively, were filmed when playing with the expressive intentions Happiness, Sadness, Anger and Fear. Observers rated the emotional content and movement cues in the videos clips shown without sound. The results showed that the observers were able to identify the intentions Sadness, Anger, and Happiness, but not Fear. The rated movement cues showed that an Angry performance was characterized by jerky movements, Happy performances by large, and somewhat fast and jerky movements, and Sad performances by slow, and smooth movements.

AB  - Differential item functioning (DIF) is an important issue in large scale standardized testing. DIF refers to the unexpected difference in item performances among groups of equally proficient examinees, usually classified by ethnicity or gender. Its presence could seriously affect the validity of inferences drawn from a test. Various statistical methods have been proposed to detect and estimate DIF. This dissertation addresses DIF analysis in the context of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whose item selection algorithm adapts to the ability level of each individual examinee. In a CAT, a DIF item may be more consequential and more detrimental be cause fewer items are administered in a CAT than in a traditional paper-and-pencil test and because the remaining sequence of items presented to examinees depends in part on their responses to the DIF item. Consequently, an efficient, stable and flexible method to detect and estimate CAT DIF becomes necessary and increasingly important. We propose simultaneous implementations of online calibration and DIF testing. The idea is to perform online calibration of an item of interest separately in the focal and reference groups. Under any specific parametric IRT model, we can use the (online) estimated latent traits as covariates and fit a nonlinear regression model to each of the two groups. Because of the use of the estimated, not the true , the regression fit has to adjust for the covariate 'measurement errors'. It turns out that this situation fits nicely into the framework of nonlinear error-in-variable modelling, which has been extensively studied in statistical literature. We develop two bias-correction methods using asymptotic expansion and conditional score theory. After correcting the bias caused by measurement error, one can perform a significance test to detect DIF with the parameter estimates for different groups. This dissertation also discusses some general techniques to handle measurement error modelling with different IRT models, including the three-parameter normal ogive model and polytomous response models. Several methods of estimating DIF are studied as well. Large sample properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies show that the resulting methods perform well in terms of Type-I error rate control, accuracy in estimating DIF and power against both unidirectional and crossing DIF.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained increased popularity during the last decades. Consequently, admissions tests such as the GRE, the TOEFL, as well as other certification and licensure exams have been transformed from their paper-and-pencil versions to computerized adaptive versions. However, a major difference between the two test formats, from an examinee's point of view, is that examinees are usually not allowed to revise their answers on CATs. Some researchers feel that the validity of a CAT can increase with item review, since it allows them to rethink their answers and make corrections to items that have been misread or miskeyed. Other researchers believe that item review can decrease the efficiency and validity of a CAT since item review allows examinees to cheat on the test. The purpose of this study was to test the efficiency of a <e2><80><98> rearrangement procedure<e2><80><99> that rearranges and skips certain items in order to better estimate the examinees' abilities. This was examined through a simulation study. This rearrangement procedure permits examinees to change their answers on a CAT without allowing them to artificially inflate their test scores. If this procedure were adopted, it could help reduce the stress of examinees who feel that they have more control over the testing situation when they can revise their answers. This procedure could also help improve the reliability and validity of the CAT since errors due to misread and miskeyed answers would be corrected. The results of this simulation study have shown that when the Maximum Likelihood estimation was used, the rearrangement procedure was effective in reducing the bias of the ability estimates. With the Bayesian estimation, the rearrangement procedure increased the reliability, and slightly decreased the standard error of the estimates. However, the Bayesian method was not effective in reducing the bias of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure. There were not many differences in the accuracy of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure, when three or five items were reviewed. There were also very small differences in the effects that the item pool size had on the accuracy of the ability estimates after the rearrangement procedure.

AB  - This study developed a model to simulate nonmodel-fitting responses in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment, and to examine the effectiveness of the model. The underlying idea was to simulate examinees' test behaviors realistically. This study simulated a situation in which examinees are exposed to or are coached on test items before actual testing. The multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) (M. Reckase, 1985) model was adopted for this study. Test characteristic curves and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were investigated. The results indicate that the probability of an examinee responding to an item correctly and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were influenced by the severity and the number of affected items. The results also suggest that the proposed model might be an effective tool for investigating the issue of nonmodel-fitting responses in a CAT environment. (Contains 7 figures and 39 references.)

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well academic, demographic, and programmatic variables could explain and predict variation in graduate performance on NCLEX-RN in one baccalaureate nursing program. The study specifically sought to address the void in empirical research in the area of programmatic variables predictive of NCLEX-RN performance. The study also investigated whether the changes made in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to computer adaptive testing (CAT), which was initiated in 1994, could help explain variations experience in program pass rate between 1990 and 1996. The population was composed of 360 May and June graduates from one baccalaureate nursing program. The research method used in this study was an archival survey. Analysis of t-tests and z-tests showed that the two outcome groups (pass group and fail group) differed significantly (p $<$.05) in terms of gender and ethnicity. Moreover, the two groups differed significantly in terms of many academic variables (ACT Composite score; admission, freshman, sophomore, junior, cumulative, nursing and science GPA's; and number of nursing and support courses repeated). In the final logistic regression model, four of the independent variables; gender (SEX), nursing GPA, number of nursing and support courses repeated (REPEAT), and the mean educational level of the clinical nursing faculty (C-ED), were found to be significant predictors of NCLEX-RN performance (p $<$.05; one-tailed probability). The author concluded that male and minority students, and student who have repeated nursing and support courses, are at risk for failure on NCLEX-RN. Additionally, because the education of the clinical faculty proved to affect graduate odds for success on NCLEX-RN, it was recommended that programs strive to attract, recruit, and retain highly qualified clinical faculty. When added to the regression equation, the version of the NCLEX-RN did not prove to be statistically significant. The researcher concluded, therefore, that the change in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to CAT did not contribute to the variations in the NCLEX-RN pass rate experienced by this nursing program.

AB  - While the psychometric and statistical models underlying the design of computer adaptive tests (CAT) are well understood, relatively few working models exist for the purpose of foreign language assessment. Likewise, little has been published concerning the practical considerations affecting the implementation of such tests. in the process of constructing the Monash/Melbourne French CAT, we discovered much about putting testing theory into practice. The present paper reports this experience in three parts. In a preliminary section, we describe the academic context in which the French CAT was created and trialed. This is followed by a detailed consideration of the test presentation platform and operating algorithms. Lastly, we give an evaluation of the first administration of the French CAT, accompanied by a discussion of the test's reliability and validity as a placement instrument for first year Australian university students.

AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty. The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data. Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

AB  - The major objective of this investigation was to test experimentally the relative validity of simulating hot strip rolling by compression testing at constant true strain rates under axisymmetric conditions. For the purpose of the simulation, the material's flow through the roll gap was theoretically modelled. Isothermal, single- and multi-stage compression tests were carried out on a microprocessor-controlled servohydraulic testing system by using a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel. Cylindrical specimens were subjected to deformation at rates of strain either constant or varying as during a rolling pass/passes. True stress-true strain flow curves were obtained by correcting the measured stress-strain data for the effect of friction at the specimen/die interface. The constant friction shear factor was determined quantitatively by hot ring tests. Optical microscopy was used to observe the prior austenite microstructures. Based on the results of single-stage, constant true strain-rate tests, the dependence of the flow strength as a function of strain, rate of strain and temperature was modelled by using an Arrhenius-type equation. The comparison of the responses of the material to the two types of compression revealed no significant differences between flow curves except at the very end of the tests. This observation agreed with the predictions of the model, which was developed based on the constant strain-rate flow curves, indicating that the material follows a mechanical equation of state in hot rolling processes. The flow curves and the average flow strengths were compared between the constant and varying strain-rate, four-stage tests. Differences were also found negligible. The variation of the average flow strength during multistage testing was dependent of the length of the interpass time and the average strain rate in a significant manner. It was found that the microstructures developed from single- as well as multi-stage compression tests were independent of the variation of the strain rate during deformation. This study showed that the constant true strain-rate compression testing is a very useful technique in simulating hot flat strip rolling processes.

AB  - The object of this research programme was to investigate the stability of a silty clay under undrained repeated loading. Equipment has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading. This model can be used to predict pore pressures and failure for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils.

AB  - Background: There is a need for shorter-length assessments that capture patient questionnaire data while attaining high data quality without an undue response burden on patients. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods have the potential to meet these needs and can offer attractive options to shorten questionnaire lengths. Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT or CART was best suited to reduce the number of questionnaire items in multiple domains (eg, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and social support) used for a needs assessment procedure (NAP) within the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) without the loss of data quality. Methods: NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a Web-based portal, MyCARDSS, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results: With CAT and CART, an overall reduction of 36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length, respectively, was achieved, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT, 0.777 and 0.877 for classification trees, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees, respectively. Conclusions: Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the NAP used within the field of CR. CART, however, showed the best performance, with a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress in multiple domains. For CR professionals, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their patients by providing real-time patient measurements.

Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS<c2><ae> computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS<c2><ae> CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS<c2><ae> domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS<c2><ae> anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS<c2><ae> CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

AB  - In the last two decades or so, some of the substantial advances in machine learning relate to sampling techniques. For example, boosting uses weighted sampling to improve model training, and active learning uses unlabeled data gathered so far to decide what are the most relevant data points to ask an oracle to label. This thesis introduces a novel sampling technique that uses features entropy to guide the sampling, a process we call informed sampling. The central idea is that the reliability of model parameter learning may be more sensitive to variables that have low, or high entropy. Therefore, adapting the sampling rate of variables based on their entropy may lead to better parameter estimates. In a series of papers, we first test this hypothesis for three classifier models, Logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and over a binary classification task with a 0<e2><80><93>1 loss function. The results show that the high-entropy sampling (higher sampling rate for high entropy variables) systematically improves the prediction performance of the TAN classifier. However, for the NB and LR classifiers, the picture is more blurry. Improvements are obtained for only half of the 11 datasets used, and often the improvements come from high-entropy sampling, seldom from low-entropy sampling. This first experiment is replicated in a second study, this time using a more realistic context where the entropy of variables is unknown a priori, but instead is estimated with seed data and adjusted on the fly. Results showed that using a seed dataset of 1% of the total number of instances, which ranged from a few hundreds to around 1000, the improvements obtained from the former study hold for TAN with an average improvement of 13% in RMSE reduction. For the same seed size improvements were also obtained for the Naive Bayes classifier by a factor of 8% from low instead of high entropy sampling. Also, the pattern of improvements for LR was almost the same as obtained from the former study. Notwithstanding that classifier improvements can be obtained through informed sampling, but that the pattern of improvements varies across the informed sampling approach and the classifier model, we further investigate how the imputation methods affect this pattern. This question is of high importance because informed sampling necessarily implies missing values, and many classifiers either require the imputation of missing values, or can be improved by imputation. Therefore imputation and informative sampling are likely to be combined in practice. The obvious question is whether the gains obtained from each are additive or if they relate in a more complex manner. The gain from imputation methods are first studied in isolation with a comparative analysis of the performance of some new and some well known imputation algorithms, with the objective of determining to which extent the pattern of improvements is stable across classifiers for the binary classification and 0<e2><80><93>1 loss function. Here too, results show that patterns of improvement of imputation algorithms can vary substantially per model and also per missing value rate. We also investigate the improvements along a different dimension which is whether the rate of sampling per record is stable or varies. Minor, but statistically significant differences are observed in the results, showing that this dimension can also affect classifier performance. In a final paper, first the levels of improvement from informed sampling are compared with those from a number of imputation techniques. Next, we empirically investigate whether the gains obtained from sampling and imputation are additive, or they combine in a more complex manner. The results show that the individual gains from informed sampling and imputation are within the same range and that combining high-entropy informed sampling with imputation brings significant gains to the classifiers' performance, but generally, not as a simple sum of the individual improvements. It is also noteworthy that despite the encouraging results for some combinations of informed sampling and imputation algorithms, detailed analysis of individual dataset results reveals that these combinations rarely bring classification performance above the top imputation algorithms or informed sampling by themselves. The results of our studies provide evidence of the effectiveness of informed sampling to improve the binary classification performance of the TAN model. Also, high-entropy sampling is shown to be the most preferable scheme to be conducted. This for example, in the context of Computerized Adaptive Testing, can be translated to favoring the highly uncertain questions (items of average difficulty). Variable number of items administered is another factor that should be taken into account when imputation is involved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS) is a common foot disorder; however, there is limited clinical evidence on which to base treatment. Repeated clinical observations indicating heel pain during heel rise and minisquat on the affected leg, involving activation of posterior calf muscles, formed the basis of this study. OBJECTIVE: To compare deep massage therapy to posterior calf muscles and neural mobilization with a self-stretch exercise program (DMS) to a common treatment protocol of ultrasound therapy to the painful heel area with the same self-stretch exercises (USS). METHODS: Patients with PHPS were assigned to a program of 8 treatments over a period of 4-6 weeks in a single-blind randomized clinical trial. Functional status (FS) at admission and discharge from therapy as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included in the trial (mean age 53, standard deviation (SD) 13, range 25-86, 57% women), 36 received DMS treatment and 33 with USS. The overall group-by-time interaction for the mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was found statistically significant (p=0.034), with a change of (mean (confidence interval, CI)) 15 (9-21) and 6 (1-11) FS points for the DMS and USS groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Data indicated that both treatment protocols resulted in an overall short-term improvement, however, DMS treatment was significantly more effective in treating PHPS than USS treatment.

AB  - Purpose. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for measuring health status in knee osteoarthritis. Method. Three hundred and fifty-one patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) answered 118 questions from a range of widely used questionnaires. Three dimensions relevant to knee OA were identified by expert opinion as 'pain, mental and emotional status'; 'self-care and household activities' and 'mobility and social activities'. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the relationship between the items and their dimensions. After CFA, these dimensions were subjected to Rasch analysis to calibrate the items onto an interval scale. A CAT was developed for each dimension, and the results checked against simulated applications from 10,000 simulees. Results. After CFA and Rasch analysis, 14, 22 and 23 items remained in the first, second and third dimensions, respectively. Items were mostly free of differential item functioning for age, gender and duration of disease. Reliability exceeded 0.87 for each dimension. The health status levels generated using item banks and those obtained from the simulated CAT application were highly correlated (i.e. >0.91 for each dimension). On average, 8, 10 and 10 items were used to estimate the health status levels using the CAT for the first, second and third dimensions respectively. Conclusions. Using a combination approach of CFA and Rasch analysis, this study has shown that it is possible to calibrate items onto a single metric in a way that can be used to provide the basis of a CAT application.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated the combination of item response theory and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for psychiatric measurement as a means of reducing the burden of research and clinical assessments. Methods: Data were from 800 participants in outpatient treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder; they completed 616 items of the 626-item Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Scales (MASS) at two times. The first administration was used to design and evaluate a CAT version of the MASS by using post hoc simulation. The second confirmed the functioning of CAT in live testing. Results: Tests of competing models based on item response theory supported the scale's bifactor structure, consisting of a primary dimension and four group factors (mood, panic-agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, and social phobia). Both simulated and live CAT showed a 95% average reduction (585 items) in items administered (24 and 30 items, respectively) compared with administration of the full MASS. The correlation between scores on the full MASS and the CAT version was .93. For the mood disorder subscale, differences in scores between two groups of depressed patients--one with bipolar disorder and one without--on the full scale and on the CAT showed effect sizes of .63 (p < .003) and 1.19 (p < .001) standard deviation units, respectively, indicating better discriminant validity for CAT. Conclusions: Instead of using small fixed-length tests, clinicians can create item banks with a large item pool, and a small set of the items most relevant for a given individual can be administered with no loss of information, yielding a dramatic reduction in administration time and patient and clinician burden.

AB  - In this study, we investigated how manipulations of voice similarity affect talker discrimination judgments in children. More specifically, we addressed the question of how different must two sentences be in terms of their average fundamental & formant frequencies for children to categorize these utterances as spoken by different talkers? Same-different judgments were obtained using an adaptive testing procedure in which the similarity of voice pairs was systematically varied. Participants included 5-year-old normal-hearing children & cochlear implant (CI) users ages 5-12 years, implanted at or before age 6 years with 2+ years of implant experience. Stimuli consisted of natural sentence-length utterances resynthesized to form a stimulus continuum of similar-sounding voices. The probability of "different talker" judgments was examined for each listener group as a function of pitch difference size. We compared this measure of "acceptable within-talker variability" under two different presentation conditions, one in which the linguistic content of the sentence was held constant & one in which the linguistic content was varied. We found that the spectral envelopes of two utterances, together with their average fundamental frequencies, needed to differ by at least 11-16% for normal-hearing children to perceive the voices as belonging to different talkers. Normal-hearing children maintained the perception of voice individuality over a larger frequency shift than previously studied normal-hearing adults. Although several individual children with implants exhibited response patterns that resembled those of normal-hearing children, most of the hearing-impaired children experienced difficulty perceiving even large differences between talkers. Both groups of children displayed essentially the same pattern of responses in both the "fixed sentence" & "varied sentence" conditions, indicating no effect of linguistic variability on the children's criteria for identifying two talkers as the same or different. Greater variability in performance was observed, however, in the varied sentence condition for both listener groups. Finally, within the CI group, higher spoken word recognition scores were found to be associated with better talker discrimination performance. Our results suggest that poor discrimination of pitch & timbre-based differences is a factor contributing to implanted children's difficulty with talker discrimination tasks; implications of this finding are discussed in detail. 4 Tables, 12 Figures, 4 Appendixes, 110 References.

AB  - For the training of academic skills, digital educational games with integrated adaptivity are promising. Adaptive games are considered superior to non-adaptive games, because they constantly assess children's performance, and accordingly adapt the difficulty of the tasks corresponding to the children's individual level. However, empirical evidence with regard to the effectivity of adaptive compared to non-adaptive games is limited. A study was conducted with 191 children from the third year of Kindergarten who were enrolled in one of three conditions, that is, playing an adaptive version of the reading game (RG), a non-adaptive version of the RG or training with pen-and-paper exercises. In all three conditions, children trained emergent reading (phonological awareness and letter knowledge) once a week for 30?min over a period of 5?weeks. Children's performance on cognitive (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, reading fluency) and non-cognitive (motivation, self-concept) factors was assessed. Results revealed a significant improvement in phonological awareness and letter knowledge in all conditions. However, no differences between the conditions were observed with respect to children's improvement on phonological awareness and letter knowledge or on their post-test scores for reading fluency. With regard to motivation and self-concept, again, no differences in these non-cognitive factors were observed across conditions.

AB  - The clinical assessment of mental disorders can be a time-consuming and error-prone procedure, consisting of a sequence of diagnostic hypothesis formulation and testing aimed at restricting the set of plausible diagnoses for the patient. In this article, we propose a novel computerized system for the adaptive testing of psychological disorders. The proposed system combines a mathematical representation of psychological disorders, known as the "formal psychological assessment," with an algorithm designed for the adaptive assessment of an individual's knowledge. The assessment algorithm is extended and adapted to the new application domain. Testing the system on a real sample of 4,324 healthy individuals, screened for obsessive-compulsive disorder, we demonstrate the system's ability to support clinical testing, both by identifying the correct critical areas for each individual and by reducing the number of posed questions with respect to a standard written questionnaire.

AB  - Increased use of course management software to administer course exams online for face-to-face classes raises the question of how well test anxiety and other emotions generalize from the classroom to an online setting. We hypothesized that administering regular course exams in an online format would reduce test anxiety experienced at the time of the exam and improve exam scores. We recruited 69 participants from a psychology course to take classroom- and online-delivered exams, using a counterbalanced crossover design. We found that students who normally experience high levels of test anxiety in the classroom had reduced test anxiety when taking online exams, while the reverse was true for those low in classroom anxiety. Furthermore, the relationship between test anxiety and exam performance was weaker in an online setting than in the classroom. We recommend that instructors evaluate the potential impact of these findings when considering offering examinations online. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Compared easy and difficult versions of self-adapted tests (SATs) and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) among a sample of 187 high school students (aged 17<e2><80><93>19 yrs). No significant differences were found among the 4 tests (easy vs difficult SAT, easy vs difficult CAT) for either estimated ability or posttest state anxiety. Significant differences were found for the number of correct responses, testing time, anxiety change, and standard error of ability. The difficulty manipulation was successful as easy and difficult tests differed in the number of items passed. Conditions with high percentage of items passed produced less posttest than pretest anxiety for both SATs and the easy CATs. In the difficult CAT condition, the number of correct responses was lower and posttest anxiety exceeded pretest anxiety. Results suggest that SAT research should continue to take into account the variable 'number of items passed' as it may hide the effects on anxiety when CATs and SATs are compared. The 2 easy conditions show good psychometric and motivational characteristics. However, the easy CAT gave a higher precision than the easy SAT.

AB  - Compared the efficiency, reliability, validity, and motivational benefits of computerized adaptive tests and self-adapted music listening tests (CAT and SAT, respectively). 53 junior high school music students (mean age 13.04 yrs) completed a tonal memory CAT, a tonal memory SAT, standardized music aptitude and achievement tests; and questionnaires assessing test anxiety, demographics, and attitudes about the CAT and SAT. Standardized music test scores and music course grades served as criterion measures in the concurrent validity analysis. Results showed that the SAT elicited more favorable attitudes from examinees and yielded ability estimates that were higher and less correlated with test anxiety than did the CAT. The CAT, however, required fewer items and less administration time to match the reliability and concurrent validity of the SAT and yielded higher levels of reliability and concurrent validity than the SAT when test length was held constant. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A pilot study on the development and administration of a test using a spatial reasoning problem, the 15-puzzle, is described. The test utilizes on-line capabilities of a real-time computer to record an examinee's progress on each problem through a sequence of problem-solving "moves", and to collect additional on-line data that might be of relevance to the evaluation of examinee performance. The examinees, 61 students in an introductory psychology class, were required to type a sequence of moves that would bring an array of scrambled numbers (start configuration) into agreement with a second array (goal configuration), using as few moves as possible. Results suggest that four performance indices might be useful in indexing problem difficulty: (1) mean number of moves in the sample; (2) proportion of students solving the problem; (3) proportion of students solving the problem in the optimal number of moves; and (4) a Special Difficulty Index, defined as the sample mean number of moves divided by the minimum number of moves required. Additional methods of scoring test and individual problem performance are studied. (Author/RL)

AB  - Purpose: In the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), seven domains (Physical Function, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Social Function, and Pain Interference) are packaged together as profiles. Each of these domains can also be assessed using computer adaptive tests (CATs) or short forms (SFs) of varying length (e.g., 4, 6, and 8 items). We compared the accuracy and number of items administrated of CAT versus each SF. Methods: PROMIS instruments are scored using item response theory (IRT) with graded response model and reported as T scores (mean = 50, SD = 10). We simulated 10,000 subjects from the normal distribution with mean 60 for symptom scales and 40 for function scales, and standard deviation 10 in each domain. We considered a subject<e2><80><99>s score to be accurate when the standard error (SE) was less than 3.0. We recorded range of accurate scores (accurate range) and the number of items administrated. Results: The average number of items administrated in CAT was 4.7 across all domains. The accurate range was wider for CAT compared to all SFs in each domain. CAT was notably better at extending the accurate range into very poor health for Fatigue, Physical Function, and Pain Interference. Most SFs provided reasonably wide accurate range. Conclusions: Relative to SFs, CATs provided the widest accurate range, with slightly more items than SF4 and less than SF6 and SF8. Most SFs, especially longer ones, provided reasonably wide accurate range. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Chronic pain affects U.S. service member<e2><80><99>s (SMs) more disproportionately than individuals in the general public. SMs have unique cultural pressures to ignore or deny acute pain; therefore, the beliefs and behaviors of this group may cause them to self-report their acute pain in a specific manner. This study evaluated the strength of the relationship of the patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) upper extremity computer adaptive test (CAT) and assessed U.S. active duty SMs experience of acute pain and function compared to the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (QuickDASH). In addition, the PROMIS pain interference CAT, PROMIS pain behavior CAT, and PROMIS anxiety CAT were correlated to the PROMIS upper extremity CAT and QuickDASH questionnaires. Materials and Methods: This mixed methods, sequential, explanatory study included a convenience sample of 26 participants from two occupational therapy clinics. Participants were administered five self-report questionnaires at initial evaluation and at follow up (30<e2><80><93>90 day). At follow up, 12 participants completed a semi-structured interview. Categorical variables were summarized using percentages and analyzed using a chi-square goodness of fit test. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the linear relationship between the QuickDASH and specified PROMIS questionnaires. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brooke Army Medical Center, reference number C.2017.173d. Results: The initial and follow up scores from the self-report questionnaires demonstrated a good to excellent correlation between the PROMIS upper extremity CAT and the QuickDASH (r = <e2><80><93>0.65; r = <e2><80><93>0.81; p < 0.001). Qualitative data were gathered during a semi-structured interview of 12 participants after the follow up and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Three themes emerged from qualitative analysis of data: (1) impact of military culture, (2) psychosocial effects of acute pain, and (3) therapist contributions to disability awareness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates several cultural and psychosocial influences concerning the experience of SMs with acute UE disability and pain, which were not previously reported for this population.

AB  - On the basis of 8 standards of mental health, the researchers worked out one psychological scale Self-report Inventory for Shanghai Middle School Students (SISMSS). This scale consists of three parts, i.e. adaptive testing, illness diagnostic test and validity scale. Adaptive testing including 8 branch-tests, namely, active study, steady and optimistic emotion, self-cognition, sense of duty, achievement motivation, communication ability, sex consciousness and self-control ability. Illness diagnostic test including 7 branch-tests, namely, subschizophrenia, sub-depression, mania, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, phobia and hysteria. The research results indicate that the coefficient of internal consistency of SISMSS is 0.9081 (p<0.01). In addition, coefficient of correlation with SCL-90 is 0.58 and 0.734 with MHT. The construct validity of adaptive testing is also verified by factor analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examines the effect of altering test difficulty on examinee ability measures and test length in a computer adaptive test. The 225 Ss were randomly assigned to 3 test difficulty conditions and given a variable length computer adaptive test. Examinees in the hard, medium, and easy test condition took a test targeted at the 50%, 60%, or 70% probability of correct response. The results show that altering the probability of a correct response does not affect estimation of examinee ability and that taking an easier computer adaptive test only slightly increases the number of items necessary to reach specified levels of precision.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored the performance of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety assessment relative to the Depression assessment in orthopedic patients, the relationship between Anxiety with self-reported Physical Function and Pain Interference, and to determine if Anxiety levels varied according to the location of orthopedic conditions. Methods: This cross-sectional evaluation analyzed 14,962 consecutive adult new-patient visits to a tertiary orthopedic practice between 4/1/2016 and 12/31/2016. All patients completed PROMIS Anxiety, Depression, Physical Function, and Pain Interference computer adaptive tests (CATs) as routine clinical intake. Patients were grouped by the orthopedic service providing care and categorized as either affected with Anxiety if scoring > 62 based on linkage to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 survey. Spearman correlations between the PROMIS scores were calculated. Bivariate statistics assessed differences in Anxiety and Depression scores between patients of different orthopedic services. Results: 20% of patients scored above the threshold to be considered affected by Anxiety. PROMIS Anxiety scores demonstrated a stronger correlation than Depression scores with Physical Function and Pain Interference scores. Patients with spine conditions reported the highest median Anxiety scores and were more likely to exceed the Anxiety threshold than patients presenting to sports or upper extremity surgeons. Conclusions: One in five new orthopedic patients reports Anxiety levels that may warrant intervention. This rate is heightened in patients needing spine care. Patient-reported Physical Function more strongly correlates with PROMIS Anxiety than Depression suggesting that the Anxiety CAT is a valuable addition to assess mental health among orthopedic patients. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic level III. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: The PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Health Organization has compiled and calibrated item banks for various domains in the United States, and these item banks have been translated into Dutch language. Methods: The item banks for Anxiety and Depression have been administered in two samples, one drawn from the Dutch general and one drawn from the Dutch clinical population. The aim of this study was to investigate the appropriateness of the official PROMIS item parameters for these item banks that have been estimated based on data collected in the United States for use in the Netherlands. For both domains, we determined the fit of U.S. item parameters, the effect on individual domain scores and levels, the effect on correlations with full item bank totals, and the effect on classification accuracies of adaptive test scores for diagnoses of anxiety and mood disorders. Results: The results showed that especially in the clinical population sample, fit appeared to be problematic for many items. However, simulations revealed that both sets of item parameters (official PROMIS vs. unique Dutch) perform nearly equally well in practice. Conclusion: We tentatively conclude that the official PROMIS item parameters can be used for scaling respondents in the Netherlands. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by Robert D. Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2008-17448-005[/rid]). Gibbons and colleagues' article highlights an emerging methodology of considerable value to psychiatric services. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has multiple advantages over standard paper-and-pencil assessment tools. CAT uses existing data to streamline and individualize the measurement process. By selecting items of particular relevance to an individual respondent, CAT applications simultaneously reduce the number of needed questions, increase measurement precision, and decrease respondent burden. CAT's applicability has been demonstrated, but its full potential for psychiatric services has yet to be realized. Unfortunately, the technology and infrastructure needed to implement CAT are currently beyond the reach of most clinicians and researchers.

AB  - A new type of self-adapted test (S-AT), called Assisted Self-Adapted Test (AS-AT), is presented. It differs from an ordinary S-AT in that prior to selecting the difficulty category, the computer advises examinees on their best difficulty category choice, based on their previous performance. Three tests (computerized adaptive test, AS-AT, and S-AT) were compared regarding both their psychometric (precision and efficiency) and psychological (anxiety) characteristics. Tests were applied in an actual assessment situation, in which test scores determined 20% of term grades. A sample of 173 high school students participated. Neither differences in posttest anxiety nor ability were obtained. Concerning precision, AS-AT was as precise as CAT, and both revealed more precision than S-AT. It was concluded that AS-AT acted as a CAT concerning precision. Some hints, but not conclusive support, of the psychological similarity between AS-AT and S-AT was also found.

AB  - Although knee and hip replacements are intended to relieve pain and improve function, up to 44% of knee replacement patients and 27% of hip replacement patients report persistent postoperative joint pain. Improving surgical pain management is essential. We conducted a single-site, 3-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted at an orthopedic clinic, among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) of the hip or knee. Mindfulness meditation (MM), hypnotic suggestion (HS), and cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation) were each delivered in a single, 15-minute group session as part of a 2-hour, preoperative education program. Preoperative outcomes-pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, pain medication desire, and anxiety-were measured with numeric rating scales. Postoperative physical functioning at 6-week follow-up was assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function computer adaptive test. Total joint arthroplasty patients were randomized to preoperative MM, HS, or cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (n = 285). Mindfulness meditation and HS led to significantly less preoperative pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and anxiety. Mindfulness meditation also decreased preoperative pain medication desire relative to cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation and increased postoperative physical functioning at 6-week follow-up relative to HS and cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation. Moderation analysis revealed the surgery type did not differentially impact the 3 interventions. Thus, a single session of a simple, scripted MM intervention may be able to immediately decrease TJA patients' preoperative clinical symptomology and improve postoperative physical function. As such, embedding brief MM interventions in surgical care pathways has the potential to improve surgical outcomes for the millions of patients receiving TJA each year.

AB  - Comments on an article by Tony Cacace & Dennis McFarland (see record [rid]2013-34119-003[/rid]). Cacace and McFarland have written an interesting and provoking article on auditory processing. Cacace and McFarland's conclusion, that testing for auditory processing disorders (APD), included testing in other modalities is expressed strongly. The commentator completely agrees with Cacace & McFarland that it is necessary to disentangle, to the degree possible, the effects of cognitive abilities on auditory processing test scores. The use of adaptive test methods, with computer administration, and predefined stopping criteria dependent on test precision, as recommended by Cacace & McFarland, are key tools in constructing reliable tests. The differential test format also deals with the concern raised by Cacace & McFarland about verbal responses affecting test scores. Regarding Cacace & McFarland's suggestion that total computer administration be combined with a forced-choice design, the commentators would caution that there are potential pitfalls in this strategy, when testing is aimed at young children. Cacace and McFarland have stated that spoken responses are the result of complex motor skills. In summary, the commentators are in complete agreement with Cacace & McFarland that APD testing must be done in a manner that minimizes the effects of cognition on test scores.

AB  - Comments on an article by Robert D. Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2014-06810-010[/rid]). To assess anxiety, Gibbons et al. developed an inventory of 431 questions from initial tests in 798 patients. They developed algorithms to select questions that would produce good agreement between answers to a limited set of questions and the answers to all the questions. The Gibbons et al. approach is a truly outstanding contribution to measurement in medicine it is novel and exciting, and it promises to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of diagnosis both in clinical practice and in research. In short, computerized adaptive testing measures might well be adopted into all current research studies addressing depression and anxiety, first because they might add to the detection of crucial signals in such studies, and second because their use would document where and how best to use these measures in clinical practice.

AB  - Tracked the effect of candidate response patterns on a computerized adaptive test. Data were from a certification examination in laboratory science administered in 1992 to 155 candidates, using a computerized adaptive algorithm. The 90-item certification examination was divided into 9 units of 10 items each to track the pattern of initial responses and response alterations on ability estimates and test precision across the 9 test units. The precision of the test was affected most by response alterations during early segments of the test. While candidates generally benefited from altering responses, individual candidates showed different patterns of response alterations across test segments. Test precision was minimally affected, suggesting that the tailoring of computerized adaptive testing is minimally affected by response alterations.

AB  - We investigated the effects of test anxiety on test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) versus conventional fixed item testing (FIT). We hypothesized that tests containing mainly items with medium probabilities of being solved would have negative effects on test performance for testtakers high in test anxiety. A total of 110 students (aged 16 to 20) from a German secondary modern school filled out a short form of the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI-G; Wacker, Jaunzeme, & Jaksztat, 2008) and then were presented with items from the Adaptive Matrices Test (AMT; Hornke, Etzel, & Rettig, 1999) on the computer, either in CAT form or in a fixed item test form with a selection of items arranged in order of increasing item difficulty. Additionally, half of the students were given a short summary of information about the mode of item selection in adaptive testing before working on the CAT. In a moderated regression approach, a significant interaction of test anxiety and test mode was revealed. The effect of test mode on the AMT score was stronger for students with higher scores on test anxiety than for students with lower test anxiety. Furthermore, getting information about CAT led to significantly better results than receiving standard test instructions. Results are discussed with reference to test fairness.

AB  - Background: Measurement instruments that are used for monitoring patients in mental health care are developed according to the principles of classical test theory. Because the assumptions underlying this theory are outdated, this is a good time to work towards a new method of measurement known as computerised adaptive testing (CAT), the method being based on item response theory. Aim: To introduce the CAT-methodology into Dutch mental health care, and provide an overview of the current and desirable developments. Method: We explain what CAT is and why mental health care should warmly welcome this new development. We also outline the limitations of CAT, summarise the developments that have already been made nationally and internationally and consider some developments we think are desirable. Results: PROMIS item banks for anxiety and depression for adults show that CAT is more efficient than instruments currently in use and is able to produce very precise outcomes. Conclusion: The first CATS for anxiety and depression will be available late 2017 or early 2018 for adults receiving mental health care in the Netherlands. Recent results are very impressive and CAT-technology will increase the efficiency of symptom measurements, bringing these measurements to a higher level.

Omdat de aannames achter deze theorie achterhaald zijn, is het tijd om toe te werken naar een nieuwe meetmethode die is gebaseerd op de itemresponstheorie: computergestuurd adaptief testen (CAT). Doel: De CAT-methodiek introduceren bij de Nederlandse ggz, en een overzicht geven van de huidige en toekomstige ontwikkelingen. Methode: We lichten toe wat CAT is, wat de voordelen zijn voor de ggz, wat de beperkingen zijn, welke nationale en internationale ontwikkelingen er al zijn geweest, en welke ontwikkelingen nog wenselijk zijn. Resultaten: De patient-reported outcomes measurement information system(PROMIS)-itembanken voor angst en depressie voor volwassenen illustreren dat het mogelijk is om met CAT effici<c3><ab>nter te meten dan met het klassieke meetinstrumentarium, met zeer precieze uitkomsten. Conclusie: Eind 2017, begin 2018 komen de eerste gevalideerde CAT<e2><80><99>s voor angst en depressie beschikbaar voor volwassenen in de ggz. De huidige resultaten zijn veelbelovend en de CAT-technologie brengt meten in de ggz op een hoger plan. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has received increasing attention over the past few years in educational measurement. Like all other formats of CAT, item replenishment is an essential part of MCAT for its item bank maintenance and management, which governs retiring overexposed or obsolete items over time and replacing them with new ones. Moreover, calibration precision of the new items will directly affect the estimation accuracy of examinees<e2><80><99> ability vectors. In unidimensional CAT (UCAT) and cognitive diagnostic CAT, online calibration techniques have been developed to effectively calibrate new items. However, there has been very little discussion of online calibration in MCAT in the literature. Thus, this paper proposes new online calibration methods for MCAT based upon some popular methods used in UCAT. Three representative methods, Method A, the <e2><80><98>one EM cycle<e2><80><99> method and the <e2><80><98>multiple EM cycles<e2><80><99> method, are generalized to MCAT. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare the three new methods by manipulating three factors (test length, item bank design, and level of correlation between coordinate dimensions). The results showed that all the new methods were able to recover the item parameters accurately, and the adaptive online calibration designs showed some improvements compared to the random design under most conditions.

AB  - Objectives: To develop a paper-and-pencil semi-adaptive test for 5 domains of health-related quality of life (PAT- 5D-QOL) based on item response theory (IRT). Methods: The questionnaire uses items from previously developed item banks for 5 domains: (1) walking, (2) handling objects, (3) daily activities, (4) pain or discomfort, and (5) feelings. For each domain, respondents are initially classified into 4 functional levels. Depending on the level, they are instructed to respond to a different set of 5 additional questions. IRT scores for each domain and overall health utility scores are obtained using a simple spreadsheet. The questions were selected using psychometric and conceptual criteria. The format of the questionnaire was developed through focus groups and cognitive interviews. Feasibility was tested in two population surveys. A simulation study was conducted to compare PAT-5D-QOL with a computerized adaptive test (CAT-5D-QOL) and a fixed questionnaire, developed from the same item banks, in terms of accuracy, bias, precision, and ceiling and floor effects. Results: Close to 90 % of the participants in feasibility studies followed the skip instructions properly. In a simulation study, scores on PAT-5D-QOL for all domains tended to be more accurate, more precise, less biased, and less affected by a ceiling effect than scores on a fixed IRT-based questionnaire of the same length. PAT-5D-QOL was slightly inferior to a fully adaptive instrument. Conclusions: PAT-5D-QOL is a novel, semi-adaptive, IRT-based measure of health-related quality of life with a broad range of potential applications.

AB  - Approximately one-fourth of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases are associated with a disruptive genetic variant. Many of these ASD genotypes have been described previously, and are characterized by unique constellations of medical, psychiatric, developmental, and behavioral features. Development of precision medicine care for affected individuals has been challenging due to the phenotypic heterogeneity that exists even within each genetic subtype. In the present study, we identify developmental milestones that predict cognitive and adaptive outcomes for five of the most common ASD genotypes. Sixty-five youth with a known pathogenic variant involving ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A genes participated in cognitive and adaptive testing. Exploratory linear regressions were used to identify developmental milestones that predicted cognitive and adaptive outcomes within each gene group. We hypothesized that the earliest and most predictive milestones would vary across gene groups, but would be consistent across outcomes within each genetic subtype. Within the ADNP group, age of walking predicted cognitive outcomes, while age of first words predicted adaptive behaviors. Age of phrases predicted adaptive functioning in the CHD8 group, but cognitive outcomes were not clearly associated with early developmental milestones. Verbal milestones were the strongest predictors of cognitive and adaptive outcomes for individuals with mutations to DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A. These trends inform decisions about treatment planning and long-term expectations for affected individuals, and they add to the growing body of research linking molecular genetic function to brain development and phenotypic outcomes. LAY SUMMARY: Researchers have found many genetic causes of autism including mutations to ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, and SCN2A genes. We found that each genetic cause had different early developmental milestones that explained the overall functioning of the children when they were older. Depending on the genetic cause, the age that a child first starts walking and/or talking may help to better understand and support a child's development who has a mutation to one of the above genes.

AB  - Item banks are typically constructed from responses to items that are presented in one fixed order; therefore, order effects between subsequent items may violate the independence assumption. We investigated the effect of item order on item bank construction, item calibration, and ability estimation. 15 polytomous items similar to items used in a pilot version of a computer adaptive test for anxiety (Walter et al., 2005; Walter et al., 2007) were presented in one fixed order or in a order randomly generated for each respondent. A total of n = 520 out-patients participated in the study. Item calibration (Generalized Partial Credit Model) yielded only small differences of slope and location parameters. Simulated test runs using either the full item bank or an adaptive algorithm produced very similar ability estimates (expected a posteriori estimation). These results indicate that item order had little impact on item calibration and ability estimation for this item set. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since the early work on Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), a positive effect of CAT on participants<e2><80><99> test taking motivation has been widely accepted. However, in recent publications this assumption is frequently criticized and a negative effect is stated. To bring light to the controversy, the effect of adaptive testing with the Frankfurt Adaptive Concentration Test (FACT, Moosbrugger & Heyden, 1997) on test-taking motivation was examined experimentally (N = 79). Two independent samples received the FACT either in an adaptive or a non-adaptive version. Test-taking motivation was significantly lower in the adaptive condition than in the non-adaptive condition, p = .045, <ce><b7><c2><b2> = .051. Further analyses showed that the differences in test-taking motivation between the adaptive und the non-adaptive condition are mainly due to the perceived probability of success and not to other motivational components like the perceived probability of failure or the perceived challenge.

AB  - Background: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) based on Item Response Theory, (IRT) offers an efficient way for accurate measurement of patient reported outcomes. The efficiency lies within a minimal response burden and a high measurement precision over a broad measurement range. The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the responsiveness of CATs measuring anxiety, depression, and stress reaction to standard static self-assessment tools. Methods: Longitudinal data of n = 595 psychosomatic inpatients were analyzed for evaluating retest-reliability and sensitivity to change of the CATs compared to static measures (GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PSQ) using correlational and ANOVA statistics. The study hypothesized that CATs are at least as retest-reliable and as sensitive to change as static tools. Results: The three CATs show a low burden for patients, administering on average 5<e2><80><93>7 (<c2><b1>2<e2><80><93>6SD) items with similar retest-reliability compared to the static tools applied (A-CAT: r = .78 vs. GAD-7: r = .75, D-CAT: r = .71 vs. PHQ-9: r = .75, S-CAT: r = .80 vs. PSQ worries scale: r = .80). The CATs were overall as sensitive to change as the static tools (Cohen's d ranged between .19 and .69). Limitations: This is a monocenter, observational, longitudinal study without external clinical criteria; thus generalization to other settings may be limited. Conclusions: The tested CATs belong to the first generation of CATs being used in daily routine for more than a decade. They are as retest reliable and sensitive to change as static tools. Newer CATs may provide further practical advantages. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: We describe a three-phase implementation of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Depression and Anxiety Standard Set in a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry practice. Methods: During the preintervention phase, we reviewed patient-reported outcome tools and engaged stakeholders and leadership. During phase 1, the standard set was converted into an electronic previsit intake assessment that was implemented in a physician champion's practice. Patients completed the intake on a tablet, and computer adaptive testing was used to reduce response burden. Physician-facing data display facilitated use during subsequent in-person visits. An electronic version of the follow-up standard set was used during follow-up visits. During phase 2, a second physician tested scalability and the intervention was disseminated department wide in phase 3. Results: During phase 1, 186 intakes and 67 follow-up electronic patient-reported outcome sets were completed. Average patient age was 54 years, and 44% were male. On average, patients ranked the tool 4.4 out of 5 and spent 22 minutes completing the intake. Time-driven activity-based costing found the new process to be cost-effective. During phase 2, 386 patients completed electronic patient-reported outcome sets, with 315 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the tool as 4.0 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes completing the questions. During phase 3, 2166 patients completed intake electronic patient-reported outcome sets and 1249 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the tool 4.3 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes on it. Scores and completion time did not differ greatly between phases. Conclusions: Integration of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Depression and Anxiety Standard Set is feasible. Future research comparing International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement set with other approaches and in different settings is needed.

AB  - Existing sets of social and emotional stimuli suitable for social cognition research are limited in many ways, including size, unimodal stimulus delivery, and restriction to major universal emotions. Existing measures of social cognition could be improved by taking advantage of item response theory and adaptive testing technology to develop instruments that obtain more efficient measures of multimodal social cognition. However, for this to be possible, large pools of emotional stimuli must be obtained and validated. We present the development of a large, high-quality multimedia stimulus set produced by professional adult and child actors (ages 5 to 74) containing both visual and vocal emotional expressions. We obtained over 74,000 audiovisual recordings of a wide array of emotional and social behaviors, including the main universal emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise), as well as more complex social expressions (pride, affection, sarcasm, jealousy, and shame). The actors generated a high quantity of technically superior, ecologically valid stimuli that were digitized, archived, and rated for accuracy and intensity of expressions. A subset of these facial and vocal expressions of emotion and social behavior were submitted for quantitative ratings to generate parameters for validity and discriminability. These stimuli are suitable for affective neuroscience-based psychometric tests, functional neuroimaging, and social cognitive rehabilitation programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to develop and validate a suite of dimensional measures of psychiatric syndromes for use in a criminal justice population. METHODS: The previously validated Computerized Adaptive Test-Mental Health (CAT-MH) was administered to a sample of 475 defendants in the Cook County Bond Court. Item-level data were used to determine which test items exhibited differential item functioning in this population compared with the population used for the original calibration. RESULTS: After removal of nine items that exhibited differential item functioning from the CAT-MH, correlations between scores based on the original calibration from a nonjustice-involved population and the newly computed scores based on a sample of bond court defendants showed a correlation coefficient of r=0.96 to r=0.99. CONCLUSIONS: With a slight modification of the original CAT-MH, the tool was successfully used to measure severity of depression, anxiety, mania and/or hypomania, suicidality, and substance use disorder in an English- and Spanish-speaking criminal justice population.

AB  - Investigated the susceptibility to item location effects of 10 item types from the Graduate Record Examination General Test, which was administered to approximately 4,000 examinees in 1 of 2 operational forms, by comparing the item difficulty parameters of sets of items across intended usages to identify location effects as a form of multidimensionality. Results show that 2 of the 10 item types, analysis of explanations and logical diagrams, were clearly affected by item location in the population tested. A common item type, reading comprehension, was affected somewhat by item context. Examples of testing situations where location effects are important are described. It is recommended that these item types not be used in an adaptive testing program without assessing their susceptibility to location effects within the population (and subpopulations) of interest.

AB  - Comments on an article by RD. Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2014-06810-010[/rid]). The Computerized Adaptive Testing<e2><80><93>Anxiety Inventory (CAT-ANX) was introduced as a new 'test for anxiety,' with suggested large-scale screening uses and planned commercial availability. The pool of over 400 items has not been demonstrated to have construct validity or predictive validity. The resultant CAT-ANX was not validated against existing anxiety scales. Test-retest reliability was not demonstrated. The 'anxiety' of CAT-ANX was not defined. It is not coterminous with generalized anxiety disorder, although the article focused on this disorder. Operationally, CAT-ANX draws from many. The data in the article thus provide no sound basis to say that screening with CAT-ANX will allow confident, rapid, and accurate positive identification of key clinical anxiety diagnoses.

AB  - Objective: Physical activity (PA) and sleep are leading health indicators for individuals of all ages. Monitoring young children<e2><80><99>s PA and sleep using psychometrically sound instruments could help facilitate timely interventions to promote healthy development. This article describes the development of the PROMIS<c2><ae> Early Childhood (EC) Parent Report Physical Activity (PA) and Sleep Problems (SP) measures for children aged 1<e2><80><93>5 years. Methods: Item pools were generated by interviewing parents, input from content experts, and literature review. Data from a U.S. general population sample were used to determine factor structures of item pools via factor analytic approaches, estimate item parameters via item response theory (IRT) models, and establish norms. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate across-domain associations. Analysis of variance was used and known-groups<e2><80><99> validity of PA and SP by comparing their scores to PROMIS EC Parent Report Global Health: child<e2><80><99>s physical, emotional, and mental conditions. Results: Initial item pools consisted of 19 and 26 items for PA and SP, respectively. Factor analyses<e2><80><99> results supported unidimensionality of 5 and 16 items measuring PA and SP, respectively, which were then calibrated using IRT. Norms were established by centering to a probability-based U.S. general population. Computerized adaptive testing algorithms were established. Some analyses supported initial measure validity. Conclusions: The PROMIS EC PA calibrated scale and SP item banks are user-friendly and brief, yet produce precise scores. Both measures enable psychometrically sound assessment of PA behavior and sleep problems. Future studies to comprehensively evaluate the validity of these two measures are warranted.

AB  - Working memory tasks designed for children usually present trials in order of ascending difficulty, with testing discontinued when the child fails a particular level. Unfortunately, this procedure comes with a number of issues, such as decreased engagement from high-ability children, vulnerability of the scores to temporary mind-wandering, and large between-subjects variations in number of trials, testing time, and proactive interference. To circumvent these problems, the goal of the present study was to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing working memory using an adaptive testing procedure. The principle of adaptive testing is to dynamically adjust the level of difficulty as the task progresses to match the participant's ability. We used this method to develop an adaptive complex span task (the ACCES) comprising verbal and visuo-spatial subtests. The task presents a fixed number of trials to all participants, allows for partial credit scoring, and can be used with children regardless of ability level. The ACCES demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in a sample of 268 children aged 8<e2><80><93>13 years, confirming the feasibility of using adaptive tasks to measure working memory capacity in children. A free-to-use implementation of the ACCES is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by A. C. de Campos et al. (see record [rid]2020-09950-001[/rid]). Campos et al. investigated the sensorimotor cortical activation during symmetric and asymmetric bimanual tasks in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The main finding of the study suggests greater activation in bilateral sensorimotor cortices in children with unilateral CP compared to age-matched typically developing children. Moreover, the sensorimotor cortical activation was higher during asymmetric versus symmetric tasks. The finding of the study reveals correlation between greater activation within the sensorimotor cortices and synchronized electromyography (EMG) activity of flexor carpi radialis muscle. More synchronized EMG activity during asymmetric tasks potentially indicates reduced selective control of the arm; however, further investigation should consider the severity of hemiplegia and presence or absence of mirror movements, since these factors might significantly affect the correlation. Third, the study results indicate strong correlation between laterality index shifted to non-lesioned hemisphere and better function on the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory computer adaptive test (PEDI-CAT). These results contradict the evidence that collectively shows contra-lesional shift of laterality index as a marker of poor hand function. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is an efficient testing mode, which allows each examinee to answer appropriate items according his or her latent trait level. The implementation of CAT requires a large-scale item pool, and item pool needs to be frequently replenished with new items to ensure test validity and security. Online calibration is a technique to calibrate the parameters of new items in CAT, which seeds new items in the process of answering operational items, and estimates the parameters of new items through the response data of examinees on new items. The most popular estimation methods include one EM cycle method (OEM) and multiple EM cycle method (MEM) under dichotomous item response theory models. This paper extends OEM and MEM to the graded response model (GRM), a popular model for polytomous data with ordered categories. Two simulation studies were carried out to explore online calibration under a variety of conditions, including calibration design, initial item parameter calculation methods, calibration methods, calibration sample size and the number of categories. Results show that the calibration accuracy of new items were acceptable, and which were affected by the interaction of some factors, therefore some conclusions were given.

AB  - Two computerized versions of an English vocabulary test for Spanish speakers (an adaptive and a fixed one) were applied in a Spanish sample of first-year psychology undergraduate students. The effects of test type (computer-adaptive vs computerized-fixed) and review condition (allowed vs not allowed) on several psychological variables were examined. Within subject variables were measured both before and after review to study the effects of review on the psychological and psychometric variables for the review condition in both tests. Two major results were obtained after review: a) a significant increase of correct responses and estimated ability, and b) a decrease of the state-anxiety level. The differences were not significant for measurement error. Interaction effects (test type by moment) were not significant. These and other results concerning the assessment conditions established in this and previous papers are discussed. Finally, the implications that the results may have to establish review conditions in computerized adaptive tests are commented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Item response theory (IRT) provides valuable methods for the analysis of the psychometric properties of a psychological measure. However, IRT has been mainly used for assessing achievements and ability rather than personality factors. This paper presents an application of the IRT to a personality measure. Thus, the psychometric properties of a new emotional adjustment measure that consists of a 28-six graded response items is shown. Classical test theory (CTT) analyses as well as IRT analyses are carried out. Samejima's (1969) graded-response model has been used for estimating item parameters. Results show that the bank of items fulfills model assumptions and fits the data reasonably well, demonstrating the suitability of the IRT models for the description and use of data originating from personality measures. In this sense, the model fulfills the expectations that IRT has undoubted advantages: (1) The invariance of the estimated parameters, (2) the treatment given to the standard error of measurement, and (3) the possibilities offered for the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CAT). The bank of items shows good reliability. It also shows convergent validity compared to the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPQ-A; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) and the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ; Caprara, Barbaranelli, & Borgogni, 1993).

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the psychometric properties (e.g., data distribution characteristics, convergent/discriminant validity, internal consistency reliability, and test administration characteristics) of the spinal cord injury quality of life measurement system (SCI-QOL) Resilience item bank delivered as a computer adaptive test (CAT) in a sample of individuals with chronic pain and spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Descriptive statistics were calculated to investigate variable data distribution characteristics. Correlation analyses were conducted for convergent and discriminant validity. Item response theory-derived reliability was calculated for the SCI-QOL Resilience CAT. RESULT: One hundred thirty-three adults with SCI (N = 133; 73.5% male, 26.5% female) were enrolled. Sample mean T score on the SCI-QOL Resilience measure was 48.40, SD = 8.60 (min = 29.4; max = 70.0). The CAT administered between 4 (most common, 41.4% of cases) and 12 (9% of cases) items with the Mean(#items) = 5.73, SD = 2.45. The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT scores were normally distributed, with very low ceiling (0%) and floor (3%) effects. The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT had a reliability of 0.89, and the mean length of time for respondents to complete the SCI-QOL Resilience CAT was 44.34 s. SCI-QOL Resilience CAT validity was supported by significant moderate correlations with pain acceptance, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, positive affect and well-being, and pain interference (convergent validity) and small non-significant correlations with age, sex, injury level, pain intensity, mobility level, and years since injury (discriminant validity). CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity. The CAT administration characteristics were impressive: With few items (low response burden), the scale achieved good reliability.

AB  - Aim: To describe crosssectional and longitudinal variation in neurorehabilitation content provided to young people after severe paediatric acquired brain injury (pABI) and to relate this to observed functional recovery. Method: This was an observational study in a cohort of admissions to a residential neurorehabilitation centre. Recovery was described using the Pediatric Evaluation of DisabilityComputer Adaptive Testing instrument. Rehabilitation content was measured using the recently described Paediatric Rehabilitation Ingredients Measure (PRISM) and examined using multidimensional scaling. Results: The PRISM reveals wide variation in rehabilitation content between and during admissions primarily reflecting proportions of child active practice, child emotional support, and other management of body structure and function. Rehabilitation content is predicted by preadmission recovery, suggesting therapist decisions in designing rehabilitation programmes are shaped by their initial expectations of recovery. However, significant correlations persist between plausiblyrelated aspects of delivered therapy and observed postadmission recovery after adjusting for such effects. Interpretation: The PRISM approach to the analysis of rehabilitation content shows promise in that it demonstrates significant correlations between plausiblyrelated aspects of delivered therapy and observed recovery that have been hard to identify with other approaches. However, rigorous, causal analysis will be required to truly understand the contributions of rehabilitation to recovery after pABI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book, Computerized Multistage Testing: Theory and Applications by D. Yan, A. A. von Davier, and C. Lewis (2014). This book presents multistage testing (MST), a useful methodology for the design and administration of adaptive tests that exhibits several practical advantages over traditional computerized adaptive testing. The book mirrors the process of developing and implementing an MST from beginning to end. It takes into consideration the decisions that need to be made at each step including the questions that need to be considered in the decision-making process, as well as the various methodologies that exist to implement the MST design chosen. The authors succeed in merging theoretical concepts with the operational and implementation aspects of MST, making the reading fruitful and motivating. The strength of the book is that it addresses the needs of practitioners in the testing industry, while still remaining theoretical enough to be of interest to graduate students and scientific researchers.

AB  - Purpose: Item response theory is increasingly used in the development of psychometric tests. This paper evaluates whether these modern psychometric methods can improve self-reported screening for depression and anxiety in patients with heart failure. Methods: Themental health status of 194 patients with heart failure was assessed using six screening tools for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (9 items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (7 items), PROMIS-Depression Short Form 8a (8 items)) and Anxiety (GAD-7 (7 items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (7 items), PROMIS-Anxiety Short Form 8a (8 items)). An in-person structured clinical interview was used as the current gold standard to identify the presence of a mental disorder. The diagnostic accuracy of all static tools was compared when item response theory (IRT)-based person parameter were estimated instead of sum scores. Furthermore, we compared performance of static instruments with post hoc simulated individual-tailored computer-adaptive test (CATs) for both disorders and a common negative affect CAT. Results: In general, screening for depression was highly efficient and showed a better performance than screening for anxiety with only minimal differences among the assessed instruments. IRT-based person parameters yielded the same diagnostic accuracy as sum scores. CATs showed similar screening performance compared to legacy instruments but required significantly fewer items to identify patients without mental conditions. Ideal cutoffs varied between male and female samples. Conclusions: Overall, the diagnostic performance of all investigated instruments was similar, regardless of the methods being used.However,CATs can individually tailor the test to each patient, thus significantly decreasing the respondent burden for patients with and without mental conditions. Such approach could efficiently increase the acceptability ofmental health screening in clinical practice settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Advances in statistical methods and in computer and Internet technology have provided the opportunity to develop new instruments or adapt existing instruments measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs). This article reviews the National Institutes of Health (NIH) interest in supporting the development and application of these methods, the process for developing an item bank, the special issues and challenges faced in the creation of item banks and computerized-adaptive tests (CATs) measuring key symptom and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains affected by a disease or its treatment, and the importance of NIH's role in encouraging this research field. This commentary raised only a few of the many complicated and challenging issues that will need to be addressed as we move into the electronic age of healthcare delivery systems. While we may find some possible solutions from the field of educational testing where most of these methods were developed and used, an open and continued dialogue will need to take place about the unique issues we face in health outcomes measurement. With public and private sector interaction and close cooperation, we can meet these challenges and explore the benefits of item banks and CATs for improving healthcare delivery in a multi-ethnic society.

AB  - Purpose: Caregivers of service members/veterans (SMVs) encounter a number of barriers when navigating the military health care system. The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to assess potential caregiver frustration with the systems of care and benefits in the United States Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Method: The TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration measure was developed using data from 317 caregivers of SMVs with TBI who completed an item pool comprised of 64 questions pertaining to anger or frustration with accessing military health care services. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the retention of 58 items. Constrained graded response model (GRM) overall fit and item fit analyses and differential item functioning investigations of age and education factors supported the retention of 43 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM item calibration products were used to inform the selection of two 6-item static short forms (TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration-Self; TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration-Person with TBI) and to program the TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration computer adaptive test (CAT). Preliminary data supported the reliability (i.e., internal consistency and test<e2><80><93>retest reliability) as well as the validity (i.e., convergent, discriminant, and known-groups) of the new measure. Conclusions: The new TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration measure can be used to examine caregiver perceptions of and experience with the military health care system, to target improvements. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact and Implications: There is a need for a measure of caregiver-reported concerns with navigating the military health care system. Given that caregivers are an important part of the recovery process for persons with TBI, it is important to evaluate their perception of services that their loved ones may or may not receive. A new measure, the TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration item bank, was developed for this purpose. It includes a long form (43 items), two six-item short forms (a version focused on services for the caregiver and a version focused on services for the person with TBI in the military), and a computer-adaptive test. This measure can assist the military health care system to focus on targeting unmet needs of the caregivers of those with TBI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A State-of-the-Science conference on measurement with disability populations recommended '...the development of cognitive and psychosocial outcome measures, using computer-adaptive testing...that are low in respondent burden and valid across patient populations,' (Clohan et al., 2007, p. 1537). Following this recommendation, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) prioritized the development of measures of cognitive functioning for individuals with disabilities, noting that measures of cognitive functioning 'have not been developed for systemic application in the field of medical rehabilitation. Cognition is both a rehabilitation outcome and a factor related to broader functional and community outcomes for individuals with a wide variety of disabling conditions' (Office of Special Education & Rehabilitation Services, 2009, p. 37193). From this came the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function project (NIH Toolbox) which provides a comprehensive set of cognitive, motor, sensory, and emotional health and function measures for use in clinical, longitudinal, and epidemiological research. The nine papers comprising this special section of Rehabilitation Psychology reflect the sustained collaborative efforts of more than two dozen investigators working at six sites over the past 8 years. They are an initial attempt to validate the NIHTB-CB in disability samples, and they provide initial evidence that the NIHTB-CB can be used with individuals who have TBI, SCI, or stroke. The articles published here reflect the fulfillment of recommendations made during a state-of-the-science conference in 2007. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter describes the development and validation of a system for selecting entry-level computer programmers at a large financial services corporation. An important component of the selection system is a computer adaptive test (CAT). The practical and psychometric reasons for choosing an adaptive testing format are described, the reasoning behind the choices is emphasized, and the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved is discussed. In the selection system, the adaptive test was combined with a biodata form and with a semistructured, behavior-oriented interview to maximize the criterion variance predicted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) A newly commissioned math reasoning ability test was used as the basis for the adaptive test. The chapter includes a discussion of how incumbent computer programmers were used to calibrate the item pool and to conduct a concurrent validity study. Given its intended use, the authors paid particular attention to issues relating to how the content of the test could be kept secure, how an adaptive test might affect applicants' reactions to the organization, and keeping the time needed to complete the test to an acceptable amount while providing examinees with enough time to answer.

AB  - The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System is a collection of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness. The measurement system, under development since 1987, began with the creation of a generic CORE questionnaire called the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). The FACT-G (now in Version 4) is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into four primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. It is appropriate for use with patients with any form of cancer, and extensions of it have been used and validated in other chronic illness condition (e.g., HIV/AIDS; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's disease; rheumatoid arthritis), and in the general population. The FACIT Measurement System now includes over 400 questions, some of which have been translated into more than 45 languages. Assessment of any one patient is tailored so that the most-relevant questions are asked and administration time for any one assessment is usually less than 15 minutes. This is accomplished both by the use of specific subscales for relevant domains of HRQOL, or computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of selected symptoms and functional areas. FACIT questionnaires can be administered by self-report (paper or computer) or interview (face-to-face or telephone). Available scoring, normative data and information on meaningful change now allow one to interpret results in the context of a growing literature base.

AB  - An important aspect of the perceived quality of vocal music is the degree to which the vocalist sings in tune. Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test<e2><80><99>s reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.

AB  - Examined the performance of learners of Japanese from different language backgrounds, using data from a computer-adaptive grammar test developed as a placement tool. The trial pen-and-paper test consisted of 225 multiple-choice items. In Australia, China, Japan, and Korea 1,600 students each completed 50 items. In this study, data are presented from 1,452 native speakers of English, Chinese, and Korean who had studied Japanese for 150<e2><80><93>300 hrs. Item difficulties drawn from the trial testing were found to be quite different for the 3 groups of test-takers. This has implications for the validity of using computer-adaptive tests: When actual test-takers are from a background different from that of the trial population, not only may the test fail to measure such test-takers accurately in that unacceptable percentages of test-takers are found to misfit, but the measures of ability provided for each of the test-takers and their relative rankings may differ according to the set of item difficulties used. This will consequently affect decisions made about individual learners regarding placement or selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Building an adaptive testing system requires the practitioner to blend basic research (Weiss, 1980) with technology and logistics that fit the situations in which the tests will be delivered (Sands, Waters, & McBride, 1997). In this study, we will consider the research needs of an adaptive testing system that has been developed for use in a number of K-12 settings (MAP: Northwest Evaluation Association, 2009). While many of the operational questions associated with the initial development of this system have been described earlier (Kingsbury & Houser, 1993, 1998), this chapter focuses on issues that relate current research findings to ongoing adaptive test development and administration there is a category of questions that need to be answered through research and need to be answered within the context of K-12 education to be meaningful. We will discuss three questions in this chapter. The three questions that will be addressed are as follows: Can a stable vertical measurement scale be established that allows the measurement of student achievement levels and achievement growth between grades and across years? Can we identify students who are not giving full effort on a test, and how can we use the information if we can obtain it? Can we adapt our tests using information aside from the momentary achievement estimate for the student and the psychometric characteristics of the items? We have chosen to focus on these questions because they represent research questions in different states of done-ness. The question of vertical scales has been answered in some settings and the methodology exists to answer it in any setting. The question of student effort has been answered in some settings, but we know less about the processes for using the information. Finally the question of using additional information to adapt our tests has been asked, but it is far from answered. These questions suggest the range and the direction of future research that might be useful for additional development of K-12 adaptive tests.

AB  - Background: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS<c2><ae>) includes five item banks for alcohol use. There are limited data, however, regarding their validity (e.g., convergent validity, responsiveness to change). To provide such data, we conducted a prospective study with 225 outpatients being treated for substance abuse. Methods: Assessments were completed shortly after intake and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. The alcohol item banks were administered as computerized adaptive tests (CATs). Fourteen CATs and one six-item short form were also administered from eight other PROMIS domains to generate a comprehensive health status profile. After modeling treatment outcome for the sample as a whole, correlates of outcome from the PROMIS health status profile were examined. Results: For convergent validity, the largest correlation emerged between the PROMIS alcohol use score and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (r = .79 at intake). Regarding treatment outcome, there were modest changes across the target problem of alcohol use and other domains of the PROMIS health status profile. However, significant heterogeneity was found in initial severity of drinking and in rates of change for both abstinence and severity of drinking during follow-up. This heterogeneity was associated with demographic (e.g., gender) and health-profile (e.g., emotional support, social participation) variables. Conclusions: The results demonstrated the validity of PROMIS CATs, which require only 4<e2><80><93>6 items in each domain. This efficiency makes it feasible to use a comprehensive health status profile within the substance use treatment setting, providing important prognostic information regarding abstinence and severity of drinking.

AB  - Calibrated a German item bank for the computer-adaptive testing (CAT) of emotional functioning (EF) in cancer patients and tested different CAT versions. The methodology for item bank development was derived from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Guidelines for Module Development. They comprise thorough conceptualization and literature search, a multi-level cross-cultural review process, as well as the field testing of the developed item list in a sample of cancer patients. Data were analyzed using classical psychometric methods and item response theory (IRT) as well as real-data CAT simulations. The development procedure yielded 38 cross-culturally reviewed items assessing aspects of anxiety, depression, and general distress. They were tested in 204 cancer patients (mean age 59.3; 50.5% men). Psychometric analyses resulted in an item bank of 23 items with sufficient fit to a unidimensional model of EF and good content coverage. CAT simulations showed that the item bank is productive for CAT measurement and provides precise estimates with a small number of items. The item bank showed sufficient discriminative power, except for patients with very good EF. A severe floor effect indicated that more items would be required at the lower end of the continuum when aiming at assessing minor impairments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a first computerized adaptive test (CAT) for the measurement of stress perception (Stress-CAT), in terms of the two dimensions: exposure to stress and stress reaction. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Item response theory modeling was performed using a two-parameter model (Generalized Partial Credit Model). The evaluation of the Stress-CAT comprised a simulation study and real clinical application. A total of 1,092 psychosomatic patients (N1) were studied. Two hundred simulees (N2) were generated for a simulated response data set. Then the Stress-CAT was given to n=116 inpatients, (N3) together with established stress questionnaires as validity criteria. RESULTS: The final banks included n=38 stress exposure items and n=31 stress reaction items. In the first simulation study, CAT scores could be estimated with a high measurement precision (SE<0.32; rho>0.90) using 7.0+/-2.3 (M+/-SD) stress reaction items and 11.6+/-1.7 stress exposure items. The second simulation study reanalyzed real patients data (N1) and showed an average use of items of 5.6+/-2.1 for the dimension stress reaction and 10.0+/-4.9 for the dimension stress exposure. Convergent validity showed significantly high correlations. CONCLUSIONS: The Stress-CAT is short and precise, potentially lowering the response burden of patients in clinical decision making.

AB  - Speech comprehension counts as a benchmark outcome of cochlear implants (CIs)-disregarding the communicative importance of efficient integration of audiovisual (AV) socio-emotional information. We investigated effects of time-synchronized facial information on vocal emotion recognition (VER). In Experiment 1, 26 CI users and normal-hearing (NH) individuals classified emotions for auditory-only, AV congruent, or AV incongruent utterances. In Experiment 2, we compared crossmodal effects between groups with adaptive testing, calibrating auditory difficulty via voice morphs from emotional caricatures to anti-caricatures. CI users performed lower than NH individuals, and VER was correlated with life quality. Importantly, they showed larger benefits to VER with congruent facial emotional information even at equal auditory-only performance levels, suggesting that their larger crossmodal benefits result from deafness-related compensation rather than degraded acoustic representations. Crucially, vocal caricatures enhanced CI users' VER. Findings advocate AV stimuli during CI rehabilitation and suggest perspectives of caricaturing for both perceptual trainings and sound processor technology.

AB  - Computerized adaptive testing for cognitive diagnosis (CD-CAT) needs to be efficient and responsive in real time to meet practical applications' requirements. For high-dimensional data, the number of categories to be recognized in a test grows exponentially as the number of attributes increases, which can easily cause system reaction time to be too long such that it adversely affects the examinees and thus seriously impacts the measurement efficiency. More importantly, the long-time CPU operations and memory usage of item selection in CD-CAT due to intensive computation are impractical and cannot wholly meet practice needs. This paper proposed two new efficient selection strategies (HIA and CEL) for high-dimensional CD-CAT to address this issue by incorporating the max-marginals from the maximum a posteriori query and integrating the ensemble learning approach into the previous efficient selection methods, respectively. The performance of the proposed selection method was compared with the conventional selection method using simulated and real item pools. The results showed that the proposed methods could significantly improve the measurement efficiency with about 1/2-1/200 of the conventional methods' computation time while retaining similar measurement accuracy. With increasing number of attributes and size of the item pool, the computation time advantage of the proposed methods becomes more significant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures are useful tools to quantify patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment symptoms. Historically used "legacy measures", such as the Scoliosis Research Society-22 revised questionnaire (SRS-22r), are often disease-specific and can be time-intensive. Recently developed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computerized adaptive testing (CAT) measures may reduce administrative burdens and permit more efficient outcome collection within clinic workflows. In an era of medicine where payments are becoming tied to outcomes, we sought to assess the time to completion (TTC) of 8 pediatric PROMIS CAT measures and the SRS-22r in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients presenting to a large, urban tertiary referral hospital were prospectively enrolled into the study. Subjects were first-time survey respondents in various phases and types of treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. In total, 200 patients ranging from 10 to 17 years old completed 8 Pediatric PROMIS CATs and the SRS-22r. PROMIS CATs administered include Physical Activity, Mobility, Anxiety, Depressive symptoms, Peer Relationships, Physical Stress Experiences, Pain Behavior and Pain Interference. TTC was calculated using start and stop timestamps in the REDCap software. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) TTC for each PROMIS CAT was 1.1 (+/-0.9) minutes with physical activity, mobility, anxiety, depressive symptoms, peer relationships, physical stress experiences, pain behavior, and pain interference taking 1.2, 1.4, 1.0, 0.9, 1.2, 1.0, 1.0, and 1.2 minutes on average to complete, respectively. Mean TTC for the SRS-22r was 5.2 (+/-3.0) minutes. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric orthopaedic cohort, completion of 8 PROMIS CATs demonstrated minimal test-taker burden and time required for completion. These findings support rapid and easily integrable PROMIS CATs in clinical practice to aid in increased delivery of efficient, patient-centered care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Detecting anxiety in oncology patients is important, requiring valid yet brief measures. One increasingly popular approach is the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS); however, its validity is not well established in oncology. We assessed the convergent and criterion validity of PROMIS anxiety measures in an oncology sample. METHODS: 132 oncology/haematology outpatients completed the PROMIS Anxiety Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-A-CAT) and the 7 item (original) PROMIS Anxiety Short Form (PROMIS-A-SF) along with six well-established measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A); Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Anxiety (DASS-A) and Stress (DASS-S); Distress Thermometer (DT) and PSYCH-6. Correlations, area under the curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with Structured Clinical Interview as the reference standard. RESULTS: Both PROMIS measures correlated with all legacy measures at p < .001 (Rho = .56-.83). AUCs (> .80) were good for both PROMIS measures and comparable to or better than all legacy measures. At the recommended mild cut-point (55), PROMIS-A-SF had sensitivity (.67) comparable to or better than all the legacy measures, whereas PROMIS-A-CAT sensitivity (.59) was lower than GAD-7 (.67) and HADS-A (.62), but comparable to PSYCH-6 and higher than DASS-A, DASS-S and DT. Sensitivity for both was .79. A reduced cut-point of 51 on both PROMIS measures improved sensitivity (.83-.84) although specificity was only adequate (.61-.62). CONCLUSIONS: The convergent and criterion validity of the PROMIS anxiety measures in cancer populations was confirmed as equivalent, but not superior to, established measures (GAD-7 and HADS-A). The PROMIS-A-CAT did not demonstrate clear advantages over PROMIS-A-SF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcome measures, especially Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, has increased in recent years. Given this growth, it is imperative to ensure that the measures being used are validated for the intended population(s)/disease(s). Our objective was to assess the construct validity of 8 PROMIS computer adaptive testing (CAT) measures among children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 200 children (aged 10 to 17 y) with AIS, who completed 8 PROMIS CATs (Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Mobility, Pain Behavior, Pain Interference, Peer Relationships, Physical Activity, Physical Stress Experiences) and the Scoliosis Research Society-22r questionnaire (SRS-22r) electronically. Treatment categories were observation, bracing, indicated for surgery, or postoperative from posterior spinal fusion. Construct validity was evaluated using known group analysis and convergent and discriminant validity analyses. Analysis of variance was used to identify differences in PROMIS T -scores by treatment category (known groups). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient ( rs ) was calculated between corresponding PROMIS and SRS-22r domains (convergent) and between unrelated PROMIS domains (discriminant). Floor/ceiling effects were calculated. RESULTS: Among treatment categories, significant differences were found in PROMIS Mobility, Pain Behavior, Pain Interference, and Physical Stress Experiences and in all SRS-22r domains ( P <0.05) except Mental Health ( P =0.15). SRS-22r Pain was strongly correlated with PROMIS Pain Interference ( rs =-0.72) and Pain Behavior ( rs =-0.71) and moderately correlated with Physical Stress Experiences ( rs =-0.57). SRS-22r Mental Health was strongly correlated with PROMIS Depressive Symptoms ( rs =-0.72) and moderately correlated with Anxiety ( rs =-0.62). SRS-22r Function was moderately correlated with PROMIS Mobility ( rs =0.64) and weakly correlated with Physical Activity ( rs =0.34). SRS-22r Self-Image was weakly correlated with PROMIS Peer Relationships ( rs =0.33). All unrelated PROMIS CATs were weakly correlated (| rs |<0.40). PROMIS Anxiety, Mobility, Pain Behavior, and Pain Interference and SRS-22r Function, Pain, and Satisfaction displayed ceiling effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the construct validity of 6 PROMIS CATs in evaluating AIS patients. Ceiling effects should be considered when using specific PROMIS CATs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) have been suggested for use in measuring treatment effectiveness. To minimize patient burden, two approaches have been proposed: An orthopedic-specific Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) or computer adaptive testing methods such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). The goal of this work was to examine the constructs measured by the SANE and PROMIS system in a military orthopedic population undergoing knee surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 732 patients and 2,166 complete observations, the SANE-Knee PRO and PROMIS surveys for Depression, Anxiety, Pain Interference, Sleep Disturbance, and Physical Function were obtained. A correlation matrix between the PROs was calculated, the number of latent factors to extract was determined via parallel plot, and the final principal axis exploratory factor analysis was performed. RESULTS: The parallel plot analysis indicated that two latent factors existed. One latent factor corresponded to measures of psychological distress (PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, Depression, and Anxiety) and the second latent factor corresponded to physical capability (SANE, PROMIS Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Sleep Disturbance). Both PROMIS Physical Function (0.83) and Pain Interference (-0.80) more strongly weigh on the physical capability latent factor than SANE (0.69). CONCLUSIONS: In a knee surgical population, the SANE, PROMIS Physical Function, and PROMIS Pain Interference measure the same human dimension of physical capability; however, PROMIS Physical Function and Pain Interference may measure this construct more effectively in isolation. The SANE may be a more viable option to gauge physical capability when computer adaptive testing is not possible.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity and reliability of the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Item Bank Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-SD CAT) in patients on renal replacement therapy, using the Insomnia Severity Index as the primary legacy instrument. METHODS: Cross-sectional sample of adults on renal replacement therapy completed PROMIS-SD CAT, Insomnia Severity Index, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised Renal, SF-12 questionnaires. Construct validity was confirmed by associations with legacy instrument scores and measures of emotional wellbeing. Test-retest and scale reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient and standard errors of measurement, respectively. Discrimination was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 217 participants (133 kidney transplant recipients, 84 on dialysis), 15% had moderate/severe sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index >/=15). PROMIS-SD CAT exhibited good test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (0.83-0.93)) and scale (>0.9 for T-scores 34-73) reliability. PROMIS-SD CAT T-scores were strongly correlated with Insomnia Severity Index (rho = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.81-0.88)), Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised Renal Sleep Item (rho = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (0.69-0.81)) and moderately with General Anxiety Disorder-7 scores and SF-12 Mental Component Summary scores (p < 0.001 for all). PROMIS-SD CAT demonstrated outstanding discrimination for moderate/severe insomnia (defined as Insomnia Severity Index >/=15) (AUROC 0.93, 95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.98)). PROMIS-SD CAT and Insomnia Severity Index measurement characteristics were qualitatively similar between patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. CONCLUSIONS: These results support PROMIS-SD CAT's validity and reliability for research and as potential screening tool among patients on renal replacement therapy.

AB  - AIMS: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) has demonstrated faster administration, lower burden of data capture and reduced floor and ceiling effects compared to traditional Patient Reported Outcomes Measurements (PROMs). We investigated the suitability of PROMIS Mobility score in assessing physical function in the sequelae of childhood hip disease. METHODS: In all, 266 adolscents (aged >/= 12 years) and adults were identified with a prior diagnosis of childhood hip disease (either Perthes' disease (n = 232 (87.2%)) or Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (n = 34 (12.8%)) with a mean age of 27.73 years (SD 12.24). Participants completed the PROMIS Mobility Computer Adaptive Test, the Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire, and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. We investigated the correlation between the PROMIS Mobility and other tools to assess use in this population and any clustering of outcome scores. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the PROMIS Mobility and other established PROMs; NAHS (r(s) = 0.79; p < 0.001). There was notable clustering in PROMIS at the upper end of the distribution score (42.5%), with less seen in the NAHS (20.3%). However, the clustering was broadly similar between PROMIS Mobility and the comparable domains of the NAHS; function (53.6%), and activity (35.0%). CONCLUSION: PROMIS Mobility strongly correlated with other tools demonstrating convergent construct validity. There was clustering of physical function scores at the upper end of the distributions, which may reflect truncation of the data caused by participants having excellent outcomes. There were elements of disease not captured within PROMIS Mobility alone, and difficulties in differentiating those with the highest levels of function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social deprivation negatively affects a myriad of physical and behavioral health outcomes. Several measures of social deprivation exist, but it is unclear which measure is best suited to describe patients with orthopaedic conditions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which measure of social deprivation, defined as "limited access to society's resources due to poverty, discrimination, or other disadvantage," is most strongly and consistently correlated with patient-reported physical and behavioral health in patients with orthopaedic conditions? (2) Compared with the use of a single measure alone, how much more variability in patient-reported health does the simultaneous use of multiple social deprivation measures capture? METHODS: Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 79,818 new patient evaluations occurred within the orthopaedic department of a single, large, urban, tertiary-care academic center. Over that period, standardized collection of patient-reported health measures (as described by the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]) was implemented in a staged fashion throughout the department. We excluded the 25% (19,926) of patient encounters that did not have associated PROMIS measures reported, which left 75% (59,892) of patient encounters available for analysis in this cross-sectional study of existing medical records. Five markers of social deprivation were collected for each patient: national and state Area Deprivation Index, Medically Underserved Area Status, Rural-Urban Commuting Area code, and insurance classification (private, Medicare, Medicaid, or other). Patient-reported physical and behavioral health was measured via PROMIS computer adaptive test domains, which patients completed as part of standard care before being evaluated by a provider. Adults completed the PROMIS Physical Function version 1.2 or version 2.0, Pain Interference version 1.1, Anxiety version 1.0, and Depression version 1.0. Children ages 5 to 17 years completed the PROMIS Pediatric Mobility version 1.0 or version 2.0, Pain Interference version 1.0 or version 2.0, Upper Extremity version 1.0, and Peer Relationships version 1.0. Age-adjusted partial Pearson correlation coefficients were determined for each social deprivation measure and PROMIS domain. Coefficients of at least 0.1 were considered clinically meaningful for this purpose. Additionally, to determine the percentage of PROMIS score variability that could be attributed to each social deprivation measure, an age-adjusted hierarchical regression analysis was performed for each PROMIS domain, in which social deprivation measures were sequentially added as independent variables. The model coefficients of determination (r2) were compared as social deprivation measures were incrementally added. Improvement of the r2 by at least 10% was considered clinically meaningful. RESULTS: Insurance classification was the social deprivation measure with the largest (absolute value) age-adjusted correlation coefficient for all adult and pediatric PROMIS physical and behavioral health domains (adults: correlation coefficient 0.40 to 0.43 [95% CI 0.39 to 0.44]; pediatrics: correlation coefficient 0.10 to 0.19 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.21]), followed by national Area Deprivation Index (adults: correlation coefficient 0.18 to 0.22 [95% CI 0.17 to 0.23]; pediatrics: correlation coefficient 0.08 to 0.15 [95% CI 0.06 to 0.17]), followed closely by state Area Deprivation Index. The Medically Underserved Area Status and Rural-Urban Commuting Area code each had correlation coefficients of 0.1 or larger for some PROMIS domains but neither had consistently stronger correlation coefficients than the other. Except for the PROMIS Pediatric Upper Extremity domain, consideration of insurance classification and the national Area Deprivation Index together explained more of the variation in age-adjusted PROMIS scores than the use of insurance classification alone (adults: r2 improvement 32% to 189% [95% CI 0.02 to 0.04]; pediatrics: r2 improvement 56% to 110% [95% CI 0.01 to 0.02]). The addition of the Medically Underserved Area Status, Rural-Urban Commuting Area code, and/or state Area Deprivation Index did not further improve the r2 for any of the PROMIS domains. CONCLUSION: To capture the most variability due to social deprivation in orthopaedic patients' self-reported physical and behavioral health, insurance classification (categorized as private, Medicare, Medicaid, or other) and national Area Deprivation Index should be included in statistical analyses. If only one measure of social deprivation is preferred, insurance classification or national Area Deprivation Index are reasonable options. Insurance classification may be more readily available, but the national Area Deprivation Index stratifies patients across a wider distribution of values. When conducting clinical outcomes research with social deprivation as a relevant covariate, we encourage researchers to consider accounting for insurance classification and/or national Area Deprivation Index, both of which are freely available and can be obtained from data that are typically collected during routine clinical care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There remains a paucity of information analyzing which factors most influence preoperative expectations for patients undergoing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). The purposes of our study were to characterize preoperative patient expectations for those scheduled to undergo RTSA and to determine the impact of demographic factors, shoulder function, and shoulder pain on these preoperative expectations. METHODS: Patients were prospectively recruited into the study if they were scheduled to undergo an elective unilateral primary RTSA for a diagnosis of glenohumeral arthritis. Preoperative patient expectations were evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery's Shoulder Surgery Expectation Survey. Patients also completed the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function-Upper Extremity computer adaptive test (version 2.0), the PROMIS Pain Interference (PI) computer adaptive test (version 1.1), the PROMIS Depression computer adaptive test (version 1.0), visual analog scores, and an itemized satisfaction questionnaire, which paralleled the Hospital for Special Surgery's Shoulder Surgery Expectation Survey. Demographic data and preoperative shoulder range of motion (ROM) were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients scheduled to undergo RTSA were included in the study. Relief of daytime pain (n = 91, 85%), improvement in self-care (n = 86, 80%), and improvement in shoulder ROM (n = 85, 79%) were most commonly cited as "very important" expectations. In the item-specific analysis, lower PROMIS Upper Extremity scores were correlated with greater expectations for the ability to reach sideways (P = .015) and the ability to perform daily activities (P = .018). Patients with lower shoulder ROM had greater expectations for improved shoulder ROM (internal rotation with arm at 90 degrees , P = .004) and an improved ability to perform daily activities (forward elevation, P = .038; abduction, P = .009). In the cumulative analysis, a greater number of very important expectations was associated with African American race (P = .013), higher PROMIS PI score (r = 0.351, P = .004), and lower overall preoperative satisfaction (r = 0.334, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients scheduled to undergo RTSA have the greatest expectations for relief of daytime pain, improvement in self-care, and improvement in shoulder ROM. Patients with limited preoperative ROM have greater expectations for improvement in self-care and the ability to perform daily activities in addition to expectations for improvement in shoulder ROM. Greater overall expectations for surgery were not associated with preoperative physical function but were instead associated with lower preoperative satisfaction and higher PROMIS PI scores.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhythms And You (RAY) is an online intervention for bipolar disorders (BD) based on Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy. We examined RAY's feasibility and acceptability for individuals with BD recruited from primary care. Because online interventions may be more effective when paired with human support, we evaluated RAY with and without weekly brief ( approximately 5 min) calls from clinical helpers (CH). METHODS: Participants (n = 47) meeting criteria for BD I, II or other specified BD, presenting for primary care, were randomly assigned to RAY, RAY-CH, or Adjunctive Reading Material (ARM) control. RAY consisted of 12 weekly online modules. ARM consisted of 12 weekly emails. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: RAY showed high completion rates and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire scores (36/47, 77% and 25.1 +/- 5.5, respectively; no group differences). Effect sizes for RAY- CH ranged from small [Internal State Scale-Activation Subscale (ISS-ACT); d = 0.3] to large [SF-12 Mental Health Composite Score (SF-12 MHC); d = 1.3]. ARM also showed moderate effects (ISS-ACT d = 0.7; Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, d = 0.8). SF-12 MHC scores showed a time*group interaction (F = 2.38, df = 6,32, p = 0.05) favoring RAY-CH. Number of logins trended toward significant association with improved social rhythm regularity (F = 4.09, df = 1, 17, p = 0.06). LIMITATIONS: Sample size is small, limiting conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Remote delivery of RAY for individuals with BD is feasible and acceptable. More time spent engaged in RAY was associated with greater improvement in social rhythm regularity. Preliminary evidence suggests adding brief human support to RAY may yield better outcomes.

AB  - AIMS: Patient-reported outcome measures have become an important part of routine care. The aim of this study was to determine if Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures can be used to create patient subgroups for individuals seeking orthopaedic care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients from Duke University Department of Orthopaedic Surgery clinics (14 ambulatory and four hospital-based). There were two separate cohorts recruited by convenience sampling (i.e. patients were included in the analysis only if they completed PROMIS measures during a new patient visit). Cohort #1 (n = 12,141; December 2017 to December 2018,) included PROMIS short forms for eight domains (Physical Function, Pain Interference, Pain Intensity, Depression, Anxiety, Sleep Quality, Participation in Social Roles, and Fatigue) and Cohort #2 (n = 4,638; January 2019 to August 2019) included PROMIS Computer Adaptive Testing instruments for four domains (Physical Function, Pain Interference, Depression, and Sleep Quality). Cluster analysis (K-means method) empirically derived subgroups and subgroup differences in clinical and sociodemographic factors were identified with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Cluster analysis yielded four subgroups with similar clinical characteristics in Cohort #1 and #2. The subgroups were: 1) Normal Function: within normal limits in Physical Function, Pain Interference, Depression, and Sleep Quality; 2) Mild Impairment: mild deficits in Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Sleep Quality but with Depression within normal limits; 3) Impaired Function, Not Distressed: moderate deficits in Physical Function and Pain Interference, but within normal limits for Depression and Sleep Quality; and 4) Impaired Function, Distressed: moderate (Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Sleep Quality) and mild (Depression) deficits. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest orthopaedic patient subgroups differing in physical function, pain, and psychosocial distress can be created from as few as four different PROMIS measures. Longitudinal research is necessary to determine whether these subgroups have prognostic validity. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(7):493-502.

AB  - Computer-adaptive tests use respondents' answers to previous questions to select the subsequent questions. They are gaining popularity for their increased measurement precision and decreased administration time compared to static questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to estimate the test-retest reliability and construct validity of the computer-adaptive test version of a participation measure, the Late Life Disability Instrument (LLDI-CAT) for people with COPD and to compare scores and administration time with those of the static LLDI. Among 76 older adults with COPD, scores on the LLDI-CAT were compared to scores on measures of related constructs, between groups based on symptom severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype, and to scores on the static LLDI. A subsample of 28 people completed the LLDI-CAT a second time within one week of the initial administration for test-retest reliability. The LLDI-CAT had very good test-retest reliability (ICC(2,1) 0.88; SEM 2.74 points), fair correlations with physical function (r = 0.37-0.50), anxiety (r=-0.42), and depression (r=-0.50), fair to moderately-strong correlations with quality of life (r = 0.48-0.63), and strong correlation with the static LLDI limitation domain (r = 0.80). The LLDI-CAT scores differed between people with different symptom severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype (p </= 0.004). The mean administration time for the LLDI-CAT was 3.3 (1.5) minutes, less than that of the static LLDI at 6.3 (2.8) minutes (p < 0.001). The LLDI-CAT demonstrates evidence of test-retest reliability and construct validity, and correlates well with the limitation domain of the static LLDI for people with COPD. The LLDI-CAT can be used to assess participation for this population.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to validate the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric item banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a, and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in a general Dutch population and to provide reference data. METHODS: Participants (N = 2,893, aged 8-18), recruited by two internet survey providers, completed both item banks. These item banks were assessed on unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity, Graded Response Model (GRM) item fit, and differential item functioning (DIF) for gender, age group, region, ethnicity, and language. The short forms and CATs were assessed on reliability and construct validity compared to the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale short version (RCADS-22) subscales. Reference scores were calculated. RESULTS: Both item banks showed sufficient unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity, and GRM item fit, except for three Depressive Symptoms items that showed insufficient GRM item fit. No DIF was found when using ordinal regression analyses, except for two Depressive Symptoms items that showed DIF for language; all items showed DIF for language when using IRT PRO, except for one Anxiety item. Both short forms and CATs revealed sufficient reliability for moderate and severe levels of anxiety and depression, as well as high positive correlations with corresponding RCADS-22 subscales and slightly lower correlations with non-corresponding RCADS-22 subscales. CONCLUSION: The Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric item banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a and CATs are useful to assess and monitor anxiety and depression in a general population. Reference data are presented.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe functional and skeletal muscle changes observed during pediatric critical illness and recovery and their association with health-related quality of life. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single multidisciplinary PICU. PATIENTS: Children with greater than or equal to 1 organ dysfunction, expected PICU stay greater than or equal to 48 hours, expected survival to discharge, and without progressive neuromuscular disease or malignancies were followed from admission to approximately 6.7 months postdischarge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional status was measured using the Functional Status Scale score and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test. Patient and parental health-related quality of life were measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and Short Form-36 questionnaires, respectively. Quadriceps muscle size, echogenicity, and fat thickness were measured using ultrasonography during PICU stay, at hospital discharge, and follow-up. Factors affecting change in muscle were explored. Associations between functional, muscle, and health-related quality of life changes were compared using regression analysis. Seventy-three survivors were recruited, of which 44 completed follow-ups. Functional impairment persisted in four of 44 (9.1%) at 6.7 months (interquartile range, 6-7.7 mo) after discharge. Muscle size decreased during PICU stay and was associated with inadequate energy intake (adjusted beta, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.28; p = 0.030). No change in echogenicity or fat thickness was observed. Muscle growth postdischarge correlated with mobility function scores (adjusted beta, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09; p = 0.046). Improvements in mobility scores were associated with improved physical health-related quality of life at follow-up (adjusted beta, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.23-1.81; p = 0.013). Child physical health-related quality of life at hospital discharge was associated with parental physical health-related quality of life (adjusted beta, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.17; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle decreased in critically ill children, which was associated with energy inadequacy and impaired muscle growth postdischarge. Muscle changes correlated with change in mobility, which was associated with child health-related quality of life. Mobility, child health-related quality of life, and parental health-related quality of life appeared to be interlinked.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of refractive error-specific quality of life (QoL) item banks and assess their performance using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) simulations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study a 392-item questionnaire, grouped under 11 QoL domains, was interviewer-administered to 305 people with refractive error [mean age +/- S.D., 30.5 +/- 14.1 (range (18 to 83) years; male, 50.5%; mean +/- S.D. spherical equivalent refractive error -2.4 +/- 2.9 (range: -15.0 to +11.0) Dioptres; spectacles (n = 257), contact lens (n = 37), refractive surgery (n = 25), uncorrected refractive error (n = 57)]. Rasch analysis was conducted on each QoL domain using the Andrich rating scale model to investigate parameters including response category functioning, person- and item-reliability, infit and outfit statistics, unidimensionality, targeting, differential item functioning and local item dependency. The resulting item banks underwent CAT simulations in 1,000 cases with 'high' and 'moderate' precision stopping rules. RESULTS: Rasch analysis iterations resulted in 13 refractive error-specific item banks (Convenience, Health concerns, Economic, Activity limitation, Mobility, Emotional, Social, Visual symptoms frequency, Visual symptoms severity, Visual symptoms bothersome, Comfort symptoms frequency, Comfort symptoms severity and Comfort symptoms bothersome), containing a total of 366 items. The item banks had good psychometric properties including satisfactory measurement precision, infit and outfit statistics and unidimensionality. In CAT simulations, the mean number of items required to achieve high and moderate measurement precision was 9.4 and 4.7, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, refractive error-specific QoL item banks show promise in their ability to comprehensively and precisely evaluate a range of quality of life parameters. These items banks when administered using a CAT system offer unique outcome tools for implementation in clinical trials, healthcare and research.

AB  - PURPOSE: To calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Computer Adaptive Test (UE CAT) and Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) for ligament reconstruction tendon interposition (LRTI) patients. METHODS: Adult patients treated with LRTI for trapeziometacarpal OA by fellowship-trained hand surgeons between December 2014 and February 2018 at an academic tertiary institution were included. Outcomes were prospectively collected at each visit by tablet computer, including the QuickDASH, PROMIS UE, Pain Interference, Depression, and Anxiety CATs. Inclusion required a response to the anchor question "How much relief and/or improvement do you feel you have experienced as a result of your treatment?" on a 6-option Likert scale, as well as preoperative (</=120 days before surgery) and follow-up (2-26 weeks) outcomes. We calculated MCID both by an anchor-based approach using the mean score of the minimal change group, and with the 0.5 SD method. RESULTS: Of 145 included participants, mean age was 63 +/- 8 years and 74% were female. Anchor-based MCID estimates for the total cohort were 4.2 for the PROMIS UE CAT and 8.8 for the QuickDASH. The MCID estimates using the 0.5 SD method were 4.8 and 11.7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We propose MCID values of 4.2 to 4.8 for the PROMIS UE CAT and 8.8 to 11.7 for the QuickDASH when powering clinical studies or when assessing improvement among a cohort of patients who have undergone LRTI surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Minimal clinically important difference estimates are helpful when interpreting clinical outcomes after LRTI and for powering prospective trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our primary purpose was to evaluate the reliability of telephone administration of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity (UE) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) version 2.0 in a hand and upper extremity population, and secondarily to make comparisons with the abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH). METHODS: Patients more than 1 year out from hand surgeries performed at a single tertiary institution were enrolled. Half of the patients completed telephone PROMIS UE CAT and QuickDASH surveys first, followed by computer-based surveys 1 to 10 days later, and the other half completed them in the reverse order. Telephone surveys were readministered 2 to 6 weeks later to evaluate test-retest reliability. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) were used to assess agreement between telephone and computer-based scores, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability. The proportion of patients with discrepancies in follow-up scores that exceeded estimates of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was evaluated. RESULTS: For the 89 enrolled patients, the PROMIS UE CAT CCC was 0.82 (83% confidence interval [83% CI], 0.77-0.86; good), which was significantly lower than 0.92 (83% CI, 0.89-0.94; good to excellent) for the QuickDASH. The PROMIS UE CAT ICC did not differ significantly from the QuickDASH (0.85 and 0.91, respectively). Differences in telephone versus computer scores exceeded 5 points (MCID estimate) for the PROMIS UE CAT in 34% of patients versus 5% of patients exceeding 14 points (MCID estimate) for the QuickDASH. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly better reliability was observed for the QuickDASH than the PROMIS UE CAT when comparing telephone with computer-based score acquisition. Over one-third of patients demonstrated a clinically relevant difference in scores between the telephone and the computer-administered tests. We conclude that the PROMIS UE CAT should only be administered through computer-based methods. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that differences in collection methods for the PROMIS UE CAT may systematically affect the scores obtained, which may erroneously influence the interpretation of postoperative scores for hand surgery patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop the Chinese version of the Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Emotional Distress item bank version 2.0-both conceptually equivalent to the original and relevant in the Chinese culture. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress item bank was translated, following the standard Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) translation methodology, by a translation team. Eight children aged 8-17 years from the general population were cognitively interviewed. RESULTS: Most items were well understood by children, and some revisions were made after the cognitive interviewing based on the suggestions of the interviewees. The Chinese version of the Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress-v2.0 item bank was conceptually and semantically equivalent to the original. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The Chinese version of the Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress item bank is now available for further studies to develop computer adaptive tests (CATs). Future CAT version measures may become a new standard measure for children in the general population and those living with a chronic condition in China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The healthcare industry is shifting its focus from traditional clinical outcome measures to patient satisfaction metrics. This change has caused orthopaedic surgeons to become increasingly interested in factors influencing patient satisfaction, which would allow them to potentially modify these factors in an effort to increase postoperative satisfaction. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with patient satisfaction two weeks following extremity orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Patients completed questionnaires preoperatively to assess demographics, activity, pain, expectations, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing for Physical Function, Pain Interference, Social Satisfaction, Depression, Anxiety, and Fatigue. Two weeks after their operation, patients completed the same questionnaires in addition to an Improvement Survey and Met Expectations. Satisfaction was assessed with the Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: Greater surgical satisfaction two weeks following orthopaedic surgery was associated with higher education, alcohol use, better scores on all PROMIS domains at baseline and two weeks, greater activity levels at baseline and two weeks, less bodily pain at baseline and two weeks, less pain in the surgical site at two weeks, greater met expectations, and greater improvement (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides important information about patient satisfaction two weeks after orthopaedic surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluate efficiency, precision, and validity of RetCAT, which comprises ten diabetic retinopathy (DR) quality of life (QoL) computerized adaptive tests (CATs). METHODS: In this cross-sectional clinical study, 183 English and/or Mandarin-speaking participants with DR (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 56.4 +/- 11.9 years; 38% proliferative DR [worse eye]) were recruited from retinal clinics in Singapore. Participants answered the RetCAT tests (Symptoms, Activity Limitation, Mobility, Emotional, Health Concerns, Social, Convenience, Economic, Driving, and Lighting), which were capped at seven items each, and other questionnaires, and underwent eye tests. Our primary evaluation focused on RetCAT efficiency (i.e. standard error of measurement [SEM] +/- SD achieved and time needed to complete each CAT). Secondary evaluations included an assessment of RetCAT's test precision and validity. RESULTS: Mean SEM across all RetCAT tests was 0.351, ranging from 0.272 +/- 0.130 for Economic to 0.484 +/- 0.130 for Emotional. Four tests (Mobility, Social, Convenience, and Driving) had a high level of measurement error. The median time to take each RetCAT test was 1.79 minutes, ranging from 1.12 (IQR [interquartile range] 1.63) for Driving to 3.28 (IQR 2.52) for Activity Limitation. Test precision was highest for participants at the most impaired end of the spectrum. Most RetCAT tests displayed expected correlations with other scales (convergent/divergent validity) and were sensitive to DR and/or vision impairment severity levels (criterion validity). CONCLUSIONS: RetCAT can provide efficient, precise, and valid measurement of DR-related QoL impact. Future application of RetCAT will employ a stopping rule based on SE rather than number of items to ensure that all tests can detect meaningful differences in person abilities. Responsiveness of RetCAT to treatment interventions must also be determined. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: RetCAT may be useful for measuring the patient-centered impact of DR severity and disease progression and evaluating the effectiveness of new therapies.

AB  - Many genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are associated with multiple, sometimes seemingly unrelated, traits. This motivates multi-trait association analyses, which have successfully identified novel associated loci for many complex diseases. While appealing, most existing methods focus on analyzing a relatively small number of traits, and may yield inflated Type 1 error rates when a large number of traits need to be analyzed jointly. As deep phenotyping data are becoming rapidly available, we develop a novel method, referred to as aMAT (adaptive multi-trait association test), for multi-trait analysis of any number of traits. We applied aMAT to GWAS summary statistics for a set of 58 volumetric imaging derived phenotypes from the UK Biobank. aMAT had a genomic inflation factor of 1.04, indicating the Type 1 error rate was well controlled. More important, aMAT identified 24 distinct risk loci, 13 of which were ignored by standard GWAS. In comparison, the competing methods either had a suspicious genomic inflation factor or identified much fewer risk loci. Finally, four additional sets of traits have been analyzed and provided similar conclusions.

AB  - Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures play an important role in clinical care. Currently, a broad-spectrum, validated PRO measure suitable for all dermatology patients, as part of clinical care, does not exist. Patient-reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMIS) measures track specific domain outcomes across all diseases. To assess the relevance and utility of a computer-adaptive health assessment consisting of three PROMIS domains in routine dermatologic care. This retrospective study evaluated a PROMIS health assessment, consisting of three computer-adaptive test domains (pain interference, anxiety, and depression), administered as part of routine clinical care in three dermatology clinics at an academic medical center. The primary objective was to identify clinically significant associations between high PROMIS domain scores (i.e., t score > 55) and dermatologic disease, as well as change in PROMIS domain scores in response to treatment. The majority of patients who initiated the assessment completed all domains (88.7%). In patients with atopic dermatitis, acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and psoriasis, high PROMIS scores correlated with clinically relevant outcomes, such as severe disease, unsuccessful treatment, uncontrolled disease, and the presence of a mental health condition. PROMIS Pain Interference, anxiety and depression identified patients with severe disease, unsuccessful treatment regimens, poorly-controlled disease, and/or mental health comorbidities for multiple skin conditions. Further utilization of PROMIS domains in routine clinical care will promote patient-centered care and improve quality of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression symptoms are prevalent in the general population, and as many as one in eight patients seeing a hand surgeon may have undiagnosed major depression. It is not clear to what degree lower mood is the consequence or cause of greater symptoms and limitations. If depressive symptoms are a consequence of functional limitations, they might be expected to improve when pathophysiology and impairment are ameliorated. Because surgical treatment is often disease-modifying or salvage, surgery might have a greater impact than nonoperative treatment, which is more often palliative (symptom relieving) than disease-modifying. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) For which hand or wrist conditions are depression symptoms lower after operative compared with nonoperative treatment? (2) Among the subset of patients with the highest depression scores, are depression symptoms lower after operative treatment compared with nonoperative treatment? (3) Among the subset of patients who had nonoperative treatment, are depression symptoms lower after a corticosteroid injection compared with no specific biomedical intervention? METHODS: At an academic orthopaedic department, 4452 patients had a new office visit for carpal tunnel syndrome, benign neoplasm, primary hand osteoarthritis, de Quervain's tendinopathy, or trigger digit. We analyzed the 1652 patients (37%) who had a return visit at least 3 months later for the same diagnosis. Patients completed the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression computerized adaptive test at every office visit (higher scores indicate more depression symptoms) and PROMIS Pain Interference (higher scores indicates greater hindrance in daily life owing to pain). Patients with a return visit were more likely to have surgical treatment and had greater Pain Interference scores at the first visit. Thirteen percent of patients (221 of 1652) had incomplete or missing scores at the initial visit and 33% (550 of 1652) had incomplete or missing scores at the final return visit. We used multiple imputations to account for missing or incomplete data (imputations = 50). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, we compared the mean change in Depression scores between patients treated operatively and those treated nonoperatively, accounting for PROMIS Pain Interference scores at the first visit, age, gender diagnosis, provider, and treatment duration. A post-hoc power analysis demonstrated that the smallest patient cohort (benign lump, n = 176) provided 99% power (alpha = 0.05) with eight predictor variables to detect a change of 2 points in the PROMIS Depression score (minimally important difference = 3.5). RESULTS: After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as pain interference and age, only carpal tunnel release was associated with a slightly greater decrease in depression symptoms compared with nonoperative treatment (regression coefficient [RC] = -3 [95% confidence interval -6 to -1]; p = 0.006). In patients with the highest PROMIS Depression scores for each diagnosis, operative treatment was not associated with an improvement in depression symptoms (carpal tunnel release: RC = 5 [95% CI -7 to 16]; p = 0.44). Moreover, a corticosteroid injection was not associated with fewer depression symptoms than no biomedical treatment (carpal tunnel release: RC = -3 [95% CI -8 to 3]; p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Given that operative treatment of hand pathology is not generally associated with a decrease in depression symptoms, our results support treating comorbid depression as a separate illness rather than as a secondary effect of pain or physical limitations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prospectively study the clinical and developmental profile; hematological profile and the B-12 status using multiple parameters in children with Infantile tremor syndrome (ITS). METHODS: In this observational study (NCT02762682) (July 2015 through December 2016) children (and their mothers) with a clinical diagnosis of ITS were evaluated clinically; and development was assessed by CAPUTE scales. A complete blood count (CBC); peripheral blood smear examination; markers of vitamin B12 status (serum B12, homocysteine, folate); acylcarnitines [using Tandem mass spectrometry (TMS)] and urine methylmalonic acid (MMA) [Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS)] were estimated. A control group of children and their mothers were sampled for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 286 individuals were enrolled for this study. One-hundred-ten children with ITS were screened and 92 (20 with tremors; age 12.7 +/- 5 mo, 61 boys) children and their mothers were enrolled. Fifty-one children and their mothers were enrolled as controls. The median clinical linguistic & auditory milestone-developmental quotient (CLAM-DQ) was 32 (IQR 20.6-45.5) and median cognitive adaptive test-developmental quotient (CAT-DQ) was 36.2 (IQR 18.7-49.0). All babies except 9 (ovo-veg) had vegetarian mothers. Head circumference below 2 SD (WHO standards) was seen in 84% and below 3 SD in 58%. The CBC findings were; Hb- 8.3 +/- 1.6 g/dl, Thrombocytopenia-29 (32%), mean corpuscular volume (MCV)- 92.2 +/- 13.4, MCV- more than 95 fL-38(42%), Red cell distribution width (RDW)- 21.6 +/- 6.5, and macrocytes on peripheral smear in 68%. In 89 (97%) out of 92 children had laboratory features of deficient B12 status. Two-thirds of the mothers also had evidence of B12 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: ITS is, in all likelihood is a consequence of vitamin B12 defeciency. It has a significant impact on head growth and development of affected infants.

AB  - Glaucoma, an irreversible blinding condition affecting 3-4% adults aged above 40 years worldwide, is set to increase with a rapidly aging global population. Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma where the treatment paradigm is focused on managing IOP using medications, laser, or surgery regimens. However, notwithstanding IOP and other clinical parameters, patient-reported outcomes, including daily functioning, emotional well-being, symptoms, mobility, and social life, remain the foremost concerns for people being treated for glaucoma. These outcomes are measured using objective patient-centered outcome measures (PCOMs) and subjective patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Studies using PCOMs have shown that people with glaucoma have several mobility, navigational and coordination challenges; reading and face recognition deficits; and are slower in adapting to multiple real-world situations when compared to healthy controls. Similarly, studies have consistently demonstrated, using PROMs, that glaucoma substantially and negatively impacts on peoples' self-reported visual functioning, mobility, independence, emotional well-being, self-image, and confidence in healthcare, compared to healthy individuals, particularly in those with late-stage disease undergoing a heavy treatment regimen. The patient-centred effectiveness of current glaucoma treatment paradigms is equivocal due to a lack of well-designed randomized controlled trials; short post-treatment follow-up periods; an inappropriate selection or availability of PROMs; and/or an insensitivity of currently available PROMs to monitor changes especially in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage glaucoma. We provide a comprehensive, albeit non-systematic, critique of the psychometric properties, limitations, and recent advances of currently available glaucoma-specific PCOMs and PROMs. Finally, we propose that item banking and computerized adaptive testing methods can address the multiple limitations of paper-pencil PROMs; customize their administration; and have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for people with glaucoma.

AB  - Purpose: We are developing item banks assessing the impact of retinal and vitreoretinal diseases (excluding age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment, covered elsewhere) on quality of life (QoL) for adults. This study outlines the first two phases of the multi-stage process: content development and item evaluation.Methods: We grouped retinal and vitreoretinal diseases into hereditary and acquired. Development of the item banks involved two phases: item identification and item evaluation. The items were extracted from three sources: (1) 17 pre-existing PRO instruments, (2) 4 qualitative studies and (3) 79 semi-structured interviews. Item evaluation involved three stages namely, binning (grouping) and winnowing (reduction), expert panel opinion and cognitive interviews.Results: The item identification phase yielded 1,217 items. After three sessions of binning and winnowing, items were reduced to a minimally representative set (n = 411) across nine QoL domains namely, activity limitation, emotional, social, health concerns, symptoms, economic, mobility, convenience, and coping. The hereditary group had a total of 345 items and the acquired group had a total of 257 items. After 23 cognitive interviews items were amended for hereditary diseases resulting in a final set of 345 items and 3 items were amended for acquired diseases, resulting in a final set of 254 items. Overall across nine domains 189 items were common to hereditary and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.Conclusion: As most of the items were unique to hereditary versus acquired retinal and vitreoretinal disease groups separate item banks are required to capture the QoL impacts for hereditary and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To test the null hypothesis that baseline opioid use is not associated with functional or psychological impairment among new hand surgery clinic patients, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments. METHODS: New adult (>/= 18 years) patient visits to a tertiary academic orthopedic nonshoulder hand and upper extremity clinic between February 2014 and April 2018 were eligible. Collected outcomes include the question, "Are you currently taking narcotic pain medications?", the PROMIS Upper Extremity (UE) computerized adaptive testing (CAT), abbreviated version of the Disorders of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH), PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT, PROMIS Pain Interference (PI) CAT, PROMIS Depression CAT, and PROMIS Anxiety CAT. Patients responding to the opioid question, plus the UE CAT or QuickDASH, were included. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression modelling were used to assess factors associated with baseline scores. RESULTS: Of 5997 included patients, 1,046 (17.4%) reported baseline opioid use. Patients in the opioid group demonstrated significantly worse scores on all patient-reported outcomes, and a significantly greater proportion of patients with PROMIS Depression CAT scores exceeding 60 (associated with a clinical diagnosis of depression; 29.5% vs 15.5%). Lower functional scores were observed in the opioid group after controlling for age, sex, other activity-limiting comorbidities, and either depression (UE CAT -7.0; QuickDASH +18.1; and PF CAT -6.6 points), anxiety (UE CAT -6.3; QuickDASH +16.4; PF CAT -6.3), or PI (UE CAT -3.7; QuickDASH +9.5; and PF CAT -4.2 points). Pain interference was greater among opiate users when controlling for age, sex, other activity-limiting comorbidities, and baseline function or psychological status: PI was 2.5, 5.0, or 4.3 points greater when controlling for the PROMIS UE CAT, Depression CAT, or Anxiety CAT. CONCLUSIONS: New patients presenting to a hand surgery clinic who endorse use of opioid medications at baseline report significantly decreased physical function, increased psychological burden, and greater levels of pain interference than nonusers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal data suggest that jet fuels such as JP-8 are associated with hearing deficits when combined with noise and that the effect is more pronounced than with noise exposure alone. Some studies suggest peripheral dysfunction while others suggest central auditory dysfunction. Human data are limited in this regard. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible chronic adverse effects of JP-8 combined with noise exposure on the peripheral and central auditory systems in humans. METHODS: Fifty-seven participants who were current personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were selected. Based on their levels of exposure to jet fuels, participants were divided into three exposure groups (low, moderate, high). Groups were also categorised based on their noise exposure levels (low, moderate, high). All participants were evaluated by tympanometry, pure-tone audiometry (1-12 kHz), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), words-in-noise, compressed speech, dichotic digit test, pitch pattern sequence test, duration pattern sequence test and adaptive test of temporal resolution. All auditory tests were carried out after the participants were away from the Air Force base for a minimum of two weeks, thus two weeks without jet fuel and noise exposure. RESULTS: Jet fuel exposure was significantly associated with hearing thresholds at 4 and 8 kHz; average hearing thresholds across frequencies in the better ear; DPOAEs at 2.8, 4 and 6 kHz; ABR wave V latency in the right ear; compressed speech and words-in-noise. Further analyses revealed that participants with low exposure level to jet fuels showed significantly better results for the aforementioned procedures than participants with moderate and high exposure levels. All results were controlled for the covariates of age and noise exposure levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that jet fuel exposure, when combined with noise exposure, has an adverse effect on audibility in humans. Taking all the test results into consideration, jet fuel exposure combined with noise exposure specifically seems to affect the peripheral hearing system in humans.

AB  - Genome-wide sequencing enables evaluation of associations between traits and combinations of variants in genes and pathways. But such evaluation requires multi-locus association tests with good power, regardless of the variant and trait characteristics. And since analyzing families may yield more power than analyzing unrelated individuals, we need multi-locus tests applicable to both related and unrelated individuals. Here we describe such tests, and we introduce SKAT-X, a new test statistic that uses genome-wide data obtained from related or unrelated subjects to optimize power for the specific data at hand. Simulations show that: a) SKAT-X performs well regardless of variant and trait characteristics; and b) for binary traits, analyzing affected relatives brings more power than analyzing unrelated individuals, consistent with previous findings for single-locus tests. We illustrate the methods by application to rare unclassified missense variants in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA2, as applied to combined data from prostate cancer families and unrelated prostate cancer cases and controls in the Multi-ethnic Cohort (MEC). The methods can be implemented using open-source code for public use as the R-package GATARS (Genetic Association Tests for Arbitrarily Related Subjects) <https://gailg.github.io/gatars/>.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiatrists' unique training in person-centered biopsychosocial management of complex problems may influence musculoskeletal patients' expectations and self- and/or physician-referral patterns to physiatrists. Consequently, average patient complexity and need for multi-disciplinary services may be increased in physiatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare musculoskeletal patients' self-reported physical and emotional health according to provider specialty. Researchers tested the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores between patients who present to physiatrists in comparison to other musculoskeletal specialists. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Orthopedic department of a tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Participants included 31 791 new adult patients (mean age 52.6 +/- 16.2 years) who presented for initial elective evaluation of a musculoskeletal problem by an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine trained emergency medicine, family medicine, pediatric, or physiatric physician. METHODS: Patients completed the PROMIS computer adaptive test (CAT) Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression domains at department check-in prior to the physician encounter. Score differences by provider type were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Mean PROMIS score in each domain subdivided by physiatric, surgical, and other nonsurgical provider type. RESULTS: In total, 2081 patients presented to physiatrists, 28 267 presented to surgeons, and 1443 presented to other nonsurgical providers. For each respective provider type, average PROMIS scores were Physical Function 38.9 +/- 8.2, 41.5 +/- 9.5, and 43.5 +/- 8.2; Pain Interference 62.6 +/- 7.2, 60.9 +/- 7.7, and 59.2 +/- 6.8; Anxiety 54.5 +/- 10.4, 51.9 +/- 10.6, and 49.8 +/- 9.8; and Depression 49.3 +/- 10.4, 47.0 +/- 10.0, and 44.2 +/- 8.7. Physiatric patients had significantly worse average scores for all domains compared to surgical (P < .001) and other nonsurgical patients (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Average PROMIS Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression scores were worse in musculoskeletal patients who presented to physiatrists in comparison to surgical or other nonsurgical providers. This suggests that some patients who choose to see or are referred to see physiatrists may have more or be more willing to endorse having biopsychosocial impairments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data. RESULTS: Many existing GWAS summary data-based association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by individual trait-based association test. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All the proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely efficient: it takes less than 2 min to compute the list of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux desktop. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Many GWAS conducted in the past decade have identified tens of thousands of disease related variants, which in total explained only part of the heritability for most traits. There remain many more genetics variants with small effect sizes to be discovered. This has motivated the development of sequencing studies with larger sample sizes and increased resolution of genotyped variants, e.g., the ongoing NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) whole genome sequencing project. An alternative approach is the development of novel and more powerful statistical methods. The current dominating approach in the field of GWAS analysis is the "single trait single variant" association test, despite the fact that most GWAS are conducted in deeply-phenotyped cohorts with many correlated traits measured. In this paper, we aim to develop rigorous methods that integrate multiple correlated traits and multiple variants to improve the power to detect novel variants. In recognition of the difficulty of accessing raw genotype and phenotype data due to privacy and logistic concerns, we develop methods that are applicable to publicly available GWAS summary data. RESULTS: We build rigorous statistical models for GWAS summary statistics to motivate novel multi-trait SNP-set association tests, including variance component test, burden test and their adaptive test, and develop efficient numerical algorithms to quickly compute their analytical P-values. We implement the proposed methods in an open source R package. We conduct thorough simulation studies to verify the proposed methods rigorously control type I errors at the genome-wide significance level, and further demonstrate their utility via comprehensive analysis of GWAS summary data for multiple lipids traits and glycemic traits. We identified many novel loci that were not detected by the individual trait based GWAS analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We have implemented the proposed methods in an R package freely available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MSKAT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop new patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to better understand feelings of loss in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of civilians with TBI (n=344) or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Feelings of Loss-Self and TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Person with Traumatic Brain Injury item banks. RESULTS: While the initial exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the feelings of loss item pool (98 items) potentially supported a unidimensional set of items, further analysis indicated 2 different factors: Feelings of Loss-Self (43 items) and Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI (20 items). For Feelings of Loss-Self, an additional 13 items were deleted due to item-response theory-based item misfit; the remaining 30 items had good overall model fit (comparative fit index [CFI]=0.96, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI]=.96, root mean squared error of approximation [RMSEA]=.10). For Feelings of Loss-Other, 1 additional item was deleted due to an associated high correlated error modification index value; the final 19 items evidenced good overall model fit (CFI=0.97, TLI=.97, RMSEA=.095). The final item banks were developed to be administered as either a Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) or a short-form (SF). Clinical experts approved the content of the 6-item SFs of the 2 measures (3-week test-retest was r=.87 for Feelings of Loss-Self and r=.85 for Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study resulted in the development of 2 new PROs to assess feelings of loss in caregivers of individuals with TBI; TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Self and TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI. Good psychometric properties were established and an SF was developed for ease of use in clinical situations. Additional research is needed to determine concurrent and predictive validity of these measures in the psychological treatment of those caring for persons with TBI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate recognition of mental health problems is a prerequisite for successful treatment. Although most people tend to consult their general practitioner (GP) when they first experience mental health problems, GPs are not very well equipped to screen for various forms of psychopathology to help them determine clients' need for treatment. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the development and characteristics of CATja, a computerized adaptive test battery built to facilitate triage in primary care settings, are described, and first results of its implementation are reported. METHODS: CATja was developed in close collaboration with GPs and mental health assistants (MHAs). During implementation, MHAs were requested to appraise clients' rankings (N=91) on the domains to be tested and to indicate the treatment level they deemed most appropriate for clients before test administration. We compared the agreement between domain score appraisals and domain score computed by CATja and the agreement between initial (before test administration) treatment level advice and final treatment level advice. RESULTS: Agreements (Cohen kappas) between MHAs' appraisals of clients' scores and clients' scores computed by CATja were mostly between .40 and .50 (Cohen kappas=.10-.20), and the agreement between "initial" treatment levels and the final treatment level advised was .65 (Cohen kappa=.55). CONCLUSIONS: Using CATja, caregivers can efficiently generate summaries of their clients' mental well-being on which decisions about treatment type and care level may be based. Further validation research is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research documents that greater psychologic distress (anxiety/depression) and less effective coping strategies (catastrophic thinking, kinesophobia) are associated with greater pain intensity and greater limitations. Recognition and acknowledgment of verbal and nonverbal indicators of psychologic factors might raise opportunities for improved psychologic health. There is evidence that specific patient words and phrases indicate greater catastrophic thinking. This study tested proposed nonverbal indicators (such as flexion of the wrist during attempted finger flexion or extension of uninjured fingers as the stiff and painful finger is flexed) for their association with catastrophic thinking. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do patients with specific protective hand postures during physical examination have greater pain interference (limitation of activity in response to nociception), limitations, symptoms of depression, catastrophic thinking (protectiveness, preparation for the worst), and kinesophobia (fear of movement)? (2) Do greater numbers of protective hand postures correlate with worse scores on these measures? METHODS: Between October 2014 and September 2016, 156 adult patients with stiff or painful fingers within 2 months after sustaining a finger, hand, or wrist injury were invited to participate in this study. Six patients chose not to participate as a result of time constraints and one patient was excluded as a result of inconsistent scoring of a possible hand posture, leaving 149 patients for analysis. We asked all patients to complete a set of questionnaires and a sociodemographic survey. We used Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression, Upper Extremity Physical Function, and Pain Interference computer adaptive test (CAT) questionnaires. We used the Abbreviated Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4) to measure catastrophic thinking in response to nociception. Finally, we used the Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia (TSK) to assess fear of movement. The occurrence of protective hand postures during the physical examination was noted by both the physician and researcher. For uncertainty or disagreement, a video of the physical examination was recorded and a group decision was made. RESULTS: Patients with one or more protective hand postures did not score higher on the PROMIS Pain Interference CAT (hand posture: 59 [56-64]; no posture: 59 [54-63]; difference of medians: 0; p = 0.273), Physical Function CAT (32 +/- 8 versus 34 +/- 8; mean difference: 2 [confidence interval CI, -0.5 to 5]; p = 0.107), nor the Depression CAT (48 [41-55] versus 48 [42-53]; difference of medians: 0; p = 0.662). However, having at least one hand posture was associated with a higher degree of catastrophic thinking (PCS scores: 13 [6-26] versus 10 [3-16]; difference of medians: 3; p = 0.0104) and a higher level of kinesophobia (TSK: 40 +/- 6 versus 38 +/- 6; mean difference: -2 [CI, -4 to -1]; p = 0.0420). Greater catastrophic thinking was associated with a greater number of protective hand postures on average (rho: 0.20, p = 0.0138). CONCLUSIONS: Protective hand postures and (based on prior research) specific words and phrases are associated with catastrophic thinking and kinesophobia, less effective coping strategies that hinder recovery. Surgeons can learn to recognize these signs and begin to treat catastrophic thinking and kinesophobia starting with compassion, empathy, and patience and be prepared to add formal support (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy) to help facilitate recovery.

AB  - PURPOSE: Prior research regarding the impact of mental health on upper extremity musculoskeletal function and recovery has frequently grouped catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression. This study was designed to define the relative prevalence of heightened anxiety versus depressive symptoms among a patient population seeking upper extremity care and to determine if those prevalences varied according to the symptomatic condition. METHODS: All adult patients presenting to a tertiary upper extremity orthopedic center between June 1, 2016 and November 30, 2016 (n = 3,315) completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety and Depression Computer Adaptive Tests. Descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression assessed differences in average PROMIS scores between demographic and diagnostic groups. Patients were also analyzed according to crossing thresholds for heightened anxiety and depression scores based on established linkage tables with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Depression scales, respectively. Pearson chi-square analysis and binary logistic regression were performed to determine if the proportion of patients crossing these thresholds varied according to the primary symptomatic condition while accounting for patient age, sex, and race. RESULTS: African American patients and those with carpal tunnel syndrome, trapeziometacarpal arthritis, or shoulder conditions reported significantly higher PROMIS Anxiety scores. Higher PROMIS Depression scores varied only by diagnosis. Seventeen percent of patients exceeded the Anxiety symptoms score threshold and 10% of patients exceeded the Depression symptom threshold. In logistic regression modeling, the likelihood of exceeding the Anxiety threshold varied by diagnosis and was increased in African American patients and females. African American race was associated with exceeding the Depression threshold while accounting for sex and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with upper extremity conditions more frequently report heightened anxiety than heightened depression. Patient race and diagnosis are independent predictors of anxiety among patients seeking care for upper extremity conditions. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.

AB  - During treatment of lymphedema, routine use of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) is recommended to monitor patient progress; however, the validity functional status (FS) PROMs in these patients is unknown. Our aims were to examine construct validity of the shoulder computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and the foot-and-ankle CAT, as a measure of FS for patients selecting the shoulder or the foot-and-ankle as their main body part affected by their lymphedema. We assessed the ability of the FS scores to distinguish between patient groups in clinically expected ways at admission and discharge from physical therapy. At admission (n=1600), patients who were younger and had more acute symptoms, less severe lymphedema, less co-morbidities, no relevant surgical history, did not use medications for chronic conditions, and exercised regularly, had higher FS. At discharge (n=611), patients who were younger and had less advanced lymphedema, fewer co-morbidities, no relevant surgical history, did not use medications for chronic conditions, exercised regularly, and had more acute symptoms had higher FS change, after controlling for their baseline FS score. Low participation rates in FS outcomes data collection could have biased results. Overall, the CAT-based FS PROMs used in this study discriminated between patient groups in clinically logical ways both at intake and at discharge from lymphedema treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: The relationship between psychosocial factors and self-reported physical function among hand and upper extremity patients is complex. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) platform has attempted to create a variety of specifically targeted metrics that can be administered using computer adaptive testing (CAT). Three metrics measuring self-reported physical function (herein referred to in combination as "functional" metrics) include the PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT, PROMIS Upper Extremity (UE) CAT, and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH). Two metrics assessing psychosocial factors include the PROMIS Anxiety and Pain Interference (PI) CATs ("nonfunctional" metrics). This study evaluates whether the functional metrics were correlated with nonfunctional metrics. METHODS: The 5 questionnaires were administered prospectively on a tablet computer to all consecutive adult patients presenting to an outpatient hand and upper extremity (nonshoulder) clinic at a tertiary academic medical center from January 1 to November 1, 2014. For patients with multiple visits during the study period, only the first was included. Data were evaluated retrospectively to assess the relationship between functional and nonfunctional measures, with Pearson correlation coefficients to understand the relationship between continuous variables, and 1-way analysis of variance to examine for differences in outcome measures across demographic groups. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine factors predicting functional disability. RESULTS: We included 1,299 patients: mean age was 46.8 years, 53% were female, and 23% were unemployed or on disability. The PROMIS PF CAT, PROMIS UE CAT, and QuickDASH scores were all significantly correlated with PROMIS Anxiety CAT (Pearson correlation coefficients, -0.46, -0.48, and 0.53, respectively) and PROMIS PI CAT (-0.60, -0.65, and 0.76, respectively) scores. Multivariable regression analyses demonstrated that increased PROMIS Anxiety and PI CAT scores each independently and adversely influenced PROMIS PF CAT, PROMIS UE CAT, and QuickDASH scores. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of patient anxiety and pain interference are independently associated with decreased patient-reported upper extremity function. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides further support of the biopsychosocial model by highlighting that increased anxiety is associated with decreased self-reported function using the PROMIS platform.

AB  - Computer adaptive testing (CAT) is a kind of tailored testing, in that it is a form of computer-based testing that is adaptive to each test-taker's ability level. In this review, the impacts of CAT are discussed from different perspectives in order to illustrate crucial points to keep in mind during the development and implementation of CAT. Test developers and psychometricians often emphasize the efficiency and accuracy of CAT in comparison to traditional linear tests. However, many test-takers report feeling discouraged after taking CATs, and this feeling can reduce learning self-efficacy and motivation. A trade-off must be made between the psychological experiences of test-takers and measurement efficiency. From the perspective of educators and subject matter experts, nonstatistical specifications, such as content coverage, content balance, and form length are major concerns. Thus, accreditation bodies may be faced with a discrepancy between the perspectives of psychometricians and those of subject matter experts. In order to improve test-takers' impressions of CAT, the author proposes increasing the target probability of answering correctly in the item selection algorithm even if doing so consequently decreases measurement efficiency. Two different methods, CAT with a shadow test approach and computerized multistage testing, have been developed in order to ensure the satisfaction of subject matter experts. In the shadow test approach, a full-length test is assembled that meets the constraints and provides maximum information at the current ability estimate, while computerized multistage testing gives subject matter experts an opportunity to review all test forms prior to administration.

AB  - Due to its high dimensionality and high noise levels, analysis of a large brain functional network may not be powerful and easy to interpret; instead, decomposition of a large network into smaller subcomponents called modules may be more promising as suggested by some empirical evidence. For example, alteration of brain modularity is observed in patients suffering from various types of brain malfunctions. Although several methods exist for estimating brain functional networks, such as the sample correlation matrix or graphical lasso for a sparse precision matrix, it is still difficult to extract modules from such network estimates. Motivated by these considerations, we adapt a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) framework to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data to identify modular structures in brain functional networks. Modular structures are identified by using topological overlap matrix (TOM) elements in hierarchical clustering. We propose applying a new adaptive test built on the proportional odds model (POM) that can be applied to a high-dimensional setting, where the number of variables (p) can exceed the sample size (n) in addition to the usual p < n setting. We applied our proposed methods to the ADNI data to test for associations between a genetic variant and either the whole brain functional network or its various subcomponents using various connectivity measures. We uncovered several modules based on the control cohort, and some of them were marginally associated with the APOE4 variant and several other SNPs; however, due to the small sample size of the ADNI data, larger studies are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The computer adaptive test ACAT-cardio has been developed in order to screen cardiovascular rehabilitation patients for anxiety. This study aims at investigating the criterion validity, and identifying appropriate cut-off values for its use in cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: 106 cardiovascular rehabilitation patients were tested for anxiety disorders using the instruments ACAT-cardio and SKID-I. Receiver operating characteristics were employed to analyse the results of 3 stopping rules of the ACAT-cardio. RESULTS: ROC analyses for the stopping rules yielded areas under the curve (AUC) between 0.80 and 0.84. The ideal cut-off values of the ACAT-cardio (theta scores) were - 0.20 (sensitivity: 86%),-0.23 (sensitivity: 71%) and - 0.35 (sensitivity: 86%). CONCLUSIONS: The ACAT-cardio has proven to be a valid instrument that can be used for screening anxiety disorders in cardiac rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain intensity and disability correlate with psychosocial factors such as depression and pain interference (the degree to which pain interferes with activities of daily living) as much or more than pathophysiology in upper extremity illness. However, other factors like emotional support (perception of being cared for and valued as a person), instrumental support (perception of availability of tangible assistance when needed), positive psychosocial impact (perception and focus on the positive side of a difficult situation, sometimes characterized as posttraumatic growth, benefit-finding, or meaning making), also might be associated with disability in patients with upper extremity orthopaedic illness. This is the first published study, to our knowledge, addressing the potential association of emotional support, instrumental support, and positive psychosocial illness impact with disability in patients with upper extremity illness. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Is there a correlation between the QuickDASH and the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R))) emotional support Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT)? (2) Is there a correlation between the QuickDASH and PROMIS((R)) instrumental support CAT? (3) Is there a correlation between the QuickDASH and PROMIS((R)) positive psychosocial illness impact CAT? (4) Among the PROMIS((R)) measures of depression, emotional support, instrumental support, positive illness impact, and pain interference, which accounts for the most variance in QuickDASH scores? METHODS: One hundred ninety-three patients with upper extremity illness (55% women; average age, 51 +/- 18 years) of 213 approached (91% recruitment rate) completed the QuickDASH, and five different PROMIS((R)) CATs: pain interference (the degree to which pain interferes with accomplishing one's goals), depression, emotional support, psychosocial illness impact, and instrumental support. We recruited patients from the practice of three surgeons in hand service of the department of orthopaedic surgery at a major urban university hospital. RESULTS: Pearson Product Moment Correlations showed that emotional support (r = -0.18; p = 0.014) and instrumental support (r = -0.19; p = 0.008) were weakly and inversely associated with the QuickDASH), while positive psychosocial illness impact was moderately and inversely associated with the QuickDASH (r = -0.36; p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, pain interference, but not the social support measures, was the only psychosocial factor associated with the QuickDASH and alone explained 66% of variance. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional support, instrumental support and positive psychosocial illness impact are all individually associated with disability to a small degree, but pain interference (the degree to which pain interferes with accomplishing one's goals) has the strongest influence on magnitude of disability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1, prognostic study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia affects up to 10% of pregnancies worldwide and is one of the main causes of fetal morbidity and mortality. Although it has been linked to developmental delay, its long-term effects on neurologic development in children have yet to be sufficiently quantified. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether preeclampsia's severity and its obstetric management correlate to the degree of disability in these infants. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This is an observational and descriptive study performed on a population of 96 women who were diagnosed with preeclampsia at Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon between 2007 and 2014, and their 111 children. To evaluate the mother, we gathered data pertaining to her medical history, renal function markers, and medical management of the preeclampsia. To assess the children, we collected fetal growth measurements, acute fetal distress markers and main diagnoses at birth. We used the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory in its computerized adaptive test version (PEDI-CAT) to study performance in the relevant areas, and the TNO-AZL Preschool children Quality of Life (TAPQOL) to estimate health-related quality of life. RESULTS: PEDI-CAT percentiles were consistently lower in the social/cognitive domain than in other areas. Lower social/cognitive percentiles were associated to both lower maternal IgG levels and presence of necrotizing enterocolitis during the neonatal period. CONCLUSIONS: A connection between preeclampsia and poor social/cognitive outcomes exists that warrants further research.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between the total area marked on pain and numbness diagrams and psychosocial factors (depression, pain catastrophic thinking, and health anxiety). METHODS: A total of 155 patients marked painful and numb areas on separate hand diagrams. Patients also completed demographic, condition-related, and psychosocial (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression Computer Adaptive Test, and Short Health Anxiety Inventory) questionnaires. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to determine factors associated with total area marked on the pain and numbness diagrams. RESULTS: The total area marked on the pain diagram correlated with catastrophic thinking, symptoms of depression, and health anxiety. In multivariable analysis, catastrophic thinking was the sole predictor of marked pain area, accounting for 10% of variance in the hand pain diagram. The total area marked on the numbness diagram correlated with the interval between onset and visit, diagnosis, catastrophic thinking, and symptoms of depression. In multivariable analysis, the interval between onset and visit, a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, and catastrophic thinking were independently associated with total area marked on the hand numbness diagram. CONCLUSIONS: Catastrophic thinking was independently associated with larger pain and numbness areas on a hand diagram. This suggests that larger symptom markings on hand diagrams may indicate less effective coping strategies. Hand diagrams might be used as a basis for discussion of coping strategies and illness behavior in patients with upper extremity conditions. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are diagnosed without the classic signs of renal or osseous complications. Vague and subjective symptoms have been attributed to PHPT but have been difficult to measure during the medical encounter. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) of the National Institutes of Health contains validated measures of physical and mental health that can be administered by the use of computer-adaptive testing (CAT). The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of PROMIS assessment in the clinical setting to measure changes in patient-reported health before and after parathyroidectomy. We hypothesized that patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT would report greater improvement in mental and physical health compared with control patients. METHODS: Adult PHPT patients scheduled for parathyroidectomy and control patients requiring diagnostic thyroid operation were enrolled prospectively during a 6-month period. Patients were administered clinically relevant PROMIS health domains via CAT at a preoperative visit and 3 weeks after operation. A change in score of 5 or greater for each PROMIS instrument was defined as clinically important. Statistical significance of pre/post-surgery changes in scores was determined using paired t tests. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with PHPT and 9 control patients completed the study. The mean number of PROMIS items answered during an assessment was 67 (range 51-121, SD 15.4). Median completion time was 8.2 minutes (range 3.4-38.4, SD 4.7). Clinically important improvement after parathyroidectomy in the PHPT group was greater than in the control group in 5 PROMIS domains. The score improvement experienced by PHPT patients was 8.8 in Fatigue, 6.7 in Sleep-Related Impairment, 5.0 in Anxiety, 7.0 in Applied Cognition, and 6.2 in Depression (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: PROMIS is an efficient clinical assessment platform for measuring patient-reported outcomes in PHPT via CAT. Several domains of physical and mental health in patients with PHPT show statistically and clinically important improvement after parathyroidectomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive, psychometrically sound, and conceptually grounded patient reported outcomes (PRO) measurement system for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Individual interviews (n=44) and focus groups (n=65 individuals with SCI and n=42 SCI clinicians) were used to select key domains for inclusion and to develop PRO items. Verbatim items from other cutting-edge measurement systems (i.e. PROMIS, Neuro-QOL) were included to facilitate linkage and cross-population comparison. Items were field tested in a large sample of individuals with traumatic SCI (n=877). Dimensionality was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis. Local item dependence and differential item functioning were assessed, and items were calibrated using the item response theory (IRT) graded response model. Finally, computer adaptive tests (CATs) and short forms were administered in a new sample (n=245) to assess test-retest reliability and stability. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES: A calibration sample of 877 individuals with traumatic SCI across five SCI Model Systems sites and one Department of Veterans Affairs medical center completed SCI-QOL items in interview format. RESULTS: We developed 14 unidimensional calibrated item banks and 3 calibrated scales across physical, emotional, and social health domains. When combined with the five Spinal Cord Injury--Functional Index physical function banks, the final SCI-QOL system consists of 22 IRT-calibrated item banks/scales. Item banks may be administered as CATs or short forms. Scales may be administered in a fixed-length format only. CONCLUSIONS: The SCI-QOL measurement system provides SCI researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive, relevant and psychometrically robust system for measurement of physical-medical, physical-functional, emotional, and social outcomes. All SCI-QOL instruments are freely available on Assessment CenterSM.

AB  - Vaccine benefit is usually two-folded: (i) prevent a disease or, failing that, (ii) diminish the severity of a disease. To assess vaccine effect, we propose two adaptive tests. The weighted two-part test is a combination of two statistics, one on disease incidence and one on disease severity. More weight is given to the statistic with the larger a priori effect size, and the weights are determined to maximize testing power. The randomized test applies to the scenario where the total number of infections is relatively small. It uses information on disease severity to bolster power while preserving disease incidence as the primary interest. Properties of the proposed tests are explored asymptotically and by numerical studies. Although motivated by vaccine studies, the proposed tests apply to any trials that involve both binary and continuous outcomes for evaluating treatment effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of surveys is becoming popular in the health care industry for acquiring information useful to the accomplishment of several studies. Besides their exploitation on a large scale for conducting epidemiological studies, surveys are being increasingly carried out on a narrower perspective through the administration of questionnaires aimed at assessing the quality of life perceived by patients or their clinical status during mid- or long-term treatments. This is useful for managing resources or optimizing and individualizing treatments. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes Gquest, a platform for modeling, generating and administering questionnaires through mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. Gquest was motivated by the need of administering questionnaires during home treatments, albeit its applicability is rather general. The main requirement was to have a very simple, clean and easy to use platform able to support (a) physicians in the design and delivery of questionnaires and (b) outpatients in sending self-recorded outcomes to the clinical staff. METHODS: Gquest has two basic components. The first one is a model devised for representing questionnaires which is extremely flexible. It allows the generation of questions and answers of different types, supports adaptivity in the dialog with the user and enforces simple consistency rules for checking his input. The second component is an application able to run instances of those questionnaires. It downloads questionnaires over the air in terms of XML files from a server and stores them locally into the mobile repository. Questionnaires become then available to the user, who in our case is a patient or one of his relatives. The user can select which one to fill-in, according to his needs and/or the specific treatment protocol. The selected questionnaire may be filled-in all at once or be completed in subsequent steps over time since any input provided is persisted on a local database. Finally, when a questionnaire is closed all the answers are transparently synchronized to a server for further evaluation or statistical purposes. RESULTS: The platform has been exploited and tested in two medical domains where questionnaires have very different purposes; a quality of life pilot survey involving patients with atrial fibrillation within the EU-funded project MobiGuide, and an investigation of the users' needs during the requirements elicitation phase of a telemedicine project for the safe discharge of fragile patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gquest proved to be a suitable tool for dealing with a wide variety of question types and has been positively accepted by the patients enrolled in the pilot study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Smoking is a coping strategy for many smokers who then have difficulty finding new ways to cope with negative affect when they quit. This paper describes analyses conducted to develop and evaluate item banks for assessing the coping expectancies of smoking for daily and nondaily smokers. METHODS: Using data from a large sample of daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N = 1,183) smokers, we conducted a series of item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses (according to gender, age, and ethnicity) to arrive at a unidimensional set of items for daily and nondaily smokers. We also evaluated performance of short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive tests (CATs) for assessing coping expectancies of smoking. RESULTS: For both daily and nondaily smokers, the unidimensional Coping Expectancies item banks (21 items) are relatively DIF free and are highly reliable (0.96 and 0.97, respectively). A common 4-item SF for daily and nondaily smokers also showed good reliability (0.85). Adaptive tests required an average of 4.3 and 3.7 items for simulated daily and nondaily respondents, respectively, and achieved reliabilities of 0.91 for both when the maximum test length was 10 items. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides a new set of items that can be used to reliably assess coping expectancies of smoking, through a SF, CAT, or a tailored set selected for a specific research purpose.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe whether negative affect and sleep impairment are associated with the clinical effect of epidural steroid injections (ESIs) for low back pain. DESIGN: Observational study; patients were evaluated before ESI and 1 and 3 months after ESI. SETTING: Spine center and related treatment sites. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=158) seeking treatment for low back pain with or without radiculopathy. INTERVENTION: ESI for low back pain with or without radiculopathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the dependent (global pain severity for back and leg pain, pain behavior, pain interference) and independent variables (depression, sleep disturbance, and covariates of back pain response) with the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and legacy measures. Outcome was assessed cross-sectionally using multiple regression and longitudinally with path analysis. RESULTS: After 1 month, sleep disturbance was the only predictor for the global ratings of improvement in back pain (R(2)=16.8%) and leg pain (R(2)=11.4%). The proportions of variance explained by sleep disturbance and negative affect for all dependent variables were greater at 3 months than 1 month. Mediation analysis was significant for negative affect for the 3-month outcomes on PROMIS pain behavior (beta=.87, P<.01) and pain interference (beta=.37, P<.01). There was no evidence of mediation by sleep disturbance for any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect and sleep disturbance are associated with worse outcomes after ESI. Further research is needed to determine if treatment of negative affect and sleep disturbance prior to or concurrently with ESI will improve outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use item response theory (IRT) data simulations to construct and perform initial psychometric testing of a newly developed instrument, the Social Security Administration Behavioral Health Function (SSA-BH) instrument, that aims to assess behavioral health functioning relevant to the context of work. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey followed by IRT calibration data simulations. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Sample of individuals applying for Social Security Administration disability benefits: claimants (n=1015) and a normative comparative sample of U.S. adults (n=1000). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: SSA-BH measurement instrument. RESULTS: IRT analyses supported the unidimensionality of 4 SSA-BH scales: mood and emotions (35 items), self-efficacy (23 items), social interactions (6 items), and behavioral control (15 items). All SSA-BH scales demonstrated strong psychometric properties including reliability, accuracy, and breadth of coverage. High correlations of the simulated 5- or 10-item computer adaptive tests with the full item bank indicated robust ability of the computer adaptive testing approach to comprehensively characterize behavioral health function along 4 distinct dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Initial testing and evaluation of the SSA-BH instrument demonstrated good accuracy, reliability, and content coverage along all 4 scales. Behavioral function profiles of Social Security Administration claimants were generated and compared with age- and sex-matched norms along 4 scales: mood and emotions, behavioral control, social interactions, and self-efficacy. Using the computer adaptive test-based approach offers the ability to collect standardized, comprehensive functional information about claimants in an efficient way, which may prove useful in the context of the Social Security Administration's work disability programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Past research has found youth with disabilities to experience poor psychosocial outcomes, but little is known about factors related to psychosocial health among youth with spinal cord injury (SCI). OBJECTIVE: To describe psychosocial health among youth with SCI, examine relationships between psychosocial outcomes and demographic and injury-related factors, and examine relationships between aspects of psychosocial health. Youth activity, participation, quality of life (QOL), coping, anxiety and depression, and caregiver mental health were included. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a prospective study of 420 youth with SCI ages 1-18 and their primary caregivers. Activity data were also presented from a study developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) platform with 226 youth with SCI ages 8-21. RESULTS: Although relationships varied by factor, youth outcomes were related to youth age, sex, age at injury/injury duration, and level/extent of injury. Caregiver mental health related to child age and age at injury. Further, relationships were uncovered between aspects of psychosocial health: aspects of youth mental health were related to youth participation and QOL, youth coping was related to youth mental health, participation, and QOL, and caregiver mental health was related to child mental health and QOL. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial outcomes relate to each other and vary by child and injury-related factors and should be understood in a comprehensive, developmental context. Identifying best measures of activity and psychosocial functioning among youth with SCI and understanding factors related to their psychosocial health is critical to improving outcomes for the pediatric-onset SCI population.

AB  - PURPOSE: Considerable research has demonstrated the negative psychosocial impact of cancer. Recent work has highlighted positive psychosocial outcomes. Research is now needed to evaluate the relationship between negative and positive impacts. This paper reports the development and validation of a measurement model capturing positive and negative psychosocial illness impacts. METHODS: The sample included 754 cancer patients on- or post-treatment. Item development was informed by literature review, expert input patient interviews and the results of a pilot study of 205 cancer patients, resulting in 43 positive and 46 negative items. Factor analyses were used to evaluate the dimensionality of the item pools. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine relationships between psychosocial illness impact and other variables. RESULTS: Unidimensionality was demonstrated within but not across negative and positive impact items. ANOVA results showed differential relationships between negative and positive impacts, respectively, and patient sociodemographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Positive and negative psychosocial illness impacts are best conceptualized and measured as two independent factors. Computerized adaptive tests and short-form measures developed from this comprehensive psychosocial illness impact item bank may benefit future research and clinical applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the presence and impact of differential item functioning (DIF) in a set of knee-specific functional status (FS) items administered using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) among English (United States) and Hebrew (Israel) speaking patients receiving therapy for knee impairments. DIF occurs in an item if probabilities of endorsing responses differ across groups after controlling for the FS measured. METHODS: We analyzed data from 28,320 patients (14,160 U.S., 14,160 Israel) who completed the knee-specific CAT. Items were assessed for DIF by gender, age, symptom acuity, surgical history, exercise history, and language spoken using a hybrid technique that combines multiple ordinal logistic regression and item response theory FS estimates. RESULTS: Several items had non-uniform DIF for covariates including language, but unadjusted and DIF-adjusted functional status estimates were in strong concordance [ICC(2,1) values >/=0.97], and differences between unadjusted and adjusted FS scores represented <0.4% of the unadjusted FS standard deviation. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant DIF was identified in some items but represented negligible clinical impact. Results suggested no need to adjust items for DIF when assessing FS outcomes across groups of patients with knee impairments who answer the knee CAT items in English in the United States or Hebrew in Israel. These findings suggest negligible differences in cultural perceptions between English and Hebrew wording of these knee-specific CAT FS items.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was initiated to improve precision, reduce respondent burden, and enhance the comparability of health outcomes measures. We used item response theory (IRT) to construct and evaluate a preliminary item bank for physical function assuming four subdomains. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data from seven samples (N=17,726) using 136 items from nine questionnaires were evaluated. A generalized partial credit model was used to estimate item parameters, which were normed to a mean of 50 (SD=10) in the US population. Item bank properties were evaluated through Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) simulations. RESULTS: IRT requirements were fulfilled by 70 items covering activities of daily living, lower extremity, and central body functions. The original item context partly affected parameter stability. Items on upper body function, and need for aid or devices did not fit the IRT model. In simulations, a 10-item CAT eliminated floor and decreased ceiling effects, achieving a small standard error (< 2.2) across scores from 20 to 50 (reliability >0.95 for a representative US sample). This precision was not achieved over a similar range by any comparable fixed length item sets. CONCLUSION: The methods of the PROMIS project are likely to substantially improve measures of physical function and to increase the efficiency of their administration using CAT.

AB  - MOTIVATION: An important task in microarray data analysis is the selection of genes that are differentially expressed between different tissue samples, such as healthy and diseased. However, microarray data contain an enormous number of dimensions (genes) and very few samples (arrays), a mismatch which poses fundamental statistical problems for the selection process that have defied easy resolution. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a novel approach to the selection of differentially expressed genes in which test statistics are learned from data using a simple notion of reproducibility in selection results as the learning criterion. Reproducibility, as we define it, can be computed without any knowledge of the 'ground-truth', but takes advantage of certain properties of microarray data to provide an asymptotically valid guide to expected loss under the true data-generating distribution. We are therefore able to indirectly minimize expected loss, and obtain results substantially more robust than conventional methods. We apply our method to simulated and oligonucleotide array data.

AB  - A multistage testing strategy to detect QTL for resistance to infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon is proposed. First, genotyping of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) were carried out using dead offspring from a disease resistance challenge test. Second, AFLP genotyping among survivors followed by a Mendelian segregation test was performed. Third, within-family survival analyses using all offspring were developed and applied to significant TDT markers with Mendelian inheritance. Maximum-likelihood methodology was developed for TDT with dominant markers to exploit linkage disequilibrium within families. The strategy was tested with two full-sib families of Atlantic salmon sired by the same male and consisting of 79 offspring in total. All dead offspring from the two families were typed for 64 primer combinations, resulting in 340 scored markers. There were 26 significant results out of 401 TDTs using dead offspring. In the second stage, only 17 marker families showed Mendelian segregation and were tested in survival analysis. A permutation test was performed for all survival analyses to compute experimentwise P-values. Two markers, aaccac356 and agccta150, were significant at P < 0.05 when accounting for multiple testing in the survival analyses. The proposed strategy might be more powerful than current mapping strategies because it reduces the number of tests to be performed in the last testing stage.

AB  - Virtual environments (VEs), offering a new human-computer interaction paradigm, have attracted much attention, in clinical psychology, especially in the treatment of phobias. However, a possible new application of VR in psychology is as assessment tool: VEs can be considered as an highly sophisticated form of adaptive testing. This chapter describes the context of current psychological assessment and underlines possible advantages of a VR based assessment tool. The chapter also details the characteristics of BIVRS, Body Image Virtual Reality Scale, an assessment tool designed to assess cognitive and affective components of body image. It consists of a non-immersive 3D graphical interface through which the patient is able to choose between 9 figures of different size which vary in size from underweight to overweight. The software was developed in two architectures, the first (A) running on a single user desktop computer equipped with a standard virtual reality development software and the second (B) splitted into a server (B1) accessible via Internet and actually running the same virtual ambient as in (A) and a VRML client (B2) so that anyone can access the application.
