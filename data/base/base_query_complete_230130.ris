AB  - Stress becomes a significantly serious issue among university students and we need efficient tools to understand it more. The aim of present study is to develop a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to measure the mentioned stress, as pioneer project in Vietnam. In this vein, an item bank of 68 items has been constructed, which is based on Likert Polytomous Scales through five subdomains: behavior, academic performance, family, lecturer and finance. The sampling of the survey is large. It has assessed 2,085 students (704 males and 1,381 females). Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) Model is applied to develop Multidimensional Stress Scales and Computerized Adaptive Testing procedure. The result findings indicate that Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) can be used to develop new scale with psychometric properties. Indicated by various fit criteria MNSQ, standard errors, Z (t-test) implemented in software ConQuest. The subdomain has a good reliability (from .857 to .798). As respect to CATs, a simulated experiment based on the empirical data is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed computerized adaptive testing. The standard error of the estimated stress proficiencies are reported in this study. The 68 items stress data appropriate fit the Multidimensional model applied.

AB  - Multistage test (MST) designs promise efficient student ability estimates, an indispensable asset for individual diagnostics in high-stakes educational assessments. In high-stakes testing, annually changing test forms are required because publicly known test items impair accurate student ability estimation, and items of bad model fit must be continually replaced to guarantee test quality. This requires a large and continually refreshed item pool as the basis for high-stakes MST. In practice, the calibration of newly developed items to feed annually changing tests is highly resource intensive. Piloting based on a representative sample of students is often not feasible, given that, for schools, participation in actual high-stakes assessments already requires considerable organizational effort. Hence, under practical constraints, the calibration of newly developed items may take place on the go in the form of a concurrent calibration in MST designs. Based on a simulation approach this paper focuses on the performance of Rasch vs. 2PL modeling in retrieving item parameters when items are for practical reasons non-optimally placed in multistage tests. Overall, the results suggest that the 2PL model performs worse in retrieving item parameters compared to the Rasch model when there is non-optimal item assembly in the MST; especially in retrieving parameters at the margins. The higher flexibility of 2PL modeling, where item discrimination is allowed to vary, seems to come at the cost of increased volatility in parameter estimation. Although the overall bias may be modest, single items can be affected by severe biases when using a 2PL model for item calibration in the context of non-optimal item placement.

AB  - Computer Assisted Testing (CAT) system in Indonesia has been commonly used but only to displaying random exam questions and unable to detect the maximum performance of the test participants. This research proposes a simple way with a good level of accuracy in identifying the maximum ability of test participants. By applying the Bayesian probabilistic in the selection of random questions with a weight of difficulties, the system can obtain optimal results from participants compared to sequential questions. The accuracy of the system measured on the choice of questions at the maximum level of the examinee alleged ability by the system, compared to the correct answer from participants gives an average accuracy of 75% compared to 33% sequentially. This technique allows tests to be carried out in a shorter time without repetition, which can affect the fatigue of the test participants in answering questions.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of anxiety expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - Abstract Background/objective Entrepreneurial behavior is of great importance nowadays owing to its significance in the generation of economic, social, personal, and cultural wellbeing. This behavior is influenced by cognitive and personality characteristics, as well as by socioeconomic and contextual factors. Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate entrepreneurial personality. Method A bank of 120 items was created evaluating various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants (M age = 42.34; SDage = 12.96). Results The bank of items had an essentially unidimensional fit to the model. The CAT exhibited high accuracy for evaluating a wide range of θ scores, using a mean of 16 items with a very low standard error (M = 0.157). Relative validity evidence for the CAT was obtained with two additional tests of entrepreneurial personality (the Battery for the Assessment of the Enterprising Personality and the Measure of Enterpreneurial Tendencies and Abilities), with correlations of .908 and .657, respectively. Conclusions The CAT developed has appropriate psychometric properties for the evaluation of entrepreneurial people.

AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3–9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3–9-year-olds. The ATEM 3–9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3–9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3–9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3–9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional ...

AB  - Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper and Pencil (P&P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate θ. For the item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, …, 20, and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of the P&P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S (r > 0.5), (4) the value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the ...

Die CAT-Entwicklung geschah auf der Grundlage einer "modernen" Testtheorie, namens "Item Response Theorie" (IRT), die gegenüber der herkömmlichen "Klassischen Test-Theorie" (KTT) eine Reihe von messtheoretischen Vorteilen bietet. Es sollte erprobt werden, ob sich diese Vorteile auch in der praktischen Anwendung bei der Konstruktion eines CATs im klinisch-psychologischen Bereich wieder finden lassen. CATs ermöglichen die individuelle Anpassung der Itemdarbietung an die Merkmalsausprägung einer Person. Dies geschieht, indem Testpersonen während der CAT-Bearbeitung nur die Items zur Beantwortung dargeboten werden, welche dem individuellem Ausprägungsniveau einer Person optimal entsprechen ("adaptives Testen"). Dadurch kann eine deutliche Verringerung der Testlänge bei einem gleichzeitig konstant hohen Messpräzisionsniveau erreicht werden. Die IRT-basierte Testentwicklung des Angst-CATs gliedert sich in drei Schritte: (1.) die inhaltliche Auswahl angstrelevanter Items, (2.) die sequentielle statistische Itemanalyse und -selektion dieser Items mit dem Ziel, die Items mit der besten psychometrischen Qualität zur Konstruktion einer Itembank zu nutzen und (3.) die Implementierung der Itembank in einen computergestützten adaptiven Itemabfolge-Algorithmus, der die Präsentation der Items und die Schätzung der individuellen Angstausprägung von Testpersonen ermöglicht.

AB  - This paper analyzes a national technology and education program in Uruguay known as Plan Ceibal. This work studies a sample of over 105,000 students from 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of public primary education in that country. This work aims to assess the impact of technology on teaching and learning of English. The method adopted is based on log-file data to compare two different modalities of English teaching (a face-to-face and a blended model). Additionally, we explored the correlation between a common measure of online engagement when using the Learning Management System (LMS) and an adaptive English assessment. We examined the impact of the teaching modalities on the students engagement and to what extent the engagement can contribute to enhance the student learning of English. This work documents the steps followed to elaborate the common measure of engagement to ensure transparency and its replicability (or improvement). A strength of this work, in comparison with previous studies, is the number of cases analyzed as well as the age of the target population (primary school students). The results indicate that engagement is affected by at least three key factors: socio-cultural context, teaching modality, and the role that teachers play. In fact, the higher the engagement level, the larger the proportion of students who achieve a better learning outcome in the assessment. This study shows that the use of LMS enhanced the learning experience when this tool is integrated within the ecosystem of the teaching and learning process. The findings of this study are consistent with previous works in the field, for instance: the relevance of the context as well as the role of teaching. Although the measurement of engagement can help to understand students performance noteworthy that as a stand-alone dimension it is a poor predictor of performance. To consider additional factors associated with learning is still necessary.

AB  - Depressive disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and cause substantial harm and affliction as well as reduced quality of life and impaired psychosocial functioning. Apart from the clinical interview, questionnaires represent the most established and economic diagnostic instruments for depression. A multiplicity of questionnaires for depression has been developed across the past decades. However, several studies demonstrated substantial psychometric shortcomings of many depression questionnaires. Thus, further enhancements in this area appear to be mandatory. The present thesis comprises three studies that aim at further improving the quality of diagnostic methods for depression by making the benefits of modern test theoretical approaches, particularly the Rasch-Model, one of the Item-Response-Theory-Models, available for clinical practice. The first study aimed at providing an ample pool of depression items – the basic requirement for item bank calibration. A thorough review of existing diagnostic tools for depression and relevant literature led to a comprehensive compilation of depression items. Based on the relevance judgments of 49 adept clinical experts 157 relevant items were identified. An additional major finding of Study One was that clinical psychologists tended to regard emotional/ cognitive items as more important than psychiatrists while the latter tended to judge somatic items as more relevant than clinical psychologists. However, across all experts items about somatic complaints were considered as not relevant. The second study was the core of the current thesis and – based on the item pool of Study One – aimed at developing a calibrated item bank for depression and evaluating its psychometric properties. Evaluation of Rasch Model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), dimensionality, local independence, item spread, item and person separation, and reliability resulted in a bank of 79 items that showed good psychometric properties. However, a minority of items showed DIF that ...

AB  - Thesis (M.A. (Industrial Psychology))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. ; Selection and selection procedures play a key role in the ability of organisations to compete successfully in the complex global and local environment. South Africa is experiencing a serious artisinal and technical skill shortage. Given the unemployment issues and the quest for people to fill the skill shortage gap it is important for organizations to find possible solutions to ensure that they stay competitive and effective in the labour market. Research suggests that at least 12 500 artisans need to be produced each year from 2006 to 2010 to meet the demand for skilled workers. To address above mentioned challenge organizations have to develop strategies to assist them to select individuals with the best chance to succeed in training. Unfortunately, the solution is not simple as organisations have a multitude of influences and pressures which affect their decisions regarding selection procedures. Selection of individuals is becoming an increasingly complex science as organisations have to select a capable and representative workforce. They must thus select candidates that are most likely to benefit from what is offered educationally, meet the requirements stipulated in South Africa's Labour legislation, and will perform most successfully in the specific trade. Bad practice can lead to costly litigation. The objectives of this mini-dissertation were to assess the empirical validity of the Technical Test Battery (TTB), as ability test and the Learning Potential Computerised Adaptive Test (LPCAT) as learning potential test as predictors of academic success of first year apprentice electrician students at a South African technical college serving a mining community. The study explored the current local employment issues that affect selection for training in the technical fields. The difference between the measurement of cognitive ability and learning potential were examined and the nature of the constructs of cognitive ability and that of learning potential were discussed. In the empirical study one of the objectives was to determine whether there was a relationship between the TTB and the LPCAT as two different predictors of the academic success of first yar apprentice electrician students. The difference in the empirical (predictive) validity of the two psychometric selection instruments, if only one of the tests as opposed to if both were used in combination, were examined. Another objective was to determine if there were any differences regarding the scores on the TTB and LPCAT of students from the designated group as opposed to that of students from non-designated groups. Finally this study explored whether the TTB and LPCAT were valid predictors to be used as selection instruments for apprentice electrician students in the South African context The research method consisted of a literature review and an empirical study. The empirical validity of the two predictor tests was validated in terms of the accuracy with which the selection instruments predicted the students' future performance. This research can be categorized as descriptive quantitative research. The TTB and LPCAT scores of a sample of 89 selected apprentice electricians were compared with the number of attempts they used to pass a phase test. Data was analysed by means of descriptive statistics. Pearsons Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, t-tests, ANOVAs as well as discriminant analysis were also used to reach the research objective. Statistically significant relationships were found between the predictor and criterion variables. The results confirm that the TTB and LPCAT are indeed empirical valid tests that can be used in the selection of apprentice electricians. ; Masters

AB  - Many cutting-edge computer and electronic products are powered by advanced Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Advanced SoCs encompass superb performance together with large number of functions. This is achieved by efficient integration of huge number of transistors. Such very large scale integration is enabled by a core-based design paradigm as well as deep-submicron and 3D-stacked-IC technologies. These technologies are susceptible to reliability and testing complications caused by thermal issues. Three crucial thermal issues related to temperature variations, temperature gradients, and temperature cycling are addressed in this thesis. Existing test scheduling techniques rely on temperature simulations to generate schedules that meet thermal constraints such as overheating prevention. The difference between the simulated temperatures and the actual temperatures is called temperature error. This error, for past technologies, is negligible. However, advanced SoCs experience large errors due to large process variations. Such large errors have costly consequences, such as overheating, and must be taken care of. This thesis presents an adaptive approach to generate test schedules that handle such temperature errors. Advanced SoCs manufactured as 3D stacked ICs experience large temperature gradients. Temperature gradients accelerate certain early-life defect mechanisms. These mechanisms can be artificially accelerated using gradient-based, burn-in like, operations so that the defects are detected before shipping. Moreover, temperature gradients exacerbate some delay-related defects. In order to detect such defects, testing must be performed when appropriate temperature-gradients are enforced. A schedule-based technique that enforces the temperature-gradients for burn-in like operations is proposed in this thesis. This technique is further developed to support testing for delay-related defects while appropriate gradients are enforced. The last thermal issue addressed by this thesis is related to temperature cycling. Temperature cycling test procedures are usually applied to safety-critical applications to detect cycling-related early-life failures. Such failures affect advanced SoCs, particularly through-silicon-via structures in 3D-stacked-ICs. An efficient schedule-based cycling-test technique that combines cycling acceleration with testing is proposed in this thesis. The proposed technique fits into existing 3D testing procedures and does not require temperature chambers. Therefore, the overall cycling acceleration and testing cost can be drastically reduced. All the proposed techniques have been implemented and evaluated with extensive experiments based on ITC’02 benchmarks as well as a number of 3D stacked ICs. Experiments show that the proposed techniques work effectively and reduce the costs, in particular the costs related to addressing thermal issues and early-life failures. We have also developed a fast temperature simulation technique based on a closed-form solution for the temperature equations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed simulation technique reduces the schedule generation time by more than half.

Поступление в высшее учебное заведение является переходом в новую систему образования, новую социальную среду, что определяет необходимость адаптации первокурсников непосредственно к учебному процессу. В статье рассмотрены социальные, педагогические и психологические факторы (как в позитивном аспекте, так и в негативном), влияющие на педагогический процесс и содержание методической системы учебной адаптации первокурсников в условиях филиала вуза. В условиях работы по программам ФГОС ВПО адаптация в вузе возможна путем индивидуализации и объективизации процесса преподавания отдельных предметов, в том числе физики. Предложены пути решения проблемы учебной адаптации первокурсников на примере обучения физике в филиале технического вуза. ; Young people living in small towns and in rural areas, do not always have the possibility to enter major universities, many of them study in their branches. Admission to University is accompanied by the transition to a new educational system, new social environment, which causes need for adaptating first-year students to the educational process. The article considers social, pedagogical and psychological factor, both positive and negative affecting the pedagogical process and the content of systematic adaptation while educating first-year students in the conditions of a University branch. Under conditions of realizing federal state educational standards of higher professional education it is estimated that adaptation is possible by means of individualizing instructions and implementing objective approach into teaching all courses including Physics. The article offers some ways of solving the problem of educational adaptation given on the basis of teaching first-year students Physics at a Polytechnics’ branch.

AB  - The understanding of the mechanical behavior of the unsaturated soils has been significantly enhanced due to the recent advancement of technology and modifications to the conventional testing devices. However, the implementation of the concepts of unsaturated soil has lagged, mainly due to the risks associated with the development of civil infrastructure based on practically untested theories and the limited reliable prediction methods for compacted, expansive, residual, and collapsible soils, which requires reliable and comprehensive experimental data. Moreover, the tests on unsaturated soils are enormously time consuming and often exorbitantly expensive, which further hinders the use of unsaturated soil mechanics in practical applications. Additionally, the liquefaction of cohesionless soils has predominantly been considered only for saturated soils. However, the soils with high degree of saturation, yet partially saturated, which are mostly near the ground surface and have low overburden pressure, may liquefy during earthquakes. Since plenty of unsaturated cohesionless soils are present near high seismic activity zones, the susceptibility of these soils to liquefy needs to be studied. Addressing these problems has been the main objective of the present dissertation research. The characteristics of compacted soils were studied by performing an elaborate series of suction-controlled monotonic triaxial tests on compacted silty soil specimens following the hydrostatic compression (HC) and the conventional triaxial compression (CTC) stress paths at varying net mean stresses and matric suction levels. The multistage triaxial tests were performed on the silty soil specimens at varying suction levels using a new approach to address the issues related to soil variability and to significantly reduce the testing time while maintaining the reliability of the test results. The Barcelona Basic Model (BBM) framework was used to reproduce experimental test results both from suction-controlled single-stage and multistage triaxial tests. Hence the BBM was indirectly used to demonstrate the utility of multistage triaxial tests in replicating test results or predictions similar to single-stage triaxial testing. The influence of suction, unit weight, and wetting and drying of the compacted specimens of silty soil on the resilient modulus was also studied by performing a comprehensive series of suction-controlled repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests over a wide range of suction to address the issue of repeatability of RLT tests. In this dissertation research, the tendency of the soil in unsaturated condition to liquefy was studied by performing cyclic triaxial tests on suction-equilibrated silty sand specimens. A series of cyclic triaxial tests were performed in undrained conditions at varying suction states and cyclic stress ratios to assess the liquefaction potential of the soil at varying relative densities and matric suction levels. The findings from this dissertation research would assist in the development of future constitutive models for predicting the response of dilatant soils in unsaturated conditions subjected to monotonic and dynamic loading.

AB  - Papers in this third volume deals with the Covid-19 pandemic which is having an enormous impact on education systems worldwide. Policy makers, teachers, school managers, parents and students have been called to the reinvent their way of ‘doing school’. At the same time, the governance of the education system and schools’ organizations have been exposed to unprecedented tensions. The pandemic emergency has been a lens revealing intersections and structural tensions among various level and actors of the education system, but also allowing opportunities of changes thanks to the exogenous shock. At the same time, it must be considered that the emergency is interacting on pre-existing inequalities and contradictions. Higher education systems have been affected too: in constant evolution due to constant transformations of society and changed functions of knowledge, universities have undergone a structural change along with pandemic times. Simultaneously, the growing relevance of knowledge for the economic development of the capitalistic system has profoundly affected higher education systems, characterized by the neo-liberal approach which his subject of increasing critical analysis. ; In this paper we present results on the estimation of mathematics skills of Italian grade 10 students with special educational needs. The estimation was carried out by means of a com-puter based multilevel adaptive test 1 - 3 - 3 (MST) constructed within the framework of a doctoral research in Social, Developmental and Educational Research Psychology. An item bank was used to construct the MST test. Verification of the unidimensionality of the bank was done through exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and analysis of model fit indices with Rasch's model (Rasch, 1960) being calibrated. Verification of the best measurement properties of the test compared to a linear test was performed by comparing information functions. It is shown that this type of test is able to provide estimates of the ability of students with a con-siderable level of ...

AB  - We used the Dutch-Flemish version of the USA PROMIS adult V1.0 item bank for Anxiety as input for developing a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure the entire latent anxiety continuum. First, psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample (N = 2,010) showed that the 29-item bank has psychometric properties that are required for a CAT administration. Second, a post hoc CAT simulation showed efficient and highly precise measurement, with an average number of 8.64 items for the clinical sample, and 9.48 items for the general population sample. Furthermore, the accuracy of our CAT version was highly similar to that of the full item bank administration, both in final score estimates and in distinguishing clinical subjects from persons without a mental health disorder. We discuss the future directions and limitations of CAT development with the Dutch-Flemish version of the PROMIS Anxiety item bank. ; Stress-related psychiatric disorders across the life span

AB  - Şenel, Selma (Balikesir Author) ; This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

AB  - Recently, adaptive test approaches have become a viable alternative to traditional fixed-item tests. The main advantage of adaptive tests is that they reach desired measurement precision with fewer items. However, fewer items mean that each item has a more significant effect on ability estimation and therefore those tests are open to more consequential results from any flaw in an item. So, any items indicating differential item functioning (DIF) may play an important role in examinees&#039; test scores. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effect of DIF items on the performance of computer adaptive and multi-stage tests. For this purpose, different test designs were tested under different test lengths and ratios of DIF items using Monte Carlo simulation. As a result, it was seen that computer adaptive test (CAT) designs had the best measurement precision over all conditions. When multi-stage test (MST) panel designs were compared, it was found that the 1-3-3 design had higher measurement precision in most of the conditions; however, the findings were not enough to say that 1-3-3 design performed better than the 1-2-4 design. Furthermore, CAT was found to be the least affected design by the increase of ratio of DIF items. MST designs were affected by that increment especially in the 10-item length test. ; Recently, adaptive test approaches have become a viable alternative to traditional fixed-item tests.

AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing a high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adatpive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators' responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback by solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

AB  - Although high unemployment rates exist in many countries of the world, companies continue to struggle to hire candidates whose personality traits and competencies match their needs. High unemployment rates and a global talent shortage can be seen as a fascinating contradiction that merits future research. This study investigates suitable personnel selection methods that assist recruiters in seeking the right person with the potential to contribute most to a business. It consolidates theories about personnel selection in a cross-national setting and link them with specific personality traits, job competencies, and person-organization fit (P-O fit) that could predict and enhance employee outcomes. The Most Valuable Employees and Average Contribution Employees can be classified by using Data Envelopment analysis (DEA) and Naïve Bayesian analysis based on a set of standards. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), different aspects of personality traits, employee competencies, P-O fit, and biographic information, these characteristics are found to influence the key workplace outcomes in the United States and China. In both countries, the three dimensions in the HEXACO personality inventory (Honesty-Humility, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience) are found to significantly effect the workplace outcomes. In addition, job competencies, and P-O fit are also proven to be significantly associated with the key work outcomes in these two countries. There are several limitations in this study associated with a relative small number of primary data collected from them. However, this study employs a web-based dynamic survey system to save time, improve the response rate, and provide assessment accuracy. Furthermore, DEA and Naïve Bayesian classifiers help to separate the Most Valuable Employees from other employees, which may have practical significance for both researchers and practitioners.

AB  - Item parameter drift (IPD) is the systematic differentiation of parameter values of items over time due to various reasons. If it occurs in computer adaptive tests (CAT), it causes errors in the estimation of item and ability parameters. Identification of the underlying conditions of this situation in CAT is important for estimating item and ability parameters with minimum error. This study examines the measurement precision of IPD and its impacts on the test information function (TIF) in CAT administrations. This simulation study compares sample size (1000, 5000), IPD size (0.00 logit, 0.50 logit, 0.75 logit, 1.00 logit), percentage of items containing IPD (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%), three time points and item bank size (200, 500, 1000) conditions. To examine the impacts of the conditions on ability estimations; measurement precision, and TIF values were calculated, and factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent samples was carried out to examine whether there were any differences between estimations in terms of these factors. The study found that an increase in the number of measurements using item bank with IPD items results in a decrease in measurement precision and the amount of information the test provides. Factorial ANOVA for independent samples revealed that measurements precision and TIF differences are mostly statistically significant. Although all IPD conditions negatively affect measurement precision and TIF, it has been shown that sample size and item bank size generally do not have an increasing or decreasing effect on these factors. ; Item parameter drift (IPD) is the systematic differentiation of parameter values of items over time due to various reasons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; aged 7-17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. RESULTS: Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

AB  - To investigate differential item functioning (DIF) of PROMIS Depression items between US and German samples we compared data from the US PROMIS calibration sample (n = 780), a German general population survey (n = 2,500) and a German clinical sample (n = 621). DIF was assessed in an ordinal logistic regression framework, with 0.02 as criterion for R2 -change and 0.096 for Raju's non-compensatory DIF. Item parameters were initially fixed to the PROMIS Depression metric; we used plausible values to account for uncertainty in depression estimates. Only four items showed DIF. Accounting for DIF led to negligible effects for the full item bank as well as a post hoc simulated computer-adaptive test (< 0.1 point on the PROMIS metric [mean = 50, standard deviation =10]), while the effect on the short forms was small (< 1 point). The mean depression severity (43.6) in the German general population sample was considerably lower compared to the US reference value of 50. Overall, we found little evidence for language DIF between US and German samples, which could be addressed by either replacing the DIF items by items not showing DIF or by scoring the short form in German samples with the corrected item parameters reported.

AB  - PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important patient-reported outcome in clinical and health research. The EQ-5D-Y assesses child and adolescent HRQoL by five items on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) on the current health state. This study investigates predictors of self-reported HRQoL according to the EQ-5D-Y in chronically ill children and adolescents using longitudinal data. METHODS: Data from the German Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes, and juvenile arthritis gathered over a period of six months were analyzed (n = 310; 7-17 years old; 48% female). Self-, parent-, and pediatrician-reported data were collected from June 2013 to October 2014. Generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models served to examine effects of socio-demographic as well as disease- and health-specific predictors on the items as well as on the VAS of the EQ-5D-Y. RESULTS: Ceiling effects for the EQ-5D-Y indicated low burden of disease in the analyzed sample. Longitudinal analyses revealed associations between less health complaints and better HRQoL for all investigated HRQoL domains. Further, age- and gender-specific effects, and associations of better disease control, longer duration of the disease and less mental health problems with better HRQoL were found. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective health complaints and mental health problems should be considered in the care of children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes, and juvenile arthritis. Future research should suggest administering the items of the EQ-5D-Y with five instead of three response options, and investigate HRQoL over a longer period.

AB  - International audience ; SRAM testing is becoming more and more challenging due to issues caused by continuous device scaling. Fabricated SRAMs are submitted to random and systematic process variability, which strongly affect the cell's behavior and also the ability of test algorithms to detect faults. Traditionally, bias conditions have been used to improve the behavior of the SRAM under process variations by applying body bias to compensate for the effect of variability. Based on the same principle, bias conditions also affect the cell's behavior when resistive-opens are present, hence affecting test's defect coverage capability. Both body- and source-bias conditions are analyzed in this paper to find the way to improve defect detect ability in the SRAM cell. Source-biasing has been proven to be the more effective of the two, leading to more than 3X improvement of the defect detected value. Also, by adapting the source-bias conditions to process parameter values, over- and under-testing of the SRAM can be avoided.

AB  - Backgound: Assessing specific personality traits has shown better predictive power of enterprising personality than have broad personality traits. Hitherto, there have been no instruments that evaluate the combination of specific personality traits of enterprising personality in an adaptive format. So, the aim was to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) to assess enterprising personality in young people. Methods: A pool of 161 items was developed and applied to two sets of participants (n1 = 357 students, Mage = 17.89; SDage = 3.26; n2 = 2,693 students; Mage = 16.52, SDage = 1.38) using a stratified sampling method. Results: 107 items that assess achievement motivation, risk-taking, innovativeness, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, internal locus of control, and optimism were selected. The assumption of unidimensionality was tested. The CAT demonstrated high precision for a wide range of q, using a mean of 10 items and demonstrating a relatively low Standard Error (0.378). Conclusions: A brief, valid, and precise instrument was obtained with relevant implications for educational and entrepreneurial contexts. ; Un Test Adaptativo Informatizado para la evaluación de la personalidad emprendedora en jóvenes. Antecedentes: la evaluación de rasgos específicos de personalidad, respecto a rasgos generales, ha demostrado un mayor poder predictivo de la personalidad emprendedora.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

AB  - Stress becomes a significantly serious issue among university students and we need efficient tools to understand it more. The aim of present study is to develop a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to measure the mentioned stress, as pioneer project in Vietnam. In this vein, an item bank of 68 items has been constructed, which is based on Likert Polytomous Scales through five subdomains: behavior, academic performance, family, lecturer and finance. The sampling of the survey is large. It has assessed 2,085 students (704 males and 1,381 females). Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) Model is applied to develop Multidimensional Stress Scales and Computerized Adaptive Testing procedure. The result findings indicate that Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit (MRCML) can be used to develop new scale with psychometric properties. Indicated by various fit criteria MNSQ, standard errors, Z (t-test) implemented in software ConQuest. The subdomain has a good reliability (from .857 to .798). As respect to CATs, a simulated experiment based on the empirical data is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed computerized adaptive testing. The standard error of the estimated stress proficiencies are reported in this study. The 68 items stress data appropriate fit the Multidimensional model applied.

AB  - Abstract Background/objective Entrepreneurial behavior is of great importance nowadays owing to its significance in the generation of economic, social, personal, and cultural wellbeing. This behavior is influenced by cognitive and personality characteristics, as well as by socioeconomic and contextual factors. Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate entrepreneurial personality. Method A bank of 120 items was created evaluating various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants (M age = 42.34; SDage = 12.96). Results The bank of items had an essentially unidimensional fit to the model. The CAT exhibited high accuracy for evaluating a wide range of θ scores, using a mean of 16 items with a very low standard error (M = 0.157). Relative validity evidence for the CAT was obtained with two additional tests of entrepreneurial personality (the Battery for the Assessment of the Enterprising Personality and the Measure of Enterpreneurial Tendencies and Abilities), with correlations of .908 and .657, respectively. Conclusions The CAT developed has appropriate psychometric properties for the evaluation of entrepreneurial people.

AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of anxiety expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria ( Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis , MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Entrepreneurial behavior is of great importance nowadays owing to its significance in the generation of economic, social, personal, and cultural wellbeing. This behavior is influenced by cognitive and personality characteristics, as well as by socioeconomic and contextual factors. Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate entrepreneurial personality. METHOD: A bank of 120 items was created evaluating various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants (M(age) = 42.34; SD(age) = 12.96). RESULTS: The bank of items had an essentially unidimensional fit to the model. The CAT exhibited high accuracy for evaluating a wide range of θ scores, using a mean of 16 items with a very low standard error (M = 0.157). Relative validity evidence for the CAT was obtained with two additional tests of entrepreneurial personality (the Battery for the Assessment of the Enterprising Personality and the Measure of Enterpreneurial Tendencies and Abilities), with correlations of .908 and .657, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The CAT developed has appropriate psychometric properties for the evaluation of entrepreneurial people.

AB  - Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous studies.

AB  - BackgroundSeparation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common mental disorders among children and adolescents, and it may seriously affect their growth, daily life, and learning. Self-report scales have been used for diagnosis, which require lengthy testing and personnel.MethodsA total of 1,241 adolescents were recruited from 16 junior- and senior-high schools in China. The initial item bank was selected from classical SAD scales according to the DSM-5. First, the optimal model was selected using item response theory (IRT) according to data fit. Then, per the IRT analysis, items that did not meet the psychometric requirements were deleted (e.g., discriminating values < 0.2). Consequently, a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for SAD was formed (CAT-SAD).ResultsAn average of 17 items per participant was required to achieve and maintain a 0.3 standard error of measurement in the SAD severity estimate. The estimated correlation of the CAT-SAD with the total 68-item test score was 0.955. CAT-SAD scores were strongly related to the probability of a SAD diagnosis with the Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale—Child and Adolescent Version. Therefore, SAD could be accurately predicted by the CAT-SAD.ConclusionsExploratory factor analyses revealed that SAD was unidimensional. The CAT-SAD, which has good reliability and validity and high sensitivity and specificity, provides an efficient test for adolescents with SAD as compared to standard paper-and-pencil tests. It can be used to diagnose varying degrees of SAD quickly and reliably and ease the burden on adolescents. Potential applications for inexpensive, efficient, and accurate screening of SAD are discussed.

AB  - Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper and Pencil (P&P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate θ. For the item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, …, 20, and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of the P&P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S (r > 0.5), (4) the value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the ...

AB  - Although much work has been done on computerized-adaptive test (CAT) in reducing anxiety towards exam, CAT in Malaysian educational setting is less explored among educational researchers. Some of the reason is due to technical difficulty in developing, maintaining the testing bank items, and insufficient hardware facilities for huge number of examinees in Malaysia. Hence, traditional assessment method is preferred to assess students’ performance. However, traditional assessment induced students’ anxiety towards examination. The effect of anxiety towards mathematics examination has deteriorated students’ performance particularly at polytechnics that offers technical-vocational-education-and-training (TVET). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of CAT in reducing examinees’ anxiety towards mathematics examination in comparison with traditional testing approaches at three polytechnics in northern Malaysia that offered diploma certification in engineering. These three polytechnics were chosen because it is classified as conventional and accessibility of the researchers to these samples. In order to ensure the homogeneity of the samples, students in their first year of study who enrolled in engineering mathematics were chosen. This research used quasi-experimental research method with non-equivalent control group design involving 300 students. Item-response-theory was used to describe examinees’ interaction with the test items. The results show that CAT has reduced examinees’ anxiety towards mathematics test in comparison to those of traditional testing. This study implies that CAT has benefited students in term of reducing their anxiety towards mathematics examination in the case of Malaysian polytechnics students, and has the potential to be adopted in TVET because it improves testing efficiency.

AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3–9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3–9-year-olds. The ATEM 3–9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3–9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3–9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3–9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional ...

AB  - The Musical Emotion Discrimination Task (MEDT) is a short, non-adaptive test of the ability to discriminate emotions in music. Test-takers hear two performances of the same melody, both played by the same performer but each trying to communicate a different basic emotion, and are asked to determine which one is “happier”, for example. The goal of the current study was to construct a new version of the MEDT using a larger set of shorter, more diverse music clips and an adaptive framework to expand the ability range for which the test can deliver measurements. The first study analysed responses from a large sample of participants (N = 624) to determine how musical features contributed to item difficulty, which resulted in a quantitative model of musical emotion discrimination ability rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT). This model informed the construction of the adaptive MEDT. A second study contributed preliminary evidence for the validity and reliability of the adaptive MEDT, and demonstrated that the new version of the test is suitable for a wider range of abilities. This paper therefore presents the first adaptive musical emotion discrimination test, a new resource for investigating emotion processing which is freely available for research use.

AB  - PURPOSE: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for depression in the general adult population. Although screening questionnaires for depression and anxiety exist in primary care settings, electronic health tools such as computerized adaptive tests based on item response theory can advance screening practices. This study evaluated the validity of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) for screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) and assessing MDD and anxiety severity among adult primary care patients. METHODS: We approached 402 English-speaking adults for participation from a primary care clinic, of whom 271 adults (71% female, 65% black) participated. Participants completed modules from the CAT-MH (Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD, CAT–Depression Inventory, CAT–Anxiety Inventory); brief paper questionnaires (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]); and a reference-standard interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) Diagnoses. RESULTS: On the basis of the interview, 31 participants met criteria for MDD and 29 met criteria for GAD. The diagnostic accuracy of the Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD (area under curve [AUC] = 0.85) was similar to that of the PHQ-9 (AUC = 0.84) and higher than that of the PHQ-2 (AUC = 0.76) for MDD screening. Using the interview as the reference standard, the accuracy of the CAT–Anxiety Inventory (AUC = 0.93) was similar to that of the GAD-7 (AUC = 0.97) for assessing anxiety severity. The patient-preferred screening method was assessment via tablet/computer with audio. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized adaptive testing could be a valid and efficient patient-centered screening strategy for depression and anxiety screening in primary care settings.

AB  - In the past, a German Computerized Adaptive Test, based on Item Response Theory (IRT), was developed for purposes of assessing the construct depression [Computer‐adaptive test for depression (D‐CAT)]. This study aims at testing the feasibility and validity of the real computer‐adaptive application. The D‐CAT, supplied by a bank of 64 items, was administered on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a predetermined reliability (r ≥ 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES‐D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)]. The D‐CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds), well accepted by the patients and reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95% of the cases, 10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between the D‐CAT and the HADS, CES‐D, and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The D‐CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established questionnaires do. The D‐CAT proved an efficient, well accepted and reliable tool. Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures, whereby the CAT is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item selection for content in the future.

AB  - Background: Universal screening is a critical component within a multi-tiered system of supports because it is the first mechanism by which students are identified as at-risk for failure. Screeners must have adequate psychometric properties to accurately identify students at-risk, however many measures result in moderate accuracy, indicating the presence of false negatives and false positives. These errors may affect the allocation of resources in schools, sometimes causing resources to be utilized unnecessarily and other times withholding services when they are needed. Purpose: This study examined the validity and diagnostic accuracy of a reading CAT using single time points and slopes within year, and longitudinally across one and two years. Methods: Screening and state test data were analyzed for students in third through fifth grade (N = 1696). Validity statistics were calculated using single time points and slopes on the CAT. Diagnostic accuracy analyses included the use of ROC curves to identify the CAT cut score associated with maximized sensitivity and specificity, and the cut score at the 25th and 40th percentile. Results: Correlation results for single screener points and the state test ranged from .60 to .79 (p = .0001). Correlation between slopes and the state test were weak for third and fourth grade (.21 and .14, respectively, p = .0001) and not significant for fifth grade. When ROC curves were used to identify the cut score associated with maximized sensitivity and specificity, overall accuracy was high for single points and moderate for slopes. Accuracy remained high for the cut score at the 25th and 40th percentile, though sensitivity levels were lower for the 25th percentile. Slopes yielded inadequate levels of sensitivity. Conclusion: Results suggest CATs may address issues of inadequate levels of diagnostic accuracy found in the screening literature but additional research is needed in samples with different base rates. ; Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, Department of

AB  - Alternate testing techniques have been progressively adopted as a promising solution due to their effectiveness against classical specification-based test methods. This work presents a built-in test system, which adaptively generates an indirect digital signature characterising the circuit under test, which is later used to diagnose the actual performances relying on a statistical dictionary-based diagnosis method. The system is composed of an integrated digital signature generator and a digital control and acquisition subsystem. The signature generator is based on a converter architecture, in which the analogue range can be adapted to the magnitude of the indirect measure using the well known information of the fault-free circuit. The digital subsystem controls the proposed architecture and stores the digital codes sent by the integrated digital signature generator. The digital signature generator has been designed and fabricated in an industrial 65 nm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology from STMicroelectronics, whereas the digital control and acquisition subsystem have been prototyped in a field-programmable gate array. The fabricated system has been used to test a biquad filter affected by parametric variations. Successful experimental results are reported showing the capabilities of the proposed adaptive test system to diagnose circuit performances with discrepancies as low as 1% of the actual real value. ; Postprint (published version)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk-assessments need to be validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of a highly efficient computer adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among SGMY. METHODS: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n=1,073) and at their follow-up visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity were performed. RESULTS: Younger, assigned female at birth, non-monosexual (e.g., bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender non-conforming or non-gender binary (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior wave. CONCLUSIONS: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, non-monosexual, and gender non-conforming or non-gender binary.

AB  - Background Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. Design This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Methods Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. Results On average, patients took about 1.5 minutes (SD &lt;2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal clinically important improvement. Limitations Because this study was a secondary analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future studies would benefit from more complete data. Conclusions The results indicate the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

AB  - Computer Assisted Testing (CAT) system in Indonesia has been commonly used but only to displaying random exam questions and unable to detect the maximum performance of the test participants. This research proposes a simple way with a good level of accuracy in identifying the maximum ability of test participants. By applying the Bayesian probabilistic in the selection of random questions with a weight of difficulties, the system can obtain optimal results from participants compared to sequential questions. The accuracy of the system measured on the choice of questions at the maximum level of the examinee alleged ability by the system, compared to the correct answer from participants gives an average accuracy of 75% compared to 33% sequentially. This technique allows tests to be carried out in a shorter time without repetition, which can affect the fatigue of the test participants in answering questions.

AB  - A sensitivity analysis in an observational study determines the magnitude of bias from nonrandom treatment assignment that would need to be present to alter the qualitative conclusions of a na\"{\i}ve analysis that presumes all biases were removed by matching or by other analytic adjustments. The power of a sensitivity analysis and the design sensitivity anticipate the outcome of a sensitivity analysis under an assumed model for the generation of the data. It is known that the power of a sensitivity analysis is affected by the choice of test statistic, and, in particular, that a statistic with good Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment, such as Wilcoxon's signed rank statistic, may have low power in a sensitivity analysis and low design sensitivity when compared to other statistics. For instance, for an additive treatment effect and errors that are Normal or logistic or $t$-distributed with 3 degrees of freedom, Brown's combined quantile average test has Pitman efficiency close to that of Wilcoxon's test but has higher power in a sensitivity analysis, while a version of Noether's test has poor Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment but much higher design sensitivity so it is vastly more powerful than Wilcoxon's statistic in a sensitivity analysis if the sample size is sufficiently large. ; Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/11-AOAS508 the Annals of Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)

The number of items saved and the estimated person measures was compared between the results of MCAT and NAT, respectively. Results MCAT yielded substantially more precise measurements and was considerably more efficient than NAT. MCAT achieved 20.19% (= [53 − 42.3]/53) saving in item length when the measurement differences were less than 5%. Pearson correlation coefficients were highly consistent among the eight domains. The cut-off points for the overall measures were − 1.4, − 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 logits, which was equivalent to 20% for each portion in percentile scores. Substantially fewer items were answered through MCAT than through NAT without compromising the precision of MCAT. Conclusions Developing a website that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, and smartphones to help them perform online screening and prediction of dementia in older adults is useful and manageable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design a new measure of caregiver-specific anxiety for use in caregivers of individuals with TBI, the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Specific-Anxiety item bank. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: 344 caregivers of civilians with TBI and 216 caregivers of service members/veterans with TBI. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety Item Bank RESULTS: The retention of 40 caregiver-specific anxiety items was supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning analyses supported the retention of 33 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM calibration data was used to select a 6-item static short form, and GRM calibration data was used to program the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety computer adaptive test (CAT). CONCLUSIONS: Established, rigorous measurement development standards were used to develop the new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety CAT and corresponding 6-item short form. This measure is the first patient-reported outcome measure (PRO) designed to assess caregiver-specific anxiety in caregivers of individuals with TBI. The measure exhibits strong psychometric properties.

AB  - En el presente trabajo se describen las propiedades psicométricas de un Test Adaptativo Informatizado para la medición del ajuste emocional de las personas. La revisión de la literatura acerca de la aplicación de los modelos de la teoría de la respuesta a los ítems (TRI) muestra que ésta se ha utilizado más en el trabajo con variables aptitudinales que para la medición de variables de personalidad, sin embargo diversos estudios han mostrado la eficacia de la TRI para la descripción psicométrica de dichas variables. Aun así, pocos trabajos han explorado las características de un Test Adaptativo informatizado, basado en la TRI, para la medición de una variable de personalidad como es el ajuste emocional. Nuestros resultados muestran la eficiencia del TAI para la evaluación del ajuste emocional, proporcionando una medición válida y precisa, utilizando menor número de elementos de medida en comparación con las escalas de ajuste emocional de instrumentos fuertemente implantados ; In the present work it was described the psychometric properties of an emotional adjustment computerized adaptive test. An examination of Item Response Theory (IRT) research literature indicates that IRT has been mainly used for assessing achievements and ability rather than personality factors. Nevertheless last years have shown several studies wich have successfully used IRT to personality assessment instruments. Even so, a few amount of works has inquired the computerized adaptative test features, based on IRT, for the measurement of a personality traits as it’s the emotional adjustment. Our results show the CAT efficiency for the emotional adjustment assessment so this provides a valid and accurate measurement; by using a less number of items in comparison with the emotional adjustment scales from the most strongly established questionnaires

Seit den 60-er Jahren bietet sich mit den Item-Response-Theorien (IRT) hierzu eine Alternative an, die verschiedene Vorteile verspricht. Auf ihrer Grundlage können u.a. computeradaptive Tests (CAT) entwickelt werden, welche die Auswahl der vorgelegten Items dem Antwortverhalten der Probanden anpassen und damit eine bessere Messgenauigkeit bei reduzierter Itemzahl versprechen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein CAT zur Erfassung von Stresserleben entwickelt, um zu prüfen, ob sich die theoretischen Vorzüge der IRT auch in der praktischen Umsetzung wieder finden lassen. Hierfür wurden n=1092 Patienten untersucht, die an der Medizinischen Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Psychosomatik der Charité zwischen 06/02 und 04/03 im Rahmen der Routinediagnostik ein umfangreiches Set etablierter konventioneller Fragebögen (PSQ, TICS, ABF, SUB) computergestützt beantwortet hatten.

AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD. ; M.Sc.

AB  - After the stability and sensitivity of FLOR were investigated, the application of it in the CAT environment had become the main concern. The present studies found that both the test length and the number of exposed items affect the final value of FLOR. In the fixed length CAT, the FLOR has a much stronger sensitivity than lz and CUSUM in detecting item pre-knowledge. The sensitivity of FLOR in the fixed length CAT was the same as that in the fixed length fixed items test. If the test length could vary, the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT would be slightly weakened. The Adjusted FLOR index could increase the sensitivity. Concerning about the effect of ability on the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT, it was found that the abilities of the test takers in CAT did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR and Adjusted FLOR. ; Item response theory is a modern test theory. It focuses on the performance of each item. Under this framework, the performance of test takers on a test item can be predicted by a set of abilities. The relationship between the test takers' item performances and the set of abilities underlying item performances can be described by a monotonically increasing function called an item characteristic curve. Due to various personal reasons, the performances of the test takers may depart from the response patterns predicted by the underlying test model. In order to calculate the extent of departure of these aberrant response patterns, a number of methods have been developed under the theme "person-fit statistics". The degree of aberration is calculated as an index called person-fit index. Inside the computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test takers with different abilities will answer different numbers of questions and the difficulties of the items administered to them are usually clustered at the abilities of the test takers. Due to this reason, the application of person-fit indices in the computerized adaptive testing environment to measure misfit is difficult. ; The present study also found that FLOR has a much ...

AB  - Compressor fouling is one of the main causes of gas turbine performance degradation. Microsized particles adhere to the blade surfaces increasing the surface roughness and modifying the airfoil shape. In this work, the contamination of the Allison 250 C18 multistage compressor engine with four sorts of micrometric dust has been provided. The tests were performed changing the relative humidity (RH) at the compressor inlet and the unit rotational speed. After each test, a photographic inspection of the internal fouled parts has been realized and the digital pictures have been analyzed employing an image processing package. The deposit's build-up of stator vanes and rotor blades has been postprocessed and the most affected regions of each compressor stage have been highlighted. Besides, a numerical simulation of the machine has been performed. The numerical flow field has been used to highlight the blade regions, which show the most favorable conditions for particle deposition. A theoretical model has been applied to the flow field to simulate the particle deposition. The combination of the deposition model with the results of the numerical simulations gives the chance to better understand the experimentally founded deposition patterns. Those results have been finally compared to the pictures of the patterns. The possibility to detect and measure the deposition patterns on a rotating test rig and the comparison with models and experiments gave the possibility to assess in detail the particle deposition phenomenon on a multistage axial compressor flow path.

AB  - Land-based power units have to fulfill even more high levels of production and reliability. In harsh environments (desert and tropical installations, typically), the power unit ingests high amounts of dust that might deposit inside the compressor. In this paper, the analysis of a multistage compressor performance that operates under sandy and humid conditions has been assessed. The compressor units, which equips the Allison 250 C18 compressor, has been subjected to multiple runs under severe conditions of soil dust ingestion. The compressor has been operated according to subsequent runs, and at the end of each run, the performance curve was recorded; the performance losses, in terms of pressure ratio, have been measured during the operations. The characteristic curve of each run is representative of the level of contamination of the unit. Finally, the compressor has been washed, and the performance curve, in the recovered conditions, has been recorded. The results show the modification and the downward shift of the characteristic curves which lead to a gradual loss of the compressor performance. The curves realized after dust ingestion have been compared with the recovered curve after online washing. The measurement shows a promising recovery of the performances, even if the compressor flow path appears affected by localized deposits able to resist to the droplet removal action. Detailed photographic reports of the inlet guide vane (IGV) and the first compressor stages have been included in this analysis. After each run, the IGV, the rotor blade and stator vane of the first stage, and the hub and the shroud surfaces have been photographed. The pictures show the deposition patterns on the blades and the compressor surfaces. The comparison of the pictures of the internal surfaces, before and after the washing, highlights the parts that are more critical to clean and needy of attention during offline washing and overhaul.

AB  - This study employed a quantitative research design to examine teacher assessment literacy and its relationship to external and internal factors. The researcher sought to describe the level of assessment literacy that teachers demonstrate when using score report data from computer-adaptive interim assessment and to analyze whether teachers’ assessment literacy seems to be affected by: a) the quality of professional development training received; b) teachers’ level of self-efficacy; c) teachers’ attribution to student effort, that is their perception of the importance of student effort; and d) teachers’ attribution to context, specifically their perception of the importance of tests. For this study, a relevant measurement instrument, the Assessment Literacy Skills for Computer Adaptive Tests (ALS-CAT), was designed to provide valid and reliable inferences about assessment literacy skills related to computer-adaptive tests. In addition to the ALS-CAT, the sample of 88 teachers responded to the Multidimensional Multiattributional Causality Scale (MMCS), the Data-Driven Decision-Making Efficacy Anxiety (3DMEA) inventory, and questions quantifying their perception of the quality of professional development experienced. Descriptive and explanatory correlational statistical analysis found no statistically significant relationships between respondents' scores on assessment literacy and respondents' scores on the perceived quality of professional development, perceived self-efficacy, attribution to student effort, or attribution to context. Additional analysis found a relationship between the perceived quality of professional development and perceived self-efficacy.

AB  - Gas turbine particle ingestion may lead to the deposition of contaminants in the compressor section, inducing the performance losses of the whole engine. The economic losses derived from this issue push great interest in the investigation of such a phenomenon from a numerical and experimental standpoint. This paper describes a quantitative approach to predict particle deposition on the vanes of an axial compressor starting from the flow field obtained employing CFD simulations. The results are then compared to the experiments performed on the Allison 250 C18 compressor unit subject to particle ingestion under controlled conditions. The results derived from the experimental and numerical investigations are presented, providing insight into the mass deposited on the vanes and the corresponding zones most affected by the particle deposition issue. The numerical model showed good agreement in the estimation of the predicted values of the deposited mass and the corresponding patterns through the compressor stages. The low-complexity approach proposed here, helps the designer to predict the contamination of the stationary rows starting from a simple set of single-phase numerical results. Furthermore, with the implementation of this approach into the design path, the designer could reduce the impact of fouling, looking at the effects of their solutions under the foulingreduction light.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.

AB  - Paper 106561R, 8 S. ; The Group for Quality Assurance and Industrial Image Processing has built a new experimental setup to characterize cameras and image sensors according to EMVA1288 standard. Next to the investigation of SLN (Sensitivity-Linearity- Noise) and spatial non-uniformities, the new test bench also provides an examination of the temperature dependence of sensors. The temperature dependent dark current produces an undesirable signal which affects the image quality negative and thus has to be known. It is caused by thermally induced electrons and increases linearly with exposure time as well as exponentially with temperature. To measure the dark current, it is necessary to vary and determine the temperature of the sensor. This was made possible by a climate chamber with a Peltier element, which enables a heating and cooling of the camera. An infrared sensor allows a contact-free detection of the actual camera temperature. Furthermore, the light source was improved for the new test bench. With the installed custom light source and integration sphere a homogeneous irradiation up to 97% is ensured. This way better results in tests were achieved. The light source with variable filter housing enables the use of monochromatically light in a wavelength range of 350 - 1700nm. A live monitoring of the irradiation during the image capturing is possible. A MATLAB script assists in the configuration of the camera, the measurement and the data storage. The user is guided step by step through the program. At the end of the measurements an automated evaluation follows, which illustrates graphs and parameters in a streamlined and print-ready format.

AB  - Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous studies.

AB  - Although much work has been done on computerized-adaptive test (CAT) in reducing anxiety towards exam, CAT in Malaysian educational setting is less explored among educational researchers. Some of the reason is due to technical difficulty in developing, maintaining the testing bank items, and insufficient hardware facilities for huge number of examinees in Malaysia. Hence, traditional assessment method is preferred to assess students’ performance. However, traditional assessment induced students’ anxiety towards examination. The effect of anxiety towards mathematics examination has deteriorated students’ performance particularly at polytechnics that offers technical-vocational-education-and-training (TVET). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of CAT in reducing examinees’ anxiety towards mathematics examination in comparison with traditional testing approaches at three polytechnics in northern Malaysia that offered diploma certification in engineering. These three polytechnics were chosen because it is classified as conventional and accessibility of the researchers to these samples. In order to ensure the homogeneity of the samples, students in their first year of study who enrolled in engineering mathematics were chosen. This research used quasi-experimental research method with non-equivalent control group design involving 300 students. Item-response-theory was used to describe examinees’ interaction with the test items. The results show that CAT has reduced examinees’ anxiety towards mathematics test in comparison to those of traditional testing. This study implies that CAT has benefited students in term of reducing their anxiety towards mathematics examination in the case of Malaysian polytechnics students, and has the potential to be adopted in TVET because it improves testing efficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current suicide risk screening and measurement are inefficient, have limited measurement precision, and focus entirely on suicide-related items. For this study, a psychometric harmonization between related suicide, depression, and anxiety symptom domains that provides a more balanced and complete spectrum of suicidal symptomatology was developed. The objective of this article is to describe the results of the early stages of computerized adaptive testing development for a suicide scale and pave the way for the final stage of validation. METHODS: Data from psychiatric outpatients at the University of Pittsburgh and a community health clinic were collected from January 2010 through June 2012. 789 participants were enrolled in the calibration phase; 70% were female, and 30% were male. The rate of major depressive disorder as diagnosed by DSM-5 was 47%. The item bank contained 1,008 items related to depression, anxiety, and mania, including 11 suicide items. Data were analyzed using a bifactor model to identify a core dimension between suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and mania items. A computerized adaptive test was developed via simulation from the actual complete item responses in 308 subjects. RESULTS: 111 items were identified that provided an extension of suicidality assessment to include statistically related responses from depression and anxiety domains that are syndromally associated with suicidality. All items had high loadings on the primary suicide dimension (average = 0.67; range, 0.49-0.88). Analyses revealed that a mean of 10 items (5-20) had a correlation of 0.96 with the 111-item scale, with a precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale metric. Preliminary validation data based on 290 clinician interviews revealed a 52-fold increase in the likelihood of current suicidal ideation across the range of the Computerized Adaptive Test Suicide Scale (CAT-SS). CONCLUSIONS: The CAT-SS is able to accurately measure the latent suicide dimension with a mean of 10 items in approximately 2 ...

AB  - The original publication is available at www.springerlink.com Copyright Springer [Full text of this article is not available in the UHRA] ; In a computer-adaptive test (CAT), learners are not usually allowed to revise previously entered responses. In this paper, we present findings from our most recent empirical study, which involved two groups of learners and a modified version of a CAT application that provided the facility to revise previously entered responses. Findings from this study showed that the ability to modify previously entered responses did not lead to significant differences in performance for one group of learners (p>0.05), and only relatively small yet significant differences for the other (p<0.01). The implications and the reasons for the difference between the groups are explored in this paper. Despite the small effect of the modification, it is argued that this option is likely to lead to a reduction in student anxiety and an increase in student confidence in this assessment method. ; Peer reviewed

AB  - The transonic facility of DLR Göttingen (TWG) has been modernised with respect to an improved flow quality and flow simulation, as well as to the logistics of exchangeable test sections, operational reliability and productivity. It is presently equipped with a Laval nozzle for supersonic flow measurements, a perforated test section (6% open, 60 degree slanted holes) for transonic measurements, and a two-dimensional adaptive test section for subsonic measurements. The latter can perform two-dimensinal adaptive tests on wing profiles, using the Cauchy integral formula for wall adaptation, as well as two-dimensional wall adaptation for three-dimensional models, utilising the Wedemeyer/Lamarche procedure, also known as the VKI method. For both cases, it is shown that the wall adaptation was successful. The 3D force results compare quite well to test results from the perforated test section, as well as to nominally interference-free results. The pressure distribution from the wing profile tests compare quite well to theoretical calculations. In the course of windtunnel modernisation, the transonic facility of DLR Goettingen has been equipped with the new software system DeAsfor data acquisition and control of experimental facilities. In this environment the wall adaptation programs had to be implemented. Before adjusting the computed wall shape, it has to be controlled in the loop for sufficient accuracy and tolerable bending stresses. A simplified finite element method - also taking into account the pressure loads at the wall - is used for this purpose. The simplified approach has been checked against more detailed computations using ANSYS and NASTRAN.

AB  - Computer administered tests are becoming increasingly prevalent as computer technology becomes more readily available on a large scale. For testing programs that utilize both computer and paper administrations, mode effects are problematic in that they can result in examinee scores that are artificially inflated or deflated. As such, researchers have engaged in extensive studies of whether scores differ across paper and computer presentations of the same tests. The research generally seems to indicate that the more complicated it is to present or take a test on computer, the greater the possibility of mode effects. In a computer adaptive test, mode effects may be a particular concern if items are calibrated using item responses obtained from one administration mode (i.e., paper), and those parameters are then used operationally in a different administration mode (i.e., computer). This paper studies the suitability of using parameters calibrated from a paper administration for item selection and scoring in a computer adaptive administration, for two tests with lengthy passages that required navigation in the computer administration. The results showed that the use of paper calibrated parameters versus computer calibrated parameters in computer adaptive administrations had small to moderate effects on the reliability of examinee scores, at fairly short test lengths. This effect was generally diminished for longer test lengths. However, the results suggest that in some cases, some loss in reliability might be inevitable if paper-calibrated parameters are used in computer adaptive administrations.

AB  - To efficiently obtain information about both the general abilities and detailed cognitive profiles of examinees from a single model that uses a single-calibration process, higher-order cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) that employ higher-order cognitive diagnostic models have been developed. However, the current item selection methods used in higher-order CD-CAT adaptively select items according to only the attribute profiles, which might lead to low precision regarding general abilities; hence, an appropriate method was proposed for this CAT system in this study. Under the framework of the higher-order models, the responses were affected by attribute profiles, which were governed by general abilities. It is reasonable to hold that the item responses were affected by a combination of general abilities and attribute profiles. Based on the logic of Shannon entropy and the generalized deterministic, inputs, noisy “and” gate (G-DINA) model discrimination index (GDI), two new item selection methods were proposed for higher-order CD-CAT by considering the above combination in this study. The simulation results demonstrated that the new methods achieved more accurate estimations of both general abilities and cognitive profiles than the existing methods and maintained distinct advantages in terms of item pool usage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes > .90). The P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may be a viable and efficient assessment method.

AB  - International audience ; BACKGROUND:Several Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) have been proposed to facilitate assessments in mental health. These tests are built in a standard way, disregarding useful and usually available information not included in the assessment scales that could increase the precision and utility of CATs, such as the history of suicide attempts.METHODS:Using the items of a previously developed scale for suicidal risk, we compared the performance of a standard CAT and a decision tree in a support decision system to identify suicidal behavior. We included the history of past suicide attempts as a class for the separation of patients in the decision tree.RESULTS:The decision tree needed an average of four items to achieve a similar accuracy than a standard CAT with nine items. The accuracy of the decision tree, obtained after 25 cross-validations, was 81.4%. A shortened test adapted for the separation of suicidal and non-suicidal patients was developed.CONCLUSION:CATs can be very useful tools for the assessment of suicidal risk. However, standard CATs do not use all the information that is available. A decision tree can improve the precision of the assessment since they are constructed using a priori information.

AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback–Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well.

First, psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population sample (N = 2,010) showed that the 29-item bank has psychometric properties that are required for a CAT administration. Second, a post hoc CAT simulation showed efficient and highly precise measurement, with an average number of 8.64 items for the clinical sample, and 9.48 items for the general population sample. Furthermore, the accuracy of our CAT version was highly similar to that of the full item bank administration, both in final score estimates and in distinguishing clinical subjects from persons without a mental health disorder.

AB  - Highly efficient assessments that better account for comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders (internalizing) are required to identify individuals who are most at risk of psychopathology in the community. The current study examined the efficiency and validity associated with a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure broad and specific levels of internalizing psychopathology. The sample comprised 3,175 respondents to an online survey. Items from five banks (generalized anxiety, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder) were jointly calibrated using a bifactor item response theory model. Simulations indicated that an adaptive algorithm could accurately ( rs ≥ 0.90) estimate general internalizing and specific disorder scores using on average 44 items in comparison with the full 133-item bank (67% reduction in items). Scores on the CAT demonstrate convergent and divergent validity with previously validated short severity scales and could significantly differentiate cases of DSM-5 disorder. As such, the CAT validly measures both broad and specific constructs of internalizing disorders in a manner similar to the full item bank and a static brief form but with greater gains in efficiency and, therefore, a reduced degree of respondent burden.

AB  - Importance: The most frequently used measures of facial emotion recognition (FER) are insufficiently comprehensive, reliable, valid, and efficient; moreover, the impact of gender on scoring has not been controlled. Objective: To develop a computerized adaptive test of FER for adults with schizophrenia. Design: First, we selected photographs from a published database. Second, items that fitted well to a Rasch model were used to form the item bank. Third and last, we determined the best administration mode for prospective users to achieve both high reliability and efficiency. Setting: Psychiatric hospitals and the community. Participants: Adults living with schizophrenia (n = 351) and adults without diagnosed mental illness (n = 101). Results: After removal of misfit items (infit or outfit ≥1.4), the remaining 165 items were selected to form an item bank. Among them, 39 showed severe gender bias, so the item difficulties were adjusted accordingly. On the basis of the item bank, two administration modes were recommended for prospective users. The reliable mode required approximately 128 items (nearly 20 min) to achieve reliability (.72-.81), similar to that of the entire item bank. The efficient mode required approximately 73 items (approximate 11 min) to provide acceptable reliability (.69-.73) for the seven domain scores. Conclusions and relevance: Our newly developed measure provides comprehensive, valid, and unbiased (to examinees' gender) assessments of FER in adults living with schizophrenia. In addition, the administration modes can be flexibly changed to optimize the reliability or efficiency for prospective users. What this article adds: This newly developed FER measure can help occupational therapists identify deficits in recognizing specific basic emotions and plan corresponding interventions to manage the impact on their clients' social functions.

AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing a high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adatpive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators' responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback by solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Follow-up of stroke survivors is important to objectify activity limitations and/or participations restrictions. Responsive measurement tools are needed with a low burden for professional and patient. AIM: To examine the concurrent validity, floor and ceiling effects and responsiveness of both domains of the Late-Life Function and Disability Index Computerized Adaptive Test (LLFDI-CAT) in first-ever stroke survivors discharged to their home setting. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Community. POPULATION: First ever stroke survivors. METHODS: Participants were visited within three weeks after discharge and six months later. Stroke Impact Scale (SIS 3.0) and Five-Meter Walk Test (5MWT) outcomes were used to investigate concurrent validity of both domains, activity limitations, and participation restriction, of the LLFDI-CAT. Scores at three weeks and six months were used to examine floor and ceiling effects and change scores were used for responsiveness. Responsiveness was assessed using predefined hypotheses. Hypotheses regarding the correlations with change scores of related measures, unrelated measures, and differences between groups were formulated. RESULTS: The study included 105 participants. Concurrent validity (R) of the LLFDI-CAT activity limitations domain compared with the physical function domain of the SIS 3.0 and with the 5MWT was 0.79 and -0.46 respectively. R of the LLFDI-CAT participation restriction domain compared with the participation domain of the S1S 3.0 and with the 5MWT was 0.79 and -0.41 respectively. A ceiling effect (15%) for the participation restriction domain was found at six months. Both domains, activity limitations and participation restrictions, of the LLFDI-CAT, scored well on responsiveness: 100% (12/12) and 91% ( I 2/11) respectively of the predefined hypotheses were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The LLFDI-CAT seems to be a valid instrument and both domains are able to detect change over time. Therefore, the LLFD-CAT is a promising tool to use both in practice and in ...

AB  - Papers in this third volume deals with the Covid-19 pandemic which is having an enormous impact on education systems worldwide. Policy makers, teachers, school managers, parents and students have been called to the reinvent their way of ‘doing school’. At the same time, the governance of the education system and schools’ organizations have been exposed to unprecedented tensions. The pandemic emergency has been a lens revealing intersections and structural tensions among various level and actors of the education system, but also allowing opportunities of changes thanks to the exogenous shock. At the same time, it must be considered that the emergency is interacting on pre-existing inequalities and contradictions. Higher education systems have been affected too: in constant evolution due to constant transformations of society and changed functions of knowledge, universities have undergone a structural change along with pandemic times. Simultaneously, the growing relevance of knowledge for the economic development of the capitalistic system has profoundly affected higher education systems, characterized by the neo-liberal approach which his subject of increasing critical analysis. ; In this paper we present results on the estimation of mathematics skills of Italian grade 10 students with special educational needs. The estimation was carried out by means of a com-puter based multilevel adaptive test 1 - 3 - 3 (MST) constructed within the framework of a doctoral research in Social, Developmental and Educational Research Psychology. An item bank was used to construct the MST test. Verification of the unidimensionality of the bank was done through exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and analysis of model fit indices with Rasch's model (Rasch, 1960) being calibrated. Verification of the best measurement properties of the test compared to a linear test was performed by comparing information functions. It is shown that this type of test is able to provide estimates of the ability of students with a con-siderable level of ...

It is known that the power of a sensitivity analysis is affected by the choice of test statistic, and, in particular, that a statistic with good Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment, such as Wilcoxon’s signed rank statistic, may have low power in a sensitivity analysis and low design sensitivity when compared to other statistics. For instance, for an additive treatment effect and errors that are Normal or logistic or t-distributed with 3 degrees of freedom, Brown’s combined quantile average test has Pitman efficiency close to that of Wilcoxon’s test but has higher power in a sensitivity analysis, while a version of Noether’s test has poor Pitman efficiency in a randomized experiment but much higher design sensitivity so it is vastly more powerful than Wilcoxon’s statistic in a sensitivity analysis if the sample size is sufficiently large. A new exact distribution-free test is proposed that rejects if either Brown’s test or Noether’s test rejects after adjusting the two critical values so the overall level of the combined test remains at α, conventionally α = 0.05. In every sampling situation, the design sensitivity of the adaptive test equals the larger of the two design sensitivities of the component tests. The adaptive test exhibits good power in sensitivity analyses asymptotically and in simulations. In one sampling situation—Normal errors and an additive effect that is three-quarters of the standard deviation with 500 matched pairs—the power of Wilcoxon’s test in a sensitivity analysis was 2% and the power of the adaptive test was 87%. A study of treatments for ovarian cancer in the Medicare population is discussed in detail.

AB  - BackgroundWith the increasingly rapid growth of the elderly population, individuals aged 65years and above now compose 14% of Taiwanese citizens, thereby making Taiwanese society an aged society. A leading factor that affects the elderly population is dementia. A method of precisely and efficiently examining patients with dementia through multidimensional computer adaptive testing (MCAT) to accurately determine the patients' stage of dementia needs to be developed. This study aimed to develop online MCAT that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, or smartphones to predict the extent of dementia for patients responding to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) instrument.MethodsThe CDR was applied to 366 outpatients in a hospital in Taiwan. MCAT was employed with parameters for items across eight dimensions, and responses were simulated to compare the efficiency and precision between MCAT and non-adaptive testing (NAT). The number of items saved and the estimated person measures was compared between the results of MCAT and NAT, respectively.ResultsMCAT yielded substantially more precise measurements and was considerably more efficient than NAT. MCAT achieved 20.19% (=[53-42.3]/53) saving in item length when the measurement differences were less than 5%. Pearson correlation coefficients were highly consistent among the eight domains. The cut-off points for the overall measures were -1.4, -0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 logits, which was equivalent to 20% for each portion in percentile scores. Substantially fewer items were answered through MCAT than through NAT without compromising the precision of MCAT.ConclusionsDeveloping a website that family members can use on their own computers, tablets, and smartphones to help them perform online screening and prediction of dementia in older adults is useful and manageable.

AB  - Emotion knowledge in children includes emotion recognition in other peoples' faces, as well as understanding the internal and external causes and consequences of emotions and strategies for regulating them. To date, there is no measure in the German-speaking countries that captures emotion knowledge in a differentiated but also reliable and valid way. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM) aims to close this gap. The ATEM follows an adaptive design and six components of emotion knowledge. The 32 Rasch-scaled items are embedded in an attractive story and vary in their difficulty within and between the components. In a sample of 581 3 - 9-year-olds, the test showed a good fit to a six-dimensional model and very good psychometric properties. In a subsample of 254 3 - 5-year-olds, correlations between the ATEM and a measure of emotion knowledge and measures of expressive and receptive language abilities demonstrated good validity. The ATEM proved to be a good measure of emotion knowledge in children. ; Das Emotionswissen von Kindern umfasst neben dem Ablesen von Emotionen aus Gesichtern anderer Menschen auch das Erkennen von externalen und internalen Ursachen von Emotionen sowie das Wissen über ihre Konsequenzen und Regulationsmöglichkeiten. Im deutschsprachigen Raum gibt es bisher kein Testverfahren, welches das Emotionswissen auf diese Weise differenziert und gleichzeitig reliabel und valide erfasst. Mit dem Adaptiven Test des Emotionswissens (ATEM) wird diese Lücke geschlossen. Der ATEM fragt in einem adaptiven Design 6 Teilaspekte des Emotionswissens ab, wobei die 32 Items in eine kinderfreundliche Geschichte eingebettet sind. Der nach der Item-Response-Theorie aufgebaute Test zeigt mit einer Gesamtstichprobe von N = 581 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 9 Jahren gute psychometrische Eigenschaften. In einer Substichprobe von n = 254 Kindern im Alter zwischen 3 und 5 Jahren wurde der ATEM anhand von Korrelationen mit verschiedenen Variablen validiert. Insgesamt eignet sich der ATEM gut zur differenzierten Messung des Emotionswissens bei Kindern.

Auf ihrer Grundlage können u.a. computeradaptive Tests (CAT) entwickelt werden, welche die Auswahl der vorgelegten Items dem Antwortverhalten der Probanden anpassen und damit eine bessere Messgenauigkeit bei reduzierter Itemzahl versprechen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein CAT zur Erfassung von Stresserleben entwickelt, um zu prüfen, ob sich die theoretischen Vorzüge der IRT auch in der praktischen Umsetzung wieder finden lassen. Hierfür wurden n=1092 Patienten untersucht, die an der Medizinischen Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Psychosomatik der Charité zwischen 06/02 und 04/03 im Rahmen der Routinediagnostik ein umfangreiches Set etablierter konventioneller Fragebögen (PSQ, TICS, ABF, SUB) computergestützt beantwortet ...

AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms etal., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial ( |.30|) correlations. The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested.

AB  - Objectives Measure quality of life (QoL) outcomes using a novel computerised adaptive test in a clinical setting, and determine the social and demographic factors associated with specific QoL domains in patients with glaucoma. Design Cross-sectional study between July 2020 and April 2021. Participants English-speaking adults presenting to glaucoma clinic. Patients with cognitive impairment on a six-item cognitive impairment screen or with intraocular surgery within 90 days prior to presentation were excluded. Results Of 206 patients surveyed, mean age was 64.8 years (SD 15.2), 122 (56.7%) were female and 159 (74.7%) were white. On multivariable regression, visual acuity was associated with greater activity limitation (β=−2.8 points, 95% CI −3.8 to –1.8, p&lt;0.001) and worse mobility (β=−2.1 points, 95% CI −3.2 to –0.9, p&lt;0.001), while poorer visual field (VF) mean deviation was associated with lower scores on the emotional well-being domain (β=−2.4 points, 95% CI −4.6 to –0.3, p=0.03). Glaucoma suspects and those with early VF defects had higher QoL scores than those with severe glaucoma in the following domains: activity limitation (88.5±14.6 vs 74.3±21.9, respectively, p&lt;0.001), mobility (91.0±12.5 vs 80.0±25.3, respectively, p=0.005) and concerns domains (82.2±13.9 vs 72.5 5±18.9, respectively, p=0.01). Conclusions In a busy glaucoma clinic where QoL was measured with online adaptive tests for glaucoma, we found that several demographic and clinical variables are associated with lower domain scores, suggesting that patients with predisposing demographic and clinical factors are at a higher risk of worse QoL.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The assessment of recovery from burn injury is critical to improving pediatric health. However, there is a lack of brief, burn-specific measures to assess preschool-aged burn survivors’ health outcomes. We developed items pools for a new, parent-reported computer adaptive test based assessment of preschool-aged children’s burn outcomes. Methods Initial item pools were informed by the Preschool LIBRE Conceptual Model based on the International Classification for Children (ICF) and the Burn Outcomes Questionnaires (BOQ 0–5) and generated from a review of existing instruments assessing health and developmental outcomes in children 1–5 years. Candidate items underwent a review process to bin items together based on the underlying construct they assessed. Items were then winnowed down and further refined based on clinical expert consensus meetings. The winnowing process focused on ensuring items assessed abilities and behaviors that could be reliably determined by parent report, were age-relevant, and focused on health and developmental concepts that are important in the assessment of children’s burn recovery. To ensure item quality, we conducted parent cognitive interviews. In final reviews, we standardized item recall periods, response options, verb tense, and literacy demands. Results A total of 9,509 items were identified and extracted. Four item pool domains were established: communication and language development (42 items), physical functioning (53 items), psychological functioning (56 items), and social functioning (37 items). The respective item pools aim to assess: children’s ability to receive meaning and produce language; children’s gross and fine motor abilities; children’s emotions and behavior (internalizing and externalizing behaviors, dysregulation, toileting, response to trauma and resilience); and children’s social participation and abilities. Recall period and response options were refined for consistency for all 188 final items. Conclusions Four item pools were developed assessing four domains 1) communication and language development, 2) physical functioning, 3) psychological functioning and 4) social functioning for preschool-aged children. The item pools are currently being field-tested for the calibration and validation of the Preschool LIBRE CAT Profile. Applicability of Research to Practice This work is relevant to researchers and practitioners evaluating the effects of burn injury on preschool-aged children’s health and developmental outcomes.

AB  - Public Significance Statement This study suggests that PROMIS CATs for Depression and Anxiety measure the same constructs as matching BSI subscales in Dutch adult patients treated for common mental disorders, are at least as able to detect change over time, and categorize the change scores of more patients as actually changed. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients.We evaluated construct validity, responsiveness, and utility of change indicators of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS adult v1.0 item banks for Depression and Anxiety administered as computerized adaptive test (CAT). Specifically, the CATs were compared to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) using pre- and re-test data of adult patients treated for common mental disorders (N = 400; median pre-to-re-test interval = 215 days). Construct validity was evaluated with Pearson's correlations and Cohen's ds; responsiveness with Pearson's correlations and pre-post effect sizes (ES); utility of change indicators with kappa coefficients and percentages of (dis)agreement. The results showed that the PROMIS CATs measure similar constructs as matching BSI scales. Under the assumption of measuring similar constructs, the CAT and BSI Depression scales were similarly responsive. For the Anxiety scales, we found a higher responsiveness for CAT (ES = 0.64) compared to the BSI (ES = 0.50). Finally, both CATs categorized the change scores of more patients as changed compared to matching BSI scales, indicating that the PROMIS CATs may be more able to detect actual change than the BSI. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement over matching BSI scales as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients. We discuss several additional differences between the PROMIS CATs and the BSI to help test users choose instruments. These differences include the adopted measurement theory (Item Response Theory vs. Classical Test Theory), the mode of administration (CAT vs. fixed items), and the area of application (universal vs. predominantly clinical). ; Stress-related psychiatric disorders across the life span

AB  - text ; Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners’ speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper–and–pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real–time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two–parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test–takers’ severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20–item simulated fixed–length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test. The computerized adaptive test to assess severity levels of English speaking anxiety proved consistent with the psychometric evidence that suggests that it is feasible to score a single index from the newly constructed anxiety inventory using IRT methods and that this single index score can be compared on common metrics across all items in the item pool. Thus, assessment of speaking anxiety based on CAT may contribute to designing syllabus by establishing an individualized teaching. ; Curriculum and Instruction
