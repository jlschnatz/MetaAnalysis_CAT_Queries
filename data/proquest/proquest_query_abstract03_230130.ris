T1  - Development of a set of patient reported outcome measures for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts: patient focus groups and systematic review
AN  - 2748664452
AB  - BackgroundPatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be useful for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts (BLTC) to evaluate the impact of treatment and/or guide shared decision making. Yet, a set of PROMs relevant to patients with BLTC is currently unavailable. In this study, we selected a PROMs set for patients with BLTC.MethodsPotentially relevant patient reported outcomes (PROs) were selected by psychologist-researchers based on keywords used or suggested by participants of two virtual focus groups meetings consisting of thirteen female BLTC patients with a median age of 50 years. Subsequently, patients were asked to report their most relevant PROs. PROMs identified by systematic literature review and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) were considered in selecting the final PROMs set to assess relevant outcomes.ResultsThe most important PROs were: insecurity/anxiety (11/12 patients), pain (9/12 patients), fatigue (8/12 patients), and limitations in daily life (5/12 patients). The literature review included 23 studies, which used various generic and disease-specific PROMs, often not measuring (all) relevant PROs. The final selected PROMs set included numerical rating scales for pain, two questions on overall health and quality of life and four PROMIS CATs.ConclusionsA PROMs set generically and efficiently measuring outcomes relevant for patients with BLTC was developed and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

T1  - Computer adaptive testing to assess impairing behavioral health problems in emergency department patients with somatic complaints
AN  - 2729945609
AB  - ObjectivesTo assess: (1) the prevalence of mental health and substance use in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through use of a computer adaptive test (CAT‐MH), (2) the correlation among CAT‐MH scores and self‐ and clinician‐reported assessments, and (3) the association between CAT‐MH scores and ED utilization in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment.MethodsThis was a single‐center observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED for somatic complaints (97%) from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes were computer‐adaptive‐assessed domains of suicidality, depression, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We conducted Pearson correlations and logistic regression for objectives 2 and 3, respectively.ResultsFrom a sample of 794 patients, the proportion of those at moderate/severe risk was: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). CAT‐MH domains were highly correlated with self‐report assessments (r = 0.49–0.79). Individuals who had 2 or more ED visits in the prior year had 62% increased odds of being in the intermediate‐high suicide risk category (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–2.44) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. Individuals who scored in the intermediate‐high‐suicide risk group had 63% greater odds of an ED visit within 30 days after enrollment compared to those who scored as low risk (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.44).ConclusionThe CAT‐MH documented that a considerable proportion of ED patients presenting for somatic problems had mental health conditions, even if mild. Mental health problems were also associated with ED utilization.

T1  - Automated Speech Audiometry for Integrated Voice Over Internet Protocol Communication Services
AN  - 2717146391
AB  - Purpose: Problems in speech recognition are often apparent in telecommunication situations. For ecologically valid assessments of such conditions, it is important to quantify the impact of real environments including acoustic conditions at a far-end communication device and all paths of transmission degradation. This study presents an automated matrix sentence test procedure based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) integrated in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure and compares the individual effects of transmission degradations with results from laboratory measurements. Method: Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in 16 normalhearing subjects in four test conditions: (a) a laboratory condition guided by a human experimenter, (b) a laboratory condition with reduced bandwidth and (c) additionally reduced headset quality to simulate typical communication systems, and (d) an automated, ASR-controlled adaptive test procedure over a real VoIP infrastructure. Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and "laboratory" conditions, with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.

T1  - The Impact of Local Item Dependence on Computer Adaptive Testing Given Between and Within Testlet Adaptivity
AN  - 2729529785
AB  - In educational tests, a group of questions related to a shared stimulus is called a testlet (e.g., a reading passage with multiple related questions). Use of testlets is very common in educational tests. Additionally, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a mode of testing where the test forms are created in real time tailoring to the test taker's previous responses. CATs have gained popularity because they produce a more accurate test score estimate within a shorter time with fewer questions. In this dissertation, the performance of CAT with testlets was studied. 
Conditional independence is an essential assumption of Item Response Models. However, when testlets are used, item responses to the items in the same testlet may not be independent since these items are associated with a common stimulus. In this case, the conditional independence assumption is violated, and this violation can affect the entire performance of CAT and lead to inaccurate test scores. 
Common practice for testlet based CATs is to select a testlet adaptively and administer all the items bundled in the testlet. However, the accuracy and efficiency aspects of CAT may not be fully realized with this approach of adaptivity. To increase the accuracy and efficiency in testlet-based CATs, between and within testlet adaptivity was studied. Other manipulated variables were the level of adaptivity, different testlet/item selection approaches, latent trait estimation methods, test length/number of testlets, and magnitude of testlet dependence. The performances of testlet based CATs with various scenarios were evaluated descriptively by running a series of simulations. One of the important findings of the study is that not only between testlets but also within testlets adaptation improved the performance of the CAT for more accurate and precise estimation of the latent traits. The results will serve as a baseline for future research and practice.

T1  - Psychometric Performance of a Condition-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument for Dutch Children Born with Esophageal Atresia
AN  - 2728451966
AB  - A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL©) to assess quality of life of children born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance in Dutch children. After Swedish–Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old children, 8/17 items had >5% missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual child’s situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in different countries are needed.

T1  - Improving Test Security and Efficiency of Computerized Adaptive Testing for the Force Concept Inventory
AN  - 2722551713; EJ1343470
AB  - This paper presents improvements made to a computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-based version of the FCI (FCI-CAT) in regards to test security and test efficiency. First, we will discuss measures to enhance test security by controlling for item overexposure, decreasing the risk that respondents may (i) memorize the content of a pretest for use on the post-test or (ii) share information about the items with their classmates who take the assessment later. Second, we will discuss measures to enhance test efficiency, so that a shorter test length can yield a desired accuracy and precision of the measurement. Specifically, we utilized collateral information in the form of a pretest proficiency estimate of each respondent for selecting items and estimating respondent proficiency level in the post-test. To shorten the total testing time further, we also allowed the test lengths to be different for the pre- and post-test. To analyze how these improvements affect the accuracy and precision (which we measure in terms of root-mean-square error) of Cohen's d, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation and a "post hoc" simulation. Then, we calculated the minimal test length of the FCI-CAT whose accuracy and precision are equivalent to that of the paper-and-pencil version of the FCI. Consequently, we obtained the following three findings: (i) By using collateral information, we can achieve the accuracy and precision of the full-length FCI with fewer items via the FCI-CAT. (ii) For a class size of 40, we can control for test security while still reducing the sum of the pre- and post-test lengths of the FCI-CAT to a total of 33 items (17 items on the pretest and 16 items on the post-test), thereby reducing the testing time to 55%. (iii) If one's goal is to maximize test efficiency, the pretest length should be slightly larger than the post-test length. On the other hand, if the goal is to maximize test security, the pretest length should be smaller and the post-test length should be larger. If one desires a balance of these two goals, it would be reasonable to choose equal pre- and post-test lengths.

T1  - Developing a Web-Based App to Assess Mental Health Difficulties in Secondary School Pupils: Qualitative User-Centered Design Study
AN  - 2624025081
AB  - Background: Secondary schools are an ideal setting to identify young people experiencing mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression. However, current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment.
Objective: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools.
Methods: This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cycles—an initial stakeholder consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed.
Results: Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for designing mental health assessment apps are also provided.
Conclusions: Artemis-A is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training. Future research will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Artemis-A in a range of UK secondary schools.

T1  - Item Characteristic Curve Asymmetry: A Better Way to Accommodate Slips and Guesses than a Four-Parameter Model?
AN  - 2608863707; EJ1317106
AB  - Four-parameter models have received increasing psychometric attention in recent years, as a reduced upper asymptote for item characteristic curves can be appealing for measurement applications such as adaptive testing and person-fit assessment. However, applications can be challenging due to the large number of parameters in the model. In this article, we demonstrate in the context of mathematics assessments how the slip and guess parameters of a four-parameter model may often be empirically related. This observation also has a psychological explanation to the extent that both asymptote parameters may be manifestations of a single item complexity characteristic. The relationship between lower and upper asymptotes motivates the consideration of an asymmetric item response theory model as a three-parameter alternative to the four-parameter model. Using actual response data from mathematics multiple-choice tests, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of a three-parameter asymmetric model in several standardized tests of mathematics. To the extent that a model of asymmetry ultimately portrays slips and guesses not as purely random but rather as proficiency-related phenomena, we argue that the asymmetric approach may also have greater psychological plausibility.

T1  - Psychometric Properties of the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory in a Nationally Representative Sample of Youth
AN  - 2583230001
AB  - Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Scientific Standards and refined through factor analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI’s psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth.Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI’s structure and psychometric properties.Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences.Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

T1  - Applying Item Response Theory to the OPD Structure Questionnaire: Identification of a Unidimensional Core Construct and Feasibility of Computer Adaptive Testing
AN  - 2564184059
AB  - Recent developments in the dimensional assessment of personality functioning have made the implementation of latent measurement models increasingly attractive. In this study, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a well-established personality functioning instrument (the OPD Structure Questionnaire) to identify a unidimensional latent trait and to evaluate the feasibility of computer adaptive testing (CAT). We hypothesized that the use of IRT could reduce the test burden – compared to a fixed short form – while maintaining high precision over a wide range of the latent trait. The OPD-SQ was collected from 1235 patients in a psychosomatic clinic. IRT assumptions were fulfilled. A 9-factor model yielded sufficient fit and unidimensionality in exploratory factor analysis with bifactor rotation. Items were iteratively reduced, and a graded-response IRT model was fitted to the data. Simulations showed that a CAT with approximately 7 items was able to capture an OPD-SQ global severity score with an accuracy similar to that of a fixed 12-item short form. The final item bank and CAT yielded satisfactory content validity. Strong correlations with depression and anxiety replicated previous results on the OPD-SQ. We concluded that IRT applications could be useful to reduce the test burden of personality functioning instruments.

T1  - Development and validation of computerized adaptive assessment tools for the measurement of posttraumatic stress disorder among US military veterans
AN  - 2553796755; 1572666
AB  -   IMPORTANCE: Veterans from recent and past conflicts have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5. RESULTS: Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r = 0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r = 0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic screening and severity measurement are possible. [Author Abstract]

AB  - Objective: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk assessments need to be validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of a highly efficient computerized adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among SGMY. Methods: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n = 1,073) and at their follow-up visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity were performed. Results: Younger, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual (e.g., bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender nonconforming or nongender binary (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior wave. Conclusions: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for the identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual, and gender nonconforming or nongender binary.

T1  - Estimating Psychometric Properties of Computerized Multistage Testing
AN  - 2572971681
AB  - In recent decades, computerized multistage testing (MST) has been utilized as an alternative testing mode for large-scale testing programs. Although the usage of MST has been discussed extensively, there is little literature that addresses its psychometric properties. The motivation of this dissertation arises from the need to properly estimate psychometric properties under the MST framework. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrated set of formulas for estimating psychometric properties for MST, including error variance, reliability, and classification indices. To achieve this goal, existing methods that are used for the traditional P\&P tests are extended to the MST context, if possible; and new methods are proposed based on the characteristics of MST (i.e., routing probability) for the ML and EAP estimators. For the ML estimator, a conventional approach to computing MST test information analytically is also included for estimating the psychometric properties. The proposed approach and the conventional approach are then applied to a single set of MST data, with varied conditions. Further, a simulation approach is employed for the purpose of understanding and comparing the performance of the proposed approach and conventional approach. In the simulation approach, replications of test data are used to obtain results.
The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) for the ML estimator, the proposed analytic approach performed better than the conventional approach, indicated by comparing their results with those from the simulation approach; (2) for the EAP estimator, results from using the Bayesian approach approach led to smaller values of marginal error variances and higher values of reliability, compared with the quadrature approach; (3) longer test resulted in decreased error variances and improved reliability; (4) for the EAP Bayesian approach, increasing sample size had a limited impact on the estimation results; (5) for all the approaches, conditional classification consistency and accuracy gradually decreased when the ability parameter was moving further away from the cut scores. All of the estimation formulas provided in this dissertation can be applied directly to MST data in practice.

T1  - Evaluation of the measurement properties of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) in Hispanic caregivers to patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders
AN  - 2448808299
AB  - Objectives:The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used measure of perceived stress; however, minimal psychometric evaluation has been performed among Hispanic respondents, and even less among Hispanic caregivers to persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRDs).Design:Secondary data analysis.Setting:New York City, NY, USA.Participants:A sample of 453 community dwelling Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD.Measurements:Latent variable models were used to evaluate the PSS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine unidimensionality. Differential item functioning (DIF) was examined for age, education, and language using the graded item response model.Results:The factor and bifactor analyses results supported essential unidimensionality of the item set; however, positively worded items were observed using response item theory to be less informative than the negatively worded items. Reliability estimates were high. Salient DIF was not observed for age, education, or language of interview using the primary DIF detection method. Sensitivity analyses using a second DIF detection method identified uniform language-DIF for the item, “In the last month, how often have you felt that you were on top of things?” However, the non-compensatory DIF value was below the threshold considered salient.Conclusions:In summary, the 10-item PSS performed well in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. Very little DIF, and none of high magnitude and impact, was observed. However, the negatively worded items, perhaps because they are more directly reflective of stress, were more informative. In the context of a short-form measure or computerized adaptive test, more informative items are those that would be selected for inclusion.

T1  - Development of a computerized adaptive substance use disorder scale for screening and measurement: the CAT‐SUD: (Alcoholism and Drug Addiction)
AN  - 2411430799
AB  - Background and aimsThe focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multi‐dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risk‐taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the item‐bank, (2) calibrate the item‐bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptom‐specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CAT‐SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain.DesignItem bank construction, item calibration phase, CAT‐SUD validation phase.SettingPrimary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patient‐to‐patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles).Participants/casesCalibration phase: the CAT‐SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CAT‐SUD.MeasurementsA total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CAT‐SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis.FindingsCalibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multi‐dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168‐item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100‐point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CAT‐SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20‐fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CAT‐SUD (AUC = 0.85).ConclusionsWe have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multi‐dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CAT‐SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

T1  - Stopping Rules for Computer Adaptive Testing When Item Banks Have Nonuniform Information
AN  - 2400034544
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

T1  - Classification and Regression Tree and Computer Adaptive Testing in Cardiac Rehabilitation: Instrument Validation Study
AN  - 2737517712
AB  - Background: There is a need for shorter-length assessments that capture patient questionnaire data while attaining high data quality without an undue response burden on patients. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods have the potential to meet these needs and can offer attractive options to shorten questionnaire lengths.
Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT or CART was best suited to reduce the number of questionnaire items in multiple domains (eg, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and social support) used for a needs assessment procedure (NAP) within the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) without the loss of data quality.
Methods: NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a Web-based portal, MyCARDSS, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
Results: With CAT and CART, an overall reduction of 36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length, respectively, was achieved, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT, 0.777 and 0.877 for classification trees, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees, respectively.
Conclusions: Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the NAP used within the field of CR. CART, however, showed the best performance, with a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress in multiple domains. For CR professionals, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their patients by providing real-time patient measurements.

T1  - <strong>Assessment of Fatigue in Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease:</strong> Validation of PROMIS Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test and Identifying Correlates of Fatigue in Patients with End-Stage Kdney Disease
AN  - 2466269139
AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD.

T1  - Stopping Rules for Computer Adaptive Testing When Item Banks Have Nonuniform Information
AN  - 2459005490; EJ1254419
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the "SE" is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the "SE" threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the "SE" stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

T1  - Comparison of patient-reported outcomes measurement information system and legacy instruments in multiple domains among older veterans with chronic back pain
AN  - 2444064198
AB  - Background 
Chronic low back pain (cLBP) results in significant physical, psycho-social and socioeconomic burden. Identifying efficient and reliable patient reported outcome measures is critical for research and clinical purposes. The NIH’s Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments have not been compared to validated “legacy” instruments in older adults with cLBP. This study evaluates construct (convergent and discriminant) validity and time to complete (TTC) PROMIS as compared to legacy instruments.
 Methods 
We enrolled older Veterans (age 60+) with cLBP with/without leg pain scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Subjects completed PROMIS computer adaptive test item banks and corresponding legacy instruments in the following domains: pain intensity, interference, and behavior; functional status; depression and anxiety; fatigue; sleep and social functioning. Convergent and discriminant validity between PROMIS and legacy instruments was evaluated using Spearman rank order correlations; Mann-Whitney U tests compared TTC.
 Results 
Of the 71 Veterans recruited, the median (IQR) age was 67 (63–71) years old, 94% were men, 76% were White, 17% Black, and 96% were Non-Hispanic. Spearman correlations between PROMIS and legacy instruments showed moderate to very strong convergent validity in all domains (r = 0.4–1.0), except for social functioning and pain behavior (PROMIS Pain Behavior with Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire). The total median TTC for all PROMIS items was significantly shorter than legacy items, 8 min 50 s vs 29 min 14 s respectively, p < 0.001.
 Conclusions 
Given time efficiency of using PROMIS, along with strong construct validity, PROMIS instruments are a practical choice for measuring multidimensional PROs in older Veterans with cLBP for both research and clinical purposes.

T1  - Are student nurses ready for new technologies in mental health? Mixed-methods study
AN  - 2338151433
AB  - Background Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. Method Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. Results We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.

T1  - Detection of Cognitive Change: Examination of Approaches for Improving The Accuracy on Impact
AN  - 2303324792
AB  - Concussion is an increasingly recognized public health concern. Proper assessment and management of concussion are critical factors in mitigating adverse effects associated with this injury. Neuropsychological assessment has demonstrated utility in identifying cognitive symptoms related to concussion and monitoring their resolution. Early methods involved administering paper and pencil tests to appraise cognitive domains thought to be most affected by concussion. As interest in concussion and methods of assessment evolved, baseline testing became an integral component of assessment in sport-related concussion (SRC). Baseline testing consists of administering a healthy, or non-injured, individual a battery of cognitive tests that subsequently serve as a reference point to evaluate the individual’s performance on the same tests following a suspected injury or change in cognitive status. Recent advances, spurred by an interest in increasing access to baseline testing, contributed to the adoption of computerized neurocognitive tests (CNTs). CNTs allow for baseline testing of groups of individuals, in one setting, and in a short amount of time. Immediate Post Concussion and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) has emerged as the most commonly used CNT in the assessment and management of SRC. This body of research aimed to explore ImPACT’s reliability and validity to appraise its efficacy in accurately detecting cognitive change associated with concussion and explore potential improvements. The first chapter is devoted to examining ImPACT’s test-retest reliability, which refers to the expected consistency in results over time in healthy individuals. This study examines ImPACT score reports for 107 healthy individuals that included testing at two time points. Results reveal less than adequate test-retest reliability attributable to, at least in part, a restricted range of possible scores, or the presence of a ceiling effect, on numerous subscales. Additional discussion includes corrective measures, such as proactively identifying individuals producing maximum scores on baseline testing, extending the length of subscales, and incorporating adaptive testing. The second chapter evaluates ImPACT’s validity, and specifically, its classification accuracy in differentiating between individuals with and without concussion. This study incorporates a novel approach through its use of standardized regression based (SRB) reliable change index (RCI) scores to measure post-injury testing deviations from baseline scores. The SRB methodology, coupled with discriminant function analyses (DFAs), is compared to current interpretive procedures. The study includes 129 individuals without concussion whose SRB RCI scores are compared to 81 individuals with concussion. Results of analyses suggest that the current interpretive procedure performs at a chance level in accurately identifying individuals with concussion; conversely, the SRB method and DFA approach yield positive predictive values exceeding 80%, however sensitivities below 50%. Additionally, the Post Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), a self-report measure of symptoms, is largely equivalent to ImPACT’s cognitive measures in classification accuracy. Collectively, these results raise considerable concern regarding ImPACT’s efficacy as a measure to aid in the assessment and management of concussion.

T1  - Calibration of an item bank in 474 orthopedic patients using Rasch analysis for computer-adaptive assessment of anxiety
AN  - 2281774362
AB  - Objective:To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test.Design:This is a psychometric study.Setting:The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany.Subjects:A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study.Interventions:Not applicable.Main measures:The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients.Results:The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item–trait interaction (χ2(203) = 172.59; P = .94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits).Conclusion:The unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

T1  - Computerized Quality of Life Assessment: A Randomized Experiment to Determine the Impact of Individualized Feedback on Assessment Experience
AN  - 2269958634
AB  - Background Quality of life (QoL) assessments, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), are becoming increasingly important in health care and have been associated with improved decision making, higher satisfaction, and better outcomes of care. Some physicians and patients may find questionnaires too burdensome; however, this issue could be addressed by making use of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In addition, making the questionnaire more interesting, for example by providing graphical and contextualized feedback, may further improve the experience of the users. However, little is known about how shorter assessments and feedback impact user experience. Objective We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the impact of tailored multimodal feedback and CAT on user experience in QoL assessment using validated PROMs. Methods We recruited a representative sample from the general population in the United Kingdom using the Oxford Prolific academic Web panel. Participants completed either a CAT version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-CAT) or the fixed-length WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100. We randomly assigned participants to conditions in which they would receive no feedback, graphical feedback only, or graphical and adaptive text-based feedback. Participants rated the assessment in terms of perceived acceptability, engagement, clarity, and accuracy. Results We included 1386 participants in our analysis. Assessment experience was improved when graphical and tailored text-based feedback was provided along with PROMs (Δ=0.22, P<.001). Providing graphical feedback alone was weakly associated with improvement in overall experience (Δ=0.10, P=.006). Graphical and text-based feedback made the questionnaire more interesting, and users were more likely to report they would share the results with a physician or family member (Δ=0.17, P<.001, and Δ=0.17, P<.001, respectively). No difference was found in perceived accuracy of the graphical feedback scores of the WHOQOL-CAT and WHOQOL-BREF (Δ=0.06, P=.05). CAT (stopping rule [SE<0.45]) resulted in the administration of 25% fewer items than the fixed-length assessment, but it did not result in an improved user experience (P=.21). Conclusions Using tailored text-based feedback to contextualize numeric scores maximized the acceptability of electronic QoL assessment. Improving user experience may increase response rates and reduce attrition in research and clinical use of PROMs. In this study, CAT administration was associated with a modest decrease in assessment length but did not improve user experience. Patient-perceived accuracy of feedback was equivalent when comparing CAT with fixed-length assessment. Fixed-length forms are already generally acceptable to respondents; however, CAT might have an advantage over longer questionnaires that would be considered burdensome. Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between assessment length, feedback, and response burden in diverse populations.

T1  - Integrating PROMIS® computerized adaptive tests into a web-based intervention for prostate cancer
AN  - 2222645398
AB  - Objective: This study outlined the implementation and feasibility of delivering PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) using a web-based method to evaluate the impact of a technological adaptation of Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) on the psychosocial functioning of men with advanced prostate cancer (APC) undergoing hormone therapy. Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS® CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS® domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS® anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS® CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

T1  - Relationship Between PROMIS Computer Adaptive Tests and Legacy Hip Measures Among Patients Presenting to a Tertiary Care Hip Preservation Center
AN  - 2234586780
AB  - Background:Legacy hip outcome measures may be burdensome to patients and sometimes yield floor or ceiling effects. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) allow for low-burden data capture and limited ceiling and floor effects.Purpose/Hypothesis:The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PROMIS CAT domains demonstrate correlation against commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The authors hypothesized the following: (1) PROMIS CAT scores based on physical function (PF), pain interference (PIF), pain behavior, and pain intensity would show strong correlation with the following legacy scores: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), International Hip Outcome Tool–12 (iHOT-12), Hip Outcome Score (HOS) Sports and Activities of Daily Living subscales, and Veterans RAND–6D (VR-6D) utility measure. (2) The mental and physical health portions of the VR-6D legacy measure would show weak correlation with mental- and psychosocial-specific PROMIS elements—depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. (3) All PROMIS measures would exhibit fewer floor and ceiling effects than legacy scores.Study Design:Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Prospective data were collected on 125 patients in the hip preservation clinics. Enrollees completed legacy scores (visual analog scale for pain, mHHS, iHOT-12, HOS, and VR-6D) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (PF, PIF, pain behavior, anxiety, depression, sleep, social roles and activities, pain intensity, fatigue). Spearman rank correlations were calculated, with rs values of 0 to 0.3 indicating negligible correlation; 0.3 to 0.5, weak correlation; 0.5 to 0.7, moderately strong correlation; and >0.7, strong correlation. Floor and ceiling effects were evaluated.Results:As anticipated, the PF-CAT yielded strong correlations with the iHOT-12, mHHS, HOS–Sports, HOS–Activities of Daily Living, and VR-6D, with rs values of 0.76, 0.71, 0.81, 0.87, and 0.71, respectively. The PIF-CAT was the only pain score to show moderately strong to strong correlation with all 14 patient-reported outcome measures. A strong correlation was observed between the VR-6D and the social roles and activities CAT (rs = 0.73). The depression CAT had a significant floor effect at 19%. No additional floor or ceiling effect was present for any other legacy or PROMIS measure.Conclusion:The PF-CAT shows strong correlation with legacy patient-reported outcome scores among patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The PIF-CAT also correlates strongly with legacy and PROMIS measures evaluating physical and mental well-being. PROMIS measures are less burdensome and demonstrate no floor or ceiling effects, making them a potential alternative to legacy patient-reported outcome measures for the hip.

T1  - Performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF Procedures in a Computerized Multistage Testing Environment
AN  - 2647707280
AB  - This study investigates the performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF procedures independently and in comparative terms in a computerized multistage testing (MST) environment. A simulation study was conducted to mimic an operational testing environment. Three factors that may typically affect DIF detection in an MST environment were manipulated – sample size (250, 500), impact (0, 0.5, 1) and DIF magnitude (0.45, 0.9). A fourth factor (DIF method) was included at the analysis stage to understand its effect on the outcomes. The criteria for evaluating the results were Type I error rates and power rates. Results reveal that MH has better control of Type I error rates across various study conditions. With respect to power, MH was more powerful in detecting large DIF for the large sample size condition (power rate of 1.00) compared to CATSIB, which had power rates between .84 and 1.00 under the same conditions. Regression results reveal that there were interaction effects of the study factors on Type I error rates and power rates. These results will guide practitioners on best practices regarding DIF detection procedures under various conditions in computerized MST environments. This research adds to the extant literature that promotes psychometric methods that can assist in ensuring that operational test scores are aligned with the principals of item-level statistical fairness.

T1  - Adult Learning across USA, Canada, and New Zealand: A Cross-Cultural Study of PIAAC
AN  - 2461117162; EJ1214292
AB  - Skeptics of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trend for International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) argue that while US elementary and high school students are behind their peers in other nations, the US workforce is still excellent because of the high quality post-secondary educational institutions in the US. However, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) indicates that US adults are in fact far behind their international peers in literacy, numeracy, and technology-based problem solving. Through the use of data mining, this study explored the possible association between PIAAC scores and several constructs. Since the US, Canada, and New Zealand were considered culturally similar nations, according to cluster analysis, patterns between PIAAC scores and selected constructs were analyzed by a variety of big data analytical methods, including cluster analysis, bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and data visualization. Given that PIAAC used multiple computerized adaptive testing, the consequential plausible values were randomly selected when the ensemble approach was used. Additionally, model comparison was utilized to decide between bagging and boosting in order to select the optimal model for each sample. In these samples, cultural engagement, readiness to learn, and social trust, respectively emerged as strong predictors for learning outcomes as they were assessed by PIAAC.

T1  - Optimizing Design of Incorporating Off-Grade Items for Constrained Computerized Adaptive Testing in K-12 Assessment
AN  - 2305945464
AB  - Incorporating off-grade items within an on-grade item pool is often seen in K-12 testing programs. Incorporating off-grade items may provide improvements in measurement precision, test length, and content blueprint fulfillment, especially for high- and low-performing examinees, but it may also identify some concerns when using too many off-grade items on tests that are primarily designed to measure grade-level standards. This dissertation investigates how practical constraints such as the number of on-grade items, the proportion, and range of off-grade items, and the stopping rules affect item pool characteristics and item pool performance in adaptive testing.This study includes simulation conditions with four study factors: (1) three on-grade pool sizes (150, 300, and 500 items), (2) three proportions of off-grade items in the item pool (small, moderate, and large), (3) two ranges of off-grade items (one grade level and two grade levels), and (4) two stopping rules (variable- and fixed-length stopping rule) with two SE threshold levels. All the results are averaged across 200 replications for each simulation condition.The item pool characteristics are summarized using descriptive statistics and histograms of item difficulty (the b-parameters), descriptive statistics and plots of test information functions (TIFs), and the standard errors of the ability estimate (SEEs). The item pool performance is evaluated based on the descriptive statistics of measurement precision, test length and exposure properties, content blueprint fulfillment, and mean proportion of off-grade items for each test.The results show that there are some situations in which incorporating off-grade items would be beneficial. For example, a testing organization with a small item pool attempting to improve item pool performance for high- and low-performing examinees. The results also show that practical constraints of incorporating off-grade items, organized here from most impact to least impact in item pool characteristics and item pool performance, are: 1) incorporating off-grade items into small baseline pool or large baseline pool; 2) broadening the range of off-grade items from one grade level to two grade levels; 3) increasing the proportion of off-grade items in the item pool; and 4) applying variable- or fixed-length CAT. The results indicated that broadening the range of off-grade items yields improvements in measurement precision and content blueprint fulfillment when compared to increasing the proportion of off-grade items. This study could serve as guidance for test organizations when considering the benefits and limitations of incorporating off-grade items into on-grade item pools.

T1  - Exam Anxiety: Using Paired Adaptive Tests to Reduce Stress in Business Classes
AN  - 2228651872; EJ1203830
AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

T1  - Comparison of two test methods for VIS: paper-pencil test and CAT
AN  - 2112006727
AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

T1  - Predictors of health-related quality of life in chronically ill children and adolescents over time
AN  - 2088836455
AB  - Objective This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. Methods Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; aged 7–17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. Results Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. Conclusions HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

T1  - Accuracy of the of the PROMIS-57 questionnaire to identify significant depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients on hemodialysis
AN  - 2088794123
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone© crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

T1  - Correlation of PROMIS CAT instruments with Oswestry Disability Index in chiropractic patients
AN  - 2088124940
AB  - Background The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Methods All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. Results The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170 ± 67 s (average ± Stdev) to answer 25 ± 6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R2 values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R2 values of 0.5236. Conclusions PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

T1  - Improving Assessment of Work Related Mental Health Function Using the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB)
AN  - 2006744623
AB  - Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security Administration’s (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood & emotions, resilience, social interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition & communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental health subdomains: Cognition & Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 items), Resilience & Sociability (29 items) and Mood & Emotions (34 items). All scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational rehabilitation settings.

T1  - Large-Scale Multiple Hypothesis Testing and Simultaneous Inference: Compound Decision Theory and Data Driven Procedures
AN  - 2408568105
AB  - Two-sample multiple testing has a wide range of applications. The conventional practice first reduces the original observations to a vector of p-values and then chooses a cutoff to adjust for multiplicity. However, this data reduction step could cause significant loss of information and thus lead to suboptimal testing procedures. In this thesis, I present a new framework for two-sample multiple testing by incorporating a carefully constructed auxiliary variable in inference to improve the power. A data-driven multiple testing procedure is developed by employing a covariate-assisted ranking and screening (CARS) approach that optimally combines the information from both the primary and auxiliary variables. The proposed CARS procedure is shown to be asymptotic valid and optimal for false discovery rate (FDR) control. The procedure is implemented in the R-package CARS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of CARS in FDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. CARS is also illustrated through an application to the analysis of satellite imaging data set for supernova detection.
In addition to the aforementioned two-sample multiple testing problem, multistage designs have been used in a wide range of scientific fields as well. By allocating sensing resources adaptively, one can effectively eliminate null locations and localize signals with a smaller study budget. We formulate a decision-theoretic framework for simultaneous multistage adaptive testing and study how to minimize the total number of measurements while meeting pre-specified constraints on both the false positive rate (FPR) and missed discovery rate (MDR). The new procedure, which effectively pools information across individual tests using a simultaneous multistage adaptive ranking and thresholding (SMART) approach, can achieve precise error rates control and lead to great savings in total study costs. Numerical studies confirm the effectiveness of SMART for FPR and MDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. The SMART procedure is demonstrated through the analysis of high-throughput screening data and spatial imaging data.
I also discuss ongoing and future research directions in this thesis, particularly on the topics of online FDR control and structured multiple testing. For applications, I discuss in detail on using online FDR control for real time anomaly detection for user engagement metrics at Snap Inc.

T1  - Comparison of Two Test Methods for VIS: Paper-Pencil Test and CAT
AN  - 2155996241; EJ1192194
AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

T1  - Predicting Certification Success for the Family Nurse Practitioner
AN  - 2050014573
AB  - High-stakes licensure or certification examinations are required for many health professions disciplines to ensure safe entry-level practice. Accrediting agencies set a benchmark for graduates’ first-time licensure or certification success as a measure of program effectiveness. Failures of graduates on licensure or certification examinations may directly affect the school’s recruitment and retention of qualified students and faculty, as well as institutional financial viability. A health science university has added Health Education System, Inc. (HESI) standardized examinations using computer adaptive testing into the family nurse practitioner (FNP) master’s program to support certification success, although research on these advanced practice examinations as related to certification outcomes was lacking. Guided by classical test theory, this study was an investigation of whether a relationship existed between students’ performance on 4 HESI standardized examinations (Advanced Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacotherapeutics, Advanced Health Assessment, and the APRN/FNP Exit exam) and first-time FNP certification success. Binary logistic regression analysis of data from 117 students who graduated between 2013–2016 indicated that none of the 4 standardized HESI examinations significantly predicted FNP certification success, perhaps due to the examinations not carrying any evaluative weight within the program. The results of this project study may be used to promote positive social change by providing a means to improve first-time certification success and increasing the availability of primary care providers in the role of FNP.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing in Pediatric Brain Tumor Clinics
AN  - 1963430746
AB  - Context: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. Objective: This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. Methods: Patients (ages 7-22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. Results: Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

T1  - Examining the Construct Validity of the MMPI-2-RF Interpersonal Functioning Scales Using the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder as a Comparative Framework
AN  - 1911185698
AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms et al., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial ([greater than or equal to] |.30|) correlations. The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested.

T1  - Online Tools for Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation Among Graduate Students and Clinicians
AN  - 1978490262
AB  - Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice (EBBP) is a transdisciplinary systematic approach that emphasizes the use of best evidence in combination with clinical expertise, as well as patient preferences and values, to make clinically-informed decisions about care and treatment (Spring, 2007). Despite numerous benefits and strong policy support of EBBP, findings indicate that clinicians generally fail to implement EBBP in standard clinical practice due to a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and low self-efficacy associated with an absence of resources.    To address the need for EBBP resources and tools, Bonnie Spring, PhD and colleagues developed a theory-driven website for graduate students and clinicians. The website is primarily comprised of two components: nine interactive training modules and a novel assessment portal that utilizes patient-reported computer adaptive tests (CATs). To date, the training modules and assessment portal have not been evaluated, and there is currently a critical need to incorporate mixed methods evaluations into EBBP implementation science. The goal of this dissertation is to contribute to the ongoing evaluation and optimization of the EBBP Project by conducting summative and implementation-focused formative evaluations of its training modules and assessment portal.     Aim 1 evaluated changes in user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy for each EBBP module and determined whether these outcomes varied by user characteristics, including degree, professional discipline, and number of completed modules. Together, findings suggested heightened interest and use of asynchronous, web-based training modules about EBBP in social work and psychology, and that these modules can produce short-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about EBBP. Overall, however, attrition continues to be a challenge.    To better understand the attrition rates of the EBBP training modules and web-based modules, in general, Aim 2 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics related to module engagement. Overall, findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses (i.e., mixed method analyses) revealed that specific instructional guidance and interactive features, coupled with user technical knowledge, are particularly important characteristics that may improve engagement in asynchronous web-based training modules.   Given the novelty of the EBBP assessment portal, Aim 3 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics associated with its engagement and implementation. Results from mixed method analyses suggested that user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy, coupled with programmatic functions to ensure privacy and confidentiality of patient information, may be important characteristics to improving engagement with a CATs-based assessment portal.    In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information on the short-term effectiveness of asynchronous web-based modules, and factors that may contribute to engagement and implementation of online training and clinical tools for EBBP.

T1  - Aberrant response detection using change-point analysis
AN  - 1874567901
AB  - Aberrant responses, which are caused by examinees' unusual behaviors (e.g., carelessness, speededness, item pre-knowledge, warm-up, copying answers from neighbors), are frequently seen in various testing programs. Having aberrant responses may bias item parameter estimates and threaten test validity. Thus proper modeling and detection of aberrant responses is crucial both theoretically and practically in educational and psychological measurement.    Previous work has primarily approached the aberrant responses research in terms of developing person fit statistics and proposing models to capture the aberrant behaviors. This dissertation attempts to incorporate change-point analysis (CPA) to investigate two types of aberrant responses: speededness and warm-up effect; both of which can be viewed as having an abrupt change point. This is an extension work of Shao, Li, and Cheng (in press) which first introduced the CPA method to detect test speededness with known item parameters. Following this line of research, three studies are carried out.    The first study investigates whether CPA can help improve item calibration in the presence of speededness. In this study, the CPA method is used to first detect speeded responses with unknown item parameters. After the detection of speeded examinees as well as their corresponding speeding point (the point at which an examinee starts to speed), a cleansing procedure based upon the detected speeding point is proposed to help improve item parameter estimation. The performance of speededness detection as well as the item parameter recovery before/after utilizing the cleansing procedure are evaluated.    The second study applies the CPA method to warm-up effect detection. This study first compares the impact of warm-up effect on ability estimation and examinees' classification accuracy on two types of tests: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Paper and Pencil (linear) Testing. In the second step, the CPA based detection of warm-up effect is carried out. Two methods of obtaining the critical values are utilized in the study.    Different from the first two studies which both conduct CPA using item response information, the third study applies CPA to response time data in speededness detection. A gradual change log-normal model is proposed to better model the real-life change of response time affected by speededness. Two test statistics are introduced to test for a change point using response time. Moreover, this study explores the possibility of using a fixed critical value across conditions at each nominal level so that practitioners do not have to obtain a critical value through simulation every time they run speededness detection.    The dissertation thesis concludes with the final chapter including a discussion of the results, limitations, practical implications, and future directions.

T1  - Development and validation of a computerized-adaptive test for PTSD (P-CAT)
AN  - 1935255325; 48556
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes >.90). The P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may be a viable and efficient assessment method.

T1  - Investigating Robustness of Item Response Theory Proficiency Estimators to Atypical Response Behaviors under Two-Stage Multistage Testing. ETS GRE® Board Research Report. ETS GRE®-16-03. ETS Research Report No. RR-16-22
AN  - 1895976126; EJ1124833
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which item response theory (IRT) proficiency estimation methods are robust to the presence of aberrant responses under the "GRE"® General Test multistage adaptive testing (MST) design. To that end, a wide range of atypical response behaviors affecting as much as 10% of the test items were simulated using a generic GRE 2-stage MST and the 2-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model. As expected, some differences were found among the 5 estimators in terms of the recovery of the true theta ability; for example, Bayesian estimators had lower error variance and their estimates were regressed to the mean.Once the IRT theta estimates were scaled onto a comparable reporting score scale, however, it was found that all the estimation methods investigated, including the one currently used to score GRE MSTs, were equally robust under the simulated conditions.

T1  - Improving Binary Classifier Performance Through an Informed Sampling Approach and Imputation
AN  - 1928416028
AB  - In the last two decades or so, some of the substantial advances in machine learning relate to sampling techniques. For example, boosting uses weighted sampling to improve model training, and active learning uses unlabeled data gathered so far to decide what are the most relevant data points to ask an oracle to label. This thesis introduces a novel sampling technique that uses features entropy to guide the sampling, a process we call  informed sampling. The central idea is that the reliability of model parameter learning may be more sensitive to variables that have low, or high entropy. Therefore, adapting the sampling rate of variables based on their entropy may lead to better parameter estimates.    In a series of papers, we first test this hypothesis for three classifier models, Logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and over a binary classification task with a 0–1 loss function. The results show that the high-entropy sampling (higher sampling rate for high entropy variables) systematically improves the prediction performance of the TAN classifier. However, for the NB and LR classifiers, the picture is more blurry. Improvements are obtained for only half of the 11 datasets used, and often the improvements come from high-entropy sampling, seldom from low-entropy sampling. This first experiment is replicated in a second study, this time using a more realistic context where the entropy of variables is unknown a priori, but instead is estimated with seed data and adjusted on the fly. Results showed that using a seed dataset of 1% of the total number of instances, which ranged from a few hundreds to around 1000, the improvements obtained from the former study hold for TAN with an average improvement of 13% in RMSE reduction. For the same seed size improvements were also obtained for the Naive Bayes classifier by a factor of 8% from low instead of high entropy sampling. Also, the pattern of improvements for LR was almost the same as obtained from the former study.    Notwithstanding that classifier improvements can be obtained through informed sampling, but that the pattern of improvements varies across the informed sampling approach and the classifier model, we further investigate how the imputation methods affect this pattern. This question is of high importance because informed sampling necessarily implies missing values, and many classifiers either require the imputation of missing values, or can be improved by imputation. Therefore imputation and informative sampling are likely to be combined in practice. The obvious question is whether the gains obtained from each are additive or if they relate in a more complex manner.    The gain from imputation methods are first studied in isolation with a comparative analysis of the performance of some new and some well known imputation algorithms, with the objective of determining to which extent the pattern of improvements is stable across classifiers for the binary classification and 0–1 loss function. Here too, results show that patterns of improvement of imputation algorithms can vary substantially per model and also per missing value rate. We also investigate the improvements along a different dimension which is whether the rate of sampling per record is stable or varies. Minor, but statistically significant differences are observed in the results, showing that this dimension can also affect classifier performance.    In a final paper, first the levels of improvement from informed sampling are compared with those from a number of imputation techniques. Next, we empirically investigate whether the gains obtained from sampling and imputation are additive, or they combine in a more complex manner. The results show that the individual gains from informed sampling and imputation are within the same range and that combining high-entropy informed sampling with imputation brings significant gains to the classifiers' performance, but generally, not as a simple sum of the individual improvements. It is also noteworthy that despite the encouraging results for some combinations of informed sampling and imputation algorithms, detailed analysis of individual dataset results reveals that these combinations rarely bring classification performance above the top imputation algorithms or informed sampling by themselves.    The results of our studies provide evidence of the effectiveness of informed sampling to improve the binary classification performance of the TAN model. Also, high-entropy sampling is shown to be the most preferable scheme to be conducted. This for example, in the context of Computerized Adaptive Testing, can be translated to favoring the highly uncertain questions (items of average difficulty). Variable number of items administered is another factor that should be taken into account when imputation is involved.  Alternative Kurzfassung:Au cours des deux dernières décennies, des progrès importants dans le domaine de l'apprentissage automatique ont été réalisés grâce à des techniques d'échantillonnage. Relevons par exemple le renforcement (boosting), une technique qui assigne des poids aux observations pour améliorer l'entraînement du modèle, ainsi que la technique d'apprentissage actif qui utilise des données non étiquetées partielles pour décider dynamiquement quels cas sont les plus pertinents à demander à un oracle d'étiqueter.Cette thèse s'inscrit dans ces recherches et présente une nouvelle technique d'échantillonnage qui utilise l'entropie des données pour guider l'échantillonnage, un processus que nous appelons l'échantillonnage informé. L'idée centrale est que la fiabilité de l'estimation des paramètres d'un modèle peut dépendre de l'entropie des variables. Donc, l'adaptation du taux d'échantillonnage de variables basée sur leur entropie peut conduire à de meilleures estimations des paramètres.Dans une série d'articles, nous étudions cette hypothèse pour trois modèles de classification, notamment Régression Logistique (LR), le modèle bayes naïf (NB) et le modèle d'arbre bayes naif (TAN—Tree Augmented Naive Bayes), en prenant une tâche de classification binaire avec une fonction d'erreur 0–1. Les résultats démontrent que l'échantillonnage d'entropie élevée (taux d'échantillonnage plus élevé pour les variables d'entropie élevée) améliore systématiquement les performances de prédiction du classificateur TAN. Toutefois, pour les classificateurs NB et LR, les résultats ne sont pas concluants. Des améliorations sont obtenues pour seulement la moitié des 11 ensembles de données utilisées et souvent les améliorations proviennent de l'échantillonnage à entropie élevée, rarement de l'échantillonnage à entropie faible.Cette première expérience est reproduite dans une deuxième étude, cette fois en utilisant un contexte plus réaliste où l'entropie des variables est inconnue à priori, mais plutôt estimée avec des données initiales et où l'échantillonnage est ajusté à la volée avec les nouvelles estimation de l'entropie.Les résultats démontrent qu'avec l'utilisation d'un ensemble de données initial de 1% du nombre total des exemplaires, qui variait de quelques centaines à environ 1000, les gains obtenus de l'étude précédente persistent pour le modèle TAN avec une amélioration moyenne de 13% dans la réduction l'erreur quadratique. Pour la même taille des semences, des améliorations ont également été obtenues pour le classificateur naïf bayésien par un facteur de 8% de l'entropie faible au lieu d'échantillonnage d'entropie élevée.L'échantillonnage informé implique nécessairement des valeurs manquantes, et de nombreux classificateurs nécessitent soit l'imputation des valeurs manquantes, ou peuvent être améliorés par imputation. Par conséquent, l'imputation et l'échantillonnage informatif sont susceptibles d'être combinés dans la pratique. La question évidente est de savoir si les gains obtenus de chacun sont additifs ou s'ils se rapportent d'une manière plus complexe. Nous étudions dans un premier temps comment les méthodes d'imputation affectent la performance des classificateurs puis si la combinaison de techniques d'imputation avec l'échantillonnage informé apporte des gains qui se cumulent.Le gain de méthodes d'imputation sont d'abord étudiés isolément avec une analyse comparative de la performance de certains nouveaux algorithmes et d'autres algorithmes d'imputation bien connus avec l'objectif de déterminer dans quelle mesure le motif des améliorations est stable dans les classificateurs pour la classification binaire. Ici encore, les résultats montrent que les améliorations obtenues par des techniques d'imputation peuvent varier considérablement par modèle et aussi par taux de valeur manquante. Nous étudions également les améliorations le long d'une autre dimension qui est de savoir si le taux d'échantillonnage par enregistrement est stable ou varie. Des différences mineures, mais statistiquement significatives sont observées dans les résultats, montrant que cette dimension peut également affecter les performances du classificateur.Dans une dernière étude, nous étudions empiriquement si les gains obtenus de l'échantillonnage informé et de l'imputation sont additifs, ou s'ils se combinent d'une manière plus complexe. Les résultats montrent que les gains individuels de l'échantillonnage informé et d'imputation sont du même ordre de grandeur, mais en général, ils ne sont pas une simple somme des améliorations individuelles. Il faut noter aussi que, malgré les résultats encourageants pour certaines combinaisons d'échantillonnage informées et des algorithmes d'imputation, une analyse détaillée des résultats de l'ensemble de données individuelles révèle que ces combinaisons apportent rarement des performances supérieures aux algorithmes d'imputation ou à l'échantillonnage informé individuellement.Les résultats de nos études fournissent une démonstration de l'efficacité de l'échantillonnage informé pour améliorer les performances de classification binaire pour le modèle TAN, mais les résultats sont plus mitigés pour NB et LR. En outre, l'échantillonnage à entropie élevée se révèle être le régime le plus bénéfique.

T1  - Methods for Hypothesis Testing in Animal Carcinogenicity Experiments
AN  - 1830448193
AB  - Animal carcinogenicity experiments are conducted by private entities and government agencies to investigate whether a substance causes cancer. Since most tumors are occult and it is necessary to conduct a necropsy to detect the presence of cancer, producing unbiased tests for differences in tumor incidence is challenging. The highest doses given in these experiments often have toxic effects in the animals or might affect tumor lethality, and many common statistical methods for survival data perform poorly when such effects induce differences in mortality across treatment groups. The poly- k test, developed by Bailer & Portier (1988) as a modification of the Cochran-Armitage test, was designed to avoid problems from differential mortality, but is based on strong parametric assumptions, specifically that underlying tumor hazard may be modeled as Weibull with shape parameter  k (usually set to 3). Existing literature that examines the performance of the poly-k and competitor tests assumes Weibull tumor hazards, and finds that the poly-k can be biased under treatment toxicity when its shape parameter assumption is not met. Given that this test has become a standard for government agencies such as the National Toxicology Program and the FDA, closer examination is warranted. Our simulations examine the performance of the poly-k under non-Weibull tumor hazards, and find that our own parametric tests can outperform it under these conditions. For tests like the poly-k, our goal is to develop and examine the performance of adaptive testing algorithms that estimate a test's parameter based on the data; one such estimation was suggested under Weibull assumptions by Moon et al. (2003), though their approach based on estimating lifetime cumulative tumor incidence rates does not make full use of the available data, and requires that the experiment include multiple interim sacrifices for adequate performance. Under most of our simulation settings, our kˆ MLE test, based on estimating the shape parameter  k by maximizing the full likelihood, has type I error and power very similar to the poly-k test with correctly-specified  k, and it maintains size better, with comparable or higher power, than the test based on the Moon et al. estimate. Our MLE-based test does not require interim sacrifices, although it may perform better under some interim sacrifice experimental designs. We compare these tests under a variety of parametric assumptions and serial sacrifice designs to examine which experimental settings are most optimal for test performance.

T1  - Non-parametric item response theory applications in the assessment of dementia
AN  - 1857763144
AB  - This thesis sought to address the application of non-parametric item response theory (NIRT) to cognitive and functional assessment in dementia. Performance on psychometric tests is key to diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. NIRT can be used to improve the psychometric properties of tests used in dementia assessment in multiple ways: confirming an underlying unidimensional structure, establishing formal item hierarchical patterns of decline, increasing insight by examining item parameters such as difficulty and discrimination, and creating shorter tests. From a NIRT approach item difficulty refers to the ease with which an item is endorsed. Discrimination is an index of how well an item can differentiate between patients of varying levels of severity. Firstly I carried out a systematic review to identify applications of both parametric and non-parametric IRT to measures assessing global cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This review demonstrated that IRT can increase the interpretive power of cognitive assessment scales and confirmed the limited number of IRT analyses of cognitive scales in dementia populations. This thesis extended this approach by applying Mokken scaling analysis to commonly used measures of current cognitive ability (Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)) and of premorbid cognitive ability (National Adult Reading Test (NART)). Differential item functioning (DIF) by diagnosis identified slight variations in the patterns of hierarchical decline in the ACE-R. These disease-specific sequences of decline could serve as an adjunct to diagnosis, for example where learning a name and address is a more difficult task than being orientated in time, late onset Alzheimer’s disease is a more probable diagnosis than mixed Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. These analyses also allowed key items to be identified which can be used to create briefer scales (mini-ACE and Mini-NART) which have good psychometric properties. These scales are clinically relevant, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items. They also allow sensitive measurement and adaptive testing and can reduce test administration time and patient stress. Impairment of functional abilities represents a crucial component of dementia diagnosis with performance on these functional tasks predictive of overall disease. A second aspect of this thesis, therefore, was the application of Mokken scaling analyses to measures of functional decline in dementia, specifically the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS). While gender DIF was observed for several items, implying the likelihood of equal responses from men and women is not equal a generally consistent pattern of impairment in functional ability was observed across different types of dementia.

T1  - Recent stress history effects in clays and associated improvements to the brick model
AN  - 1827521410
AB  - It is known that the stiffness of many soils is higher at small strains than at the large strains used in typical triaxial testing. Understanding this initial high stiffness and the factors affecting it is key to accurate displacement predictions. The recent stress history (RSH) effect describes how the stiffness degradation curve at small strains is affected by the immediately preceding stress path. The effect is usually described in terms of stress path rotation angle between an approach path and the shear probe upon which stiffness degradation is measured. The principle aim of the work was to investigate the relationship between the RSH effect, approach path length, and time dependent effects in more detail. A combination of physical testing and simulations with the BRICK constitutive model were used to achieve this. This has shown that in multistage testing the residual RSH effect from the first test increased the stiffness exhibited in the second, thus masking the natural behaviour. In addition the stress path rotation from consolidation to testing caused a stiffness reduction in the first test. This effect, newly termed recent consolidation history (RCH), was found to be degraded by the first test and so did not impact on the second. When allowance was made for these effects trends seen in the literature were supported. Due to the complex stress paths used in the physical testing, a number of improvements were required to the strain rate dependent (SRD) BRICK model to allow accurate simulations to be run. These included implementation of a bisecting iteration within the strain calculations, and a coordinate decent routine to allow creep and creep rupture to be modelled. The model was then used to simulate the physical tests to allow more insight into the interplay between the effects identified in the physical testing, ultimately supporting the conclusions drawn.

T1  - New group testing paradigms: From practice to theory
AN  - 1751005379
AB  - We propose a novel group testing framework, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome screening experiments in addition to other applications such as interpretable rule learning for decision making. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an integer-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a unifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing models are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the notion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable test matrices, representing generalizations of classical disjunct and separable matrices. We describe combinatorial and probabilistic constructions for such matrices without considering any restriction on the thresholds of the SQGT model (i.e. SQGT with arbitrary thresholds). Then, we focus on the important special case in which the thresholds are equidistant, and construct SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable matrices for this model. While for most of the constructions described in this dissertation, it is assumed that the number of defectives is much smaller than total number of test subjects, we also consider the case in which there is no restriction on the number of defectives and they may be as large as the total number of subjects. For the constructed matrices, we describe a number of efficient decoding algorithms based on algebraic methods and message passing on graphical models. Finally, we introduce the novel probabilistic group testing framework of Poisson group testing, applicable to dynamic testing with diminishing relative rates of defectives. For this new model, we consider both nonadaptive and adaptive testing schemes and develop lower bounds and tight constructive upper bounds on the number of required tests.

T1  - Comparing the Effect of Two Types of Computer Screen Background Lighting on Students' Reading Engagement and Achievement
AN  - 1650526779; 201500650
AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

T1  - Validation of the depression item bank from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(TM)) in a three-month observational study
AN  - 1558993257; 201431254
AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(TM)) is an NIH Roadmap initiative devoted to developing better measurement tools for assessing constructs relevant to the clinical investigation and treatment of all diseases-constructs such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, sleep, physical functioning, and social participation. Following creation of item banks for these constructs, our priority has been to validate them, most often in short-term observational studies. We report here on a three-month prospective observational study with depressed outpatients in the early stages of a new treatment episode (with assessments at intake, one-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up). The protocol was designed to compare the psychometric properties of the PROMIS depression item bank (administered as a computerized adaptive test, CAT) with two legacy self-report instruments: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999). PROMIS depression demonstrated strong convergent validity with the CESD and the PHQ-9 (with correlations in a range from .72 to .84 across all time points), as well as responsiveness to change when characterizing symptom severity in a clinical outpatient sample. Identification of patients as 'recovered' varied across the measures, with the PHQ-9 being the most conservative. The use of calibrations based on models from item response theory (IRT) provides advantages for PROMIS depression both psychometrically (creating the possibility of adaptive testing, providing a broader effective range of measurement, and generating greater precision) and practically (these psychometric advantages can be achieved with fewer items-a median of 4 items administered by CAT-resulting in less patient burden).

T1  - Portuguese-language cultural adaptation of the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
AN  - 1692279184; 201507261
AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), structured in Itens Banks, provides a new tool for evaluating results that apply to various chronic diseases through advanced statistical techniques (TRI) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The aim of this study was to culturally adapt the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of PROMIS to the Portuguese language. The process followed the recommendations of PROMIS through the advanced translation, reconciliation, back-translation, FACIT review, independent review, finalization, pre-test, and incorporation of the results from the pre-test. The translated version was pre-tested in ten patients, and items 3, 46, and 53 of the Bank of Anxiety and item 46 of the bank of Depression had to be changed. Changes affected equivalence of meaning, and the final version was consistent with the Brazilian population's linguistic and cultural skills. In conclusion, for the Brazilian population the translated version proved semantically and conceptually equivalent to the original. Adapted from the source document

T1  - Deep massage to posterior calf muscles in combination with neural mobilization exercises as a treatment for heel pain: A pilot randomized clinical trial
AN  - 1680436212; 20064139
AB  - Background: Plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS) is a common foot disorder; however, there is limited clinical evidence on which to base treatment. Repeated clinical observations indicating heel pain during heel rise and minisquat on the affected leg, involving activation of posterior calf muscles, formed the basis of this study. Objective: To compare deep massage therapy to posterior calf muscles and neural mobilization with a self-stretch exercise program (DMS) to a common treatment protocol of ultrasound therapy to the painful heel area with the same self-stretch exercises (USS). Methods: Patients with PHPS were assigned to a program of 8 treatments over a period of 4-6 weeks in a single-blind randomized clinical trial. Functional status (FS) at admission and discharge from therapy as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was the main outcome measure. Results: Sixty-nine patients were included in the trial (mean age 53, standard deviation (SD) 13, range 25-86, 57% women), 36 received DMS treatment and 33 with USS. The overall group-by-time interaction for the mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was found statistically significant (p = 0.034), with a change of (mean (confidence interval, CI)) 15 (9-21) and 6 (1-11) FS points for the DMS and USS groups, respectively. Conclusions: Data indicated that both treatment protocols resulted in an overall short-term improvement, however, DMS treatment was significantly more effective in treating PHPS than USS treatment.

T1  - The EORTC emotional functioning computerized adaptive test: phases I-III of a cross-cultural item bank development
AN  - 1531918641; 201413633
AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

T1  - Comparing the Effect of Two Types of Computer Screen Background Lighting on Students' Reading Engagement and Achievement
AN  - 1871572088; ED568528
AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

T1  - Designing <i>p</i>-Optimal Item Pools for Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 1615091454
AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the  p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context.   The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24  p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature.   Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

T1  - Student Perceptions of Barriers to Success on the Nursing Exit Exam
AN  - 1566941687
AB  - Nursing programs increasingly use exit exams to increase graduating nursing students' readiness for the nurse licensing examination. These exams prepare students for computer adaptive testing and identify areas where remediation is needed. This study examines an Associate Degree in Nursing program that has shown consistently low exit exam scores causing delays in student graduation, eligibility to sit for the licensing exam, and entry into the workforce. The study was crafted to investigate student perspectives of the barriers to student success on the Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) exit exam. It employed a quantitative one-shot survey design to evaluate factors related to performance on the HESI exit exam, including lack of study time, lack of knowledge despite passing nursing courses, lack of motivation to prepare for the exam, overwhelming stress, poor test-taking skills, and lack of confidence. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that students' self-perceptions of poor test-taking skills had a significant negative effect on HESI exit exam scores. These findings were used to design a project focused on teaching test-taking skills throughout the nursing program. The study and project collectively promote positive social change by providing a means to improve nursing program graduation rates, a tool of great importance in addressing the current shortage of nurses in the United States' workforce.

T1  - Statistical Methods in Genetic Association Studies and a Genetic Risk Score for Predictive Modeling of Disease Risk: from Gene Discovery to Translation
AN  - 1554331595
AB  - Fueled by rapid technological and methodological development, research in the area of genetic epidemiology has brought many successes as well as analytical challenges in identification of genetic risk factors for disease risk. Many have predicted that the detection of heritable disease susceptibility variants could eventually lead to stable models for prediction of disease risk. This dissertation is devoted to the statistical methodological consideration and development in genetic association studies, as well as the use of weighted genetic risk score in predictive modeling of disease risk.   We begin the work by reviewing a brief background into genetic association studies, predictive modeling and relevant analytic challenges. In Chapter 2, we discuss the theoretical relationship between classical multiple linear regression (MLR) and two-stage residual-outcome regression analysis (2SR) in terms of confounding adjustment. We demonstrate that the 2SR would introduce bias and loss of power in the presence of confounding, and thus remind researchers to be cautious in applying the 2SR in genetic association studies. In Chapter 3, we propose an adaptive permutation procedure in testing the significance of susceptibility genetic variants. Results show that the adaptive test is statistically valid as well as computationally feasible in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recommendations are made for the implementation of adaptive permutation in real studies. In Chapter 4, we develop an explained-variance based genetic risk score (GRS) for predictive modeling of disease risk. Extensive simulation studies suggest that this new weighted GRS is a robust risk score approach that consistently outperforms simple count and odds ratio based GRS approaches. In Chapter 5, we further explore the performance of GRS approaches in the presence of interactions, including statistical interaction, dependence and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results emphasize the advantage of weighted GRS even in more complicated settings, motivating its application in predictive modeling. This work concludes with several practical guidelines in genetic association studies and predictive modeling, and discussions of future perspectives.

T1  - Employing Online S-P Diagnostic Table for Qualitative Comments on Test Results
AN  - 1509087439; EJ1016233
AB  - The major concerns of adaptive testing studies have concentrated on effectiveness and efficiency of the system built for the research experiments. It has been criticised that such general information has fallen short of providing qualitative descriptions regarding learning performance. Takahiro Sato of Japan proposed an analytical diagram called Student-Problem Chart (S-P Chart) in the 1970. The S-P Chart is able to establish a learning diagnostic table which comments student learning performance in a verbal form. The advancement of computer technology has made the S-P analytical process more applicable for school teachers. This study examined how online comments provided by the S-P diagnostic table could affect the students' learning attitude. One hundred sixth grade students were selected to be the subjects of the study. An online embedded test was given to the subjects and an S-P diagnostic table was drawn by the computer to display instant comments on each student's learning performance. A Questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews were performed after the experiment. Results indicated that students liked the online qualitative comments. This is because students were able to instantly understand why they performed well/poor in the test, which is much beyond the numerical scores can explain. The results also showed that the online S-P diagnostic table made students more circumspect on answering the test questions in order to reduce careless mistakes. Students would also be more likely to review what they missed on the test. However, the S-P comment table seemed to have no effect on improving their learning performance. An online iterative drilling platform was consequently built to incorporate with the S-P diagnostic process to assist poorly performed students. It may effectively work with the S-P diagnostic process to provide constructive remediation for the students who exhibited a poor performance on the S-P chart.

T1  - A Mixture Rasch Model-Based Computerized Adaptive Test for Latent Class Identification
AN  - 1037907830; EJ974723
AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

T1  - Influence of Fear-Avoidance Beliefs on Functional Status Outcomes for People With Musculoskeletal Conditions of the Shoulder
AN  - 1038598234; 17085261
AB  - The influence of elevated fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of fearavoidance on recovery of functional status during rehabilitation for people with shoulder impairments. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted. Data were collected from 3,362 people with musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder receiving rehabilitation. At intake and discharge, upperextremity function was measured using the shoulder Computerized Adaptive Test. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale. Completion rate at discharge was 57% for function and 47% for pain intensity. A single-item screen was used to classify patients into groups with low versus elevated fear-avoidance beliefs at intake. A general linear model (GLM) was used to describe how change in function is affected by fear avoidance in 8 disease categories. This study also accounted for within-clinic correlation and controlled for other important predictors of functional change in functional status, including various demographic and healthrelated variables. The parameters of the GLM and their standard errors were estimated with the weighted generalized estimating equations method. Functional change was predicted by the interaction between fear and disease categories. On further examination of 8 disease categories using GLM adjusted for other confounders, improvement in function was greater for the low fear group than for the elevated fear group among people with muscle, tendon, and softtissue disorders ( delta =1.37, P <.01) and those with osteopathies, chondropathies, and acquired musculoskeletal deformities ( delta =5.52, P<.02). These differences were below the minimal detectable change. Information was not available on whether therapists used information on level of fear to implement treatment plans. The influence of fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status varies among specific shoulder impairments.

T1  - A computerized adaptive version of the SF-36 is feasible for clinic and Internet administration in adults with HIV
AN  - 1283739985; 201301875
AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N=100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N=101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A computerized adaptive version of the SF-36 is feasible for clinic and Internet administration in adults with HIV
AN  - 1023777666
AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N=100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N=101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A New Approach to the Measurement of Adaptive Behavior: Development of the PEDI-CAT for Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 1018479370; EJ964543
AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. (Contains 3 tables.)

T1  - An empirical examination of the impact of item parameters on IRT information functions in mixed format tests
AN  - 928069566
AB  - IRT, also referred as “modern test theory”, offers many advantages over CTT-based methods in test development. Specifically, an IRT information function has the capability to build a test that has the desired precision of measurement for any defined proficiency scale when a sufficient number of test items are available. This feature is extremely useful when the information is used for decision making, for instance, whether an examinee attain certain mastery level. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is one of the many examples using IRT information functions in test construction.    The purposes of this study were as follows: (1) to examine the consequences of improving the test quality through the addition of more discriminating items with different item formats; (2) to examine the effect of having a test where its difficulty does not align with the ability level of the intended population; (3) to investigate the change in decision consistency and decision accuracy; and (4) to understand changes in expected information when test quality is either improved or degraded, using both empirical and simulated data.   Main findings from the study were as follows: (1) increasing the discriminating power of any types of items generally increased the level of information; however, sometimes it could bring adverse effect to the extreme ends of the ability continuum; (2) it was important to have more items that were targeted at the population of interest, otherwise, no matter how good the quality of the items may be, they were of less value in test development when they were not targeted to the distribution of candidate ability or at the cutscores; (3) decision consistency (DC), Kappa statistic, and decision accuracy (DA) increased with better quality items; (4) DC and  Kappa were negatively affected when difficulty of the test did not match with the ability of the intended population; however, the effect was less severe if the test was easier than needed; (5) tests with more better quality items lowered false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rate at the cutscores; (6) when test difficulty did not match with the ability of the target examinees, in general, both FP and FN rates increased; (7) polytomous items tended to yield more information than dichotomously scored items, regardless of the discriminating parameter and difficulty of the item; and (8) the more score categories an item had, the more information it could provide.   Findings from this thesis should help testing agencies and practitioners to have better understanding of the item parameters on item and test information functions. This understanding is crucial for the improvement of the item bank quality and ultimately on how to build better tests that could provide more accurate proficiency classifications. However, at the same time, item writers should be conscientious about the fact that the item information function is merely a statistical tool for building a good test, other criteria should also be considered, for example, content balancing and content validity.

T1  - Feedback type as a moderator of the relationship between achievement goals and feedback reactions
AN  - 925739821; 201203528
AB  - The aim of the current study is to shed new light on the inconsistent relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining feedback type as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task? showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by feedback type. Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and feedback type also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used in a wide range of human resource and performance management instruments (e.g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/360 degree feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees' reactions and rate of performance improvement.

T1  - Feedback type as a moderator of the relationship between achievement goals and feedback reactions
AN  - 1010652368; 4290579
AB  - The aim of the current study is to shed new light on the inconsistent relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining feedback type as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task? showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by feedback type. Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and feedback type also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used in a wide range of human resource and performance management instruments (e.g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/360 degree feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees' reactions and rate of performance improvement.

T1  - Potential Impact of Context Effects on the Scoring and Equating of the Multistage GRE® Revised General Test. ETS GRE® Board Research Report. ETS GRE® GREB-08-01. ETS Research Report. RR-11-26
AN  - 1871579900; EJ1110374
AB  - Both theoretical and practical considerations have led the revision of the Graduate Record Examinations® (GRE®) revised General Test, here called the rGRE, to adopt a multistage adaptive design that will be continuously or nearly continuously administered and that can provide immediate score reporting. These circumstances sharply constrain the available options for equating or linking together the thousands of unique test forms that will need to be administered each year. The only practical method is to pre-equate each form through item response theory (IRT) methods. Unfortunately, doing so means that item position and context effects are both vitally important and potentially difficult to control. This study examines item position effects in a GRE context and attempts to assess the extent to which they may affect the rGRE. It was found that position effects are in fact present in GRE data and that they can be particularly troublesome under multistage testing. Pretest strategies are able to mitigate effects to some degree, but complete control will require careful attention be paid to the time limits and associated test configuration details in the design of the rGRE.

T1  - Controlling IC Quality through Diagnosis Based Adaptive Test
AN  - 897694545
AB  - The main purpose of manufacturing test has been and continues to be to separate good integrated circuits (ICs) from ones that do not meet the desired operational characteristics. An ideal testing procedure should pass all good chips and fail all those that do not deliver the required functionality. However, a defective chip may pass all the tests, which leads to reduction in product quality. Product quality is commonly measured using defect level, which is the ratio of defective chips in all the chips that pass all tests. Defect level is typically expressed in units of defective parts per million shipped (DPPM). A variety of test sets derived using different test metrics are usually applied to ensure an acceptable quality level. However, various experiments involving actual ICs have shown that a significant portion of the test patterns applied do not contribute to the improvement in product quality, which indicates the possibility of significantly reducing the cost of test without affecting product quality, or alternatively improving product quality without incurring additional test cost.    In this dissertation, a diagnosis-assisted adaptive test (DAT) method for improving test quality is described, developed, and validated. DAT uses diagnosis to capture the failure characteristics on a per-design basis and improves test quality by changing the test set to match the current failure characteristics. DAT uses (i) a multiple defect diagnosis method, referred to as MD2X, which is flexible in handling various defect behaviors, and (ii) a failing behavior identification (FBI) method that captures defect behavior by identifying signal lines related to defect activation.    MD2X is evaluated using logic simulation experiments. Results from over 5,700 simulated and 131 failing ICs show that MD 2X can effectively diagnose circuits that are affected by a large (>20) or small number of defects of various types. Specifically, when diagnosing circuits with more than 20 defects, MD2X identifies 74% of them. For circuits affected by two defects, the number changes to 87%. This level of diagnosis accuracy for ICs of this type exceeds all claims currently found in the literature.    The efficacy of FBI is validated using circuit- and logic-level simulation experiments. The results show that FBI achieves an average accuracy of 94% in identifying signal lines that are relevant to defect activation, a 28% improvement over prior art.    DAT is validated using circuit-level simulation experiments and experiments involving real IC fail data. Circuit-level simulation involving various types of defects shows that defect level can be reduced by 30% using DAT. In addition, a new cost-efficient framework for evaluating test quality using tester data from failing ICs, which we call FETQ, has also been developed. FETQ is used to evaluate the quality of tests based on DAT. Among the test sets of the same size, the test set generated using DAT detects the most failing chips, and it uniquely fails one defective chip that is not detected by any of the test sets that are generated based on stuck-at, bridge, and input-pattern fault models. The test quality of DAT test sets is also compared with the original one used in production. The result shows that DAT test sets detect more failing chips with the same number of test patterns, or alternatively, the same number of failing chips could be detected using significantly fewer tests.

T1  - Adaptive Architectures for Robust and Efficient Computing
AN  - 896357604
AB  - Semiconductor technology scaling has long been a source of dramatic gains in our computing capabilities. However, as we test the physical limits of silicon feature size, serious reliability and computational efficiency challenges confront us. The supply voltage levels have practically stagnated, resulting in increasing power densities and operating temperatures. Given that most semiconductor wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Further, the rise in power density is also limiting the number of resources that can be kept active on chip simultaneously, motivating the need for energy-efficient computing.    In this landscape of technological challenges, incremental architectural improvements to existing designs are likely insufficient, motivating a need to rethink the architectural fabric from the ground up. Towards this end, this thesis presents adaptive architecture and compiler solutions that can effectively tackle reliability, performance and energy-efficiency demands expected in future microprocessors.    For the reliability challenge, we present StageNet, a highly reconfigurable multicore architecture that is designed as a network of pipeline stages, rather than isolated cores. The interconnection flexibility in StageNet allows it to adaptively route around defective pieces of a processor, and deliver graceful performance degradation in the face of failures. We further complement the fault isolation ability of StageNet with an adaptive testing framework that significantly reduces the overhead of in-field fault detection.    As a second contribution, we build upon the interconnection flexibility of StageNet to develop a unified performance-reliability solution. This subsequent design, named CoreGenesis, relies on a set of microarchitectural innovations and compiler hints to merge processor cores for a higher single-thread performance. This enables customization of processing ability (narrow or wide-issue pipelines) to the dynamic workload requirements.    In the final work of this thesis, we investigate the sources of computational inefficiency in general purpose processors, and propose a configurable compute engine, named BERET, for substantial energy savings. The insight here is to cut down on the redundant instruction fetch, decode and register file access energy by optimizing the execution of recurring instruction sequences.

T1  - Development of the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument: A Sequential Exploratory Mixed Methods Design
AN  - 1123912459
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that commonly manifests in the feet as pain, swelling and deformity. These symptoms often have extensive and severe mutlidimensional consequences for people's lives and can be evaluated using a class of subjective outcome measures known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs have been advocated by the Darzi report and are central to reforms in the NHS.Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a new and novel PROM, the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument (SAFE), using a clinimetric approach and featuring an adequately pre-tested nomothetic (fixed scale) and idiographic (patient-specific scale) assessment strategy. A mixed methods approach was employed to develop the SAFE, with the formulation and implementation of a four phase sequential exploratory fully mixed methods design (SEMMD) that featured equal priority between the qualitative and quantitative components.The four phase SEMMD enabled the strategic and effective combination of methods to produce a PROM that is firmly rooted in the views and experiences of people with feet affected by RA. The nomothetic scale of the SAFE has evidence for face, content and convergent validity (Spearman-Rank co-efficients: 0.62 - 0.80) and excellent one week test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.86 - 1.00 ). The idiographic scale has evidence for face and content validity.The SAFE is a tool for both clinical practice and clinical research. In order to realise the full potential of the SAFE, further research will be undertaken to refine, develop the PROM and integrate it into clinical practice. Initially, it will be necessary to demonstrate additional measurement properties for the nomothetic scale, including clinical interpretability and responsiveness and also necessary to demonstrate quantitative measurement properties for the idiographic scale. Long term, the SAFE will be redeveloped using item response theory and implemented as a computerised adaptive test.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing, Anxiety Levels, and Gender Differences
AN  - 757171388; EJ896744
AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

T1  - A Computerized Adaptive Test for Patients With Shoulder Impairments Produced Responsive Measures of Function
AN  - 860387520; 14539822
AB  - Background Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. Design This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Methods Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. Results On average, patients took about 1.5 minutes (SD <2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal clinically important improvement. Limitations Because this study was a secondary analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future studies would benefit from more complete data. Conclusions The results indicate the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

T1  - Measuring Social Well-Being in People with Chronic Illness
AN  - 754037890; 201052290
AB  - Although social well-being (SWB) is recognized as an integral component of health, it is rarely included in health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments. Two SWB dimensions were identified by literature review: social support (SWB-SS) and social function (SWB-SF). As part of a larger project to develop item response theory-derived item banks and computerized adaptive testing, we developed and tested items for the SWB banks. Item ratings of three large (n>600) datasets were conducted by 15 reviewers. Rasch measurement analyses were conducted to initially define item hierarchies. Out of 83 total items, 8 were removed due to model misfit and 8 were removed because of overlapping item content. We then wrote 11 new SWB-SS and 16 new SWB-SF items to fill content gaps, and edited items to improve comprehension and consistency. A total of 94 items (65 SWB-SS, 29 SWB-SF) was administered by computer to 202 cancer patients. Confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch analyses, and evaluations of construct validity were performed. Patients commented favorably on the content of the items and expressed appreciation for attention to this aspect of their HRQL. Using current psychometric standards for unidimensionality, reliability, and content and construct validity, we derived six preliminary item banks for social support (instrumental support, informational support, positive and negative emotional support, positive and negative social companionship) and two for social function (limitations and satisfaction). The empirical construct hierarchy was consistent with clinical observations; e.g., hobbies and leisure activities tended to reflect more limitations, while meeting the needs of family and friends tended to reflect fewer limitations. Optimal care for patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses includes obtaining a complete picture of patients' physical and psychosocial health status. SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment can affect quality of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment. Adapted from the source document.

SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment can affect quality of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An application of computerised adaptive testing for measuring health status in patients with knee osteoarthritis
AN  - 853208757; 201106032
AB  - Purpose. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for measuring health status in knee osteoarthritis. Method. Three hundred and fifty-one patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) answered 118 questions from a range of widely used questionnaires. Three dimensions relevant to knee OA were identified by expert opinion as 'pain, mental and emotional status'; 'self-care and household activities' and 'mobility and social activities'. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the relationship between the items and their dimensions. After CFA, these dimensions were subjected to Rasch analysis to calibrate the items onto an interval scale. A CAT was developed for each dimension, and the results checked against simulated applications from 10,000 simulees. Results. After CFA and Rasch analysis, 14, 22 and 23 items remained in the first, second and third dimensions, respectively. Items were mostly free of differential item functioning for age, gender and duration of disease. Reliability exceeded 0.87 for each dimension. The health status levels generated using item banks and those obtained from the simulated CAT application were highly correlated (i.e. >0.91 for each dimension). On average, 8, 10 and 10 items were used to estimate the health status levels using the CAT for the first, second and third dimensions respectively. Conclusions. Using a combination approach of CFA and Rasch analysis, this study has shown that it is possible to calibrate items onto a single metric in a way that can be used to provide the basis of a CAT application.

T1  - Comparison of Different Equating Methods and An Application to Link Testlet-Based Tests
AN  - 822411041
AB  - Test equating allows direct comparison of test scores from alternative forms measuring the same construct by employing equating procedures to put the test scores on the same metric. Three equating procedures are commonly used in the literature including the concurrent calibration method, the linking separate calibration methods (e.g. the moment methods and the characteristic curve methods), and FPC (Fixed Parameter Calibration) method. The first two types of methods for traditional IRT model have been well developed. FPC is being emphasized recently because of its utility for constructing item bank and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). However, there are few studies that examine the equating accuracy of the FPC method compared to that of the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method.    The equating methods for the traditional IRT model are not appropriate for linking testlet-based tests because the local independence assumption of IRT model cannot be held for this type of tests. Some measurement models, such as testlet response model, bi-factor model, and Rasch testlet model, were advanced to calibrate the models for the testlet-based tests. Few equating methods, however, that take into consideration the additional local dependence among the examinees' responses to items within testlets have been developed for linking testelet-based tests.    To address the need to better understand the FPC method and to develop new equating methods for linking testlet-based tests, the studies were to compare the effectiveness of the three types of equating methods under different linking situations and to develop equating methods for linking testlet-based tests. Besides the equating methods concerned, other factors, including sample size, ability distribution, and characteristics of common items and testlets that might affect equating results were also considered. Three simulation studies were carried out to accomplish the research purposes.    The first study compared the equating accuracies of the FPC, the linking separate calibration, and the concurrent calibration method based on the IRT model to equate item parameters under different conditions. The results indicated that the FPC method using BILOG-MG performed as well as the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method for linking the equivalent groups. However, the FPC method produced larger equating errors than the other two methods did when the ability distributions of the base and target groups were substantially nonequivalent. Differences in difficulties between the common items set and the total test did not substantially affect the equating results with the three methods, with other conditions being held equal. As expected, both small sample size and less number of common items led to slight greater equating errors.    The second study developed an item characteristic curve method and a testlet characteristic curve method for the testlet response model to transform the scale of item parameters. It then compared the effectiveness of the characteristic curve methods and the concurrent calibration methods under different conditions in linking item parameters from alternate test forms which were composed of dichotomously scored testlet-based items. The newly developed item characteristic curve method and the testlet characteristic curve method were shown to perform similarly as or even better than the Stocking-Lord test characteristic curve method and the concurrent calibration method did. Ignoring the local dependence in model calibration substantially increased equating errors. And larger testlet variances for the common testlets led to greater equating errors.    The last study used the concurrent calibration method under the multidimensional Rasch testlet model to link the testlet-based tests in which the testlets were composed of dichotomous, polytomous, and mixed-format items. The results demonstrated that the concurrent calibration method under the Rasch testlet model worked well in recovering the underlying item parameters. Again, equating errors were substantially increased if the local dependences were ignored in model calibration. And smaller testlet variances for the common testlets led to more accurate equating results.    The results of the studies contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of the different equating methods, particularly those for linking testlet-based tests. They also help clarify influences of the other factors, such as characteristics of the examinees, features of the common items and common testlets on equating results. Testing practitioners and researchers may draw useful recommendations from the findings about equating method selection. Nevertheless, generalizations of the findings from the simulated studies to practical testing programs should be cautious.

T1  - Un algorithme d’échantillonnage permettant d’améliorer la performance prédictive d’un modèle bayésien dans le cadre d’applications de tests adaptatifs
AN  - 750964376
AB  - Bayesian graphical models are commonly used to build student models from data. A number of standard algorithms are available to train Bayesian models from student skills assessment data. These models can assess student knowledge and skills from a few observations. They are useful for Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), for example, where the test items can be administered in order to maximize the information they will provide. In practice, such data often contain missing values and, under some circumstances, missing values far outnumber observed values. However, when collecting data from test results, one can often choose which values will be present or missing by a consequent test design. We study how to optimize the choice of test items for collecting the data that will be used for training a Bayesian CAT model, such as to maximize the predictive performance of the model. We explore the use of a simple heuristic for test item choice based on the level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of an item is derived from its initial probability of success and, thus, from its difficulty.    The results show that this choice does affect model performance and that the heuristic can lead to better performance. Although the study’s results are more exploratory than conclusive, they suggest interesting research avenues.

T1  - Impact of item parameter drift on examinee ability measures in a computer adaptive environment
AN  - 750171758
AB  - This dissertation investigated the impact of item parameter drift (IPD) on examinee ability measures, in the analysis of data generated from a computerized adaptive test (CAT) collected in year 2003 by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in a Medical Technologist (MT) examination. For the 2003 ASCP MT exam, the item bank included 1,270 items. Items were selected from seven subscales: (a) blood banking, (b) chemistry, (c) hematology, (d) immunology, (e) laboratory operations, (f) microbiology, and (g) urinalysis. ASCP administered this CAT to 2,555 examinees.    The data were analyzed using a new hierarchical linear model (HLM), called the Rasch longitudinal model (RLM), which models interaction between the item and time, in addition to parameters of examinee ability and item difficulty (easiness). The analysis demonstrated how IPD within the item bank for the ASCP MT exam affected examinee ability measures, and the extent to which IPD altered certification or pass-fail decisions.    The RLM identified items that exhibited significant IPD for each subscale and provided the magnitude (and direction) of IPD within the 2003 ASCP MT exam data. No one subscale was more sensitive to IPD than any other. Further, by including significant time effects (IPD), the RLM provided a better fit to the data than the Rasch model as an HLM. The RLM not only determined items exhibiting IPD but also compensated for the existence of IPD within the calculation of examinee abilities by using the drifted item difficulty value versus the anchored one. Consequently, the RLM provided more accurate measures of examinee ability and item difficulty than the Rasch model as analyzed using the WINSTEPS program As a result, using the RLM yielded a more efficient IPD detection method, one that identified items with IPD but also corrected the estimation of examinee abilities for the existence of IPD.

T1  - Bilingual health literacy assessment using the Talking Touchscreen/la Pantalla Parlanchina: Development and pilot testing
AN  - 57305435; 200917595
AB  - Objective -- Current health literacy measures are too long, imprecise, or have questionable equivalence of English and Spanish versions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and pilot testing of a new bilingual computer-based health literacy assessment tool. Methods -- We analyzed literacy data from three large studies. Using a working definition of health literacy, we developed new prose, document and quantitative items in English and Spanish. Items were pilot tested on 97 English- and 134 Spanish-speaking participants to assess item difficulty. Results -- Items covered topics relevant to primary care patients and providers. English- and Spanish-speaking participants understood the tasks involved in answering each type of question. The English Talking Touchscreen was easy to use and the English and Spanish items provided good coverage of the difficulty continuum. Conclusion -- Qualitative and quantitative results provided useful information on computer acceptability and initial item difficulty. After the items have been administered on the Talking Touchscreen (la Pantalla Parlanchina) to 600 English-speaking (and 600 Spanish-speaking) primary care patients, we will develop a computer adaptive test. Practice implications -- This health literacy tool will enable clinicians and researchers to more precisely determine the level at which low health literacy adversely affects health and healthcare utilization.

T1  - Using real-data simulations to compare computer adaptive testing and static short-form administrations of an upper extremity item bank
AN  - 304874079
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which administers only items relevant to respondents’ ability, has the advantage of measuring persons’ ability precisely with considerably fewer items than traditional tests. CAT has been proposed for use in healthcare to reduce the respondents’, administrators’ or researchers’ burden in clinics/clinical trials. However, there have been few studies in healthcare that have investigated the optimal characteristics of a CAT. The objective of my study was to investigate: (1) the psychometrics of an item bank measuring upper extremity (UE) disorders for CAT use, (2) how different testing procedures affect the ability estimates from CAT, and (3) whether CAT produce better ability estimates than a traditional static short assessment. The psychometrics of the item bank developed by combining items from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Upper Extremity Functional Index were examined by confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis across body part impairments (neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand). Repeated-measures MANOVA was used to investigate the standard error (SE) and bias of ability estimates from CAT with different testing procedures. Structural equation modeling was implemented to examine the correlations between ability estimates from the full test and different CAT structures and the full test with a short form. Further, paired-sample t test was performed to investigate the SE and bias of ability estimates from CAT and a static short form. In general, the item bank was found essentially unidimensional, the generalized partial credit model fit to the data better than partial credit model and there was no significant DIF. The ability estimates from CAT with expected a posteriori ability estimation method was found to be more precise and more comparable to those from full test than ability estimates derived from the maximum likelihood estimation. Further, CAT had better precision, comparability to full test and sensitivity to detect change than a static short form. The findings from this study suggest that UE CAT differ across estimations methods and are significantly better than a short form version.

T1  - Using computerized adaptive testing to reduce the burden of mental health assessment
AN  - 42437618; 30738
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the combination of item response theory and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for psychiatric measurement as a means of reducing the burden of research and clinical assessments. METHODS: Data were from 800 participants in outpatient treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder; they completed 616 items of the 626-item Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Scales (MASS) at 2 times. The first administration was used to design and evaluate a CAT version of the MASS by using post hoc simulation. The second confirmed the functioning of CAT in live testing. RESULTS: Tests of competing models based on item response theory supported the scale's bifactor structure, consisting of a primary dimension and 4 group factors (mood, panic-agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, and social phobia). Both simulated and live CAT showed a 95% average reduction (585 items) in items administered (24 and 30 items, respectively) compared with administration of the full MASS. The correlation between scores on the full MASS and the CAT version was .93. For the mood disorder subscale, differences in scores between two groups of depressed patients -- one with bipolar disorder and one without -- on the full scale and on the CAT showed effect sizes of .63 (p < .003) and 1.19 (p < .001) standard deviation units, respectively, indicating better discriminant validity for CAT. CONCLUSIONS: Instead of using small fixed-length tests, clinicians can create item banks with a large item pool, and a small set of the items most relevant for a given individual can be administered with no loss of information, yielding a dramatic reduction in administration time and patient and clinician burden.

T1  - Till We Meet Again
AN  - 223121969
AB  - In a series of articles in this issue, Allen proposes and tests a model of movement1; reports the validity and reliability of a self-report instrument, the Movement Ability Measure (MAM)2; and tests the responsiveness to change of the MAM on a small sample of patients.3 The multidimensional model of movement-which includes flexibility, strength, accuracy, speed, adaptability, and endurance-specifies the term "movement" at the human, not cellular or molecular, level for the Movement Continuum Theory.4 As noted in Allen's discussion and in the invited commentaries by Cott and Finch, Martin, and Sullivan, the proposed model of movement has limitations, and the assessment tool has not been tested sufficiently to indicate that it is superior to other instruments such as the Outpatient Physical Therapy Improvement in Movement Assessment Log (OPTIMAL)5 or the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) "item bank" and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) assessment platform (AMPAC-CAT).6 It is clear that we are in the initial rather than final stages of consensus about an instrument that measures outcomes affected by physical therapy intervention and that crosses medical diagnoses, systems, practice settings, acuity, and other variables.

T1  - Relationships between NWEA -MAP score information and teachers' efficacy beliefs for student performance on the North Dakota State Assessment
AN  - 304845516
AB  - In the current environment of federally mandated high-stakes testing, teachers and schools are under great pressure to ensure that students demonstrate proficiency on state assessments. Without formative feedback that connects what a teacher did in the classroom with positive outcomes on the state assessment, a teacher may not feel that he or she can make a difference in how students fare on the state assessment. Teachers who experience low self-efficacy use less effective teaching techniques, and this affects student learning.    Many schools are now using computer adaptive testing, such as the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA-MAP), to provide teachers with formative information to use for instructional improvement. When adjustments to instruction result in higher student achievement, it can provide the teacher with mastery experiences that increase the teacher's efficacy perceptions.    The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teachers' efficacy beliefs for making a difference in their students' performances on the state assessment and teachers' uses of NWEA-MAP test results. Teachers were surveyed using four measures of teacher efficacy and collective teacher efficacy. Two measures that were created for this study demonstrated high reliability with the study sample and correlated well with the two existing scales. Data were also collected on the ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information and the number of different ways they used score information.    The results indicated that the number of ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information made a significant difference in teachers' scores on the efficacy measures: Using score information in three or four different ways was associated with the highest scores on the efficacy scales. Also, using test score information to set goals with students and to individualize instruction predicted teachers' efficacy scores to a greater degree than did using scores to adjust curriculum and instruction.    The current study, with its two new measures and its suggestions of relationships between variables, provides a starting point for new lines of research in sources of teacher efficacy beliefs.

T1  - Computerized adaptive test item response times for correct and incorrect pretest and operational items: Testing fairness and test -taking strategies
AN  - 304842739
AB  - This study examined the amount of time spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items.    Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels.    A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners’ manual.

T1  - Measurement of Korean EFL college students' foreign language classroom speaking anxiety: Evidence of psychometric properties and accuracy of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) with dichotomously scored items using a CAT simulation
AN  - 85626294; 200614254
AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

T1  - Advanced L2 Learners and Reading Placement: Self-Assessment, CBT, and Subsequent Performance
AN  - 85642362; 200609873
AB  - There is a dearth of research involving advanced second language (L2) learners in the USA [Brantmeier, C., 2001. Second language reading research on passage content & gender: challenges for the intermediate level curriculum, Foreign Language Annals 34, 325-333; Young, D.J., 2003. Workshop on overcoming anxiety in the foreign language classroom. Language Learning Series, Washington University in St. Louis]. At some universities in the USA many freshmen test directly into the advanced levels of Spanish language instruction where the goal is to prepare students for the reading of lengthy, authentic texts. With 71 advanced L2 learners of Spanish, the current research project attempts to determine the reliability of self-assessment, as determined by a questionnaire previously utilized for placement [Birckbichler, D., Corl, K., Deville, C., 1993. The dynamics of language program testing: implications for articulation & program revision. The Dynamics of Language Program Direction. Heinle & Heinle, Boston, MA; Deville, M., Deville, C., 1999. Computer-adaptive testing in second language contexts. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 19, 273-299], to predict reading performance via computer-based testing (CBT) & subsequent reading achievement. All incoming freshmen completed self-assessment questions about L2 reading abilities before completing an online placement exam (OPLE). In order to assess subsequent reading performance, all students who tested into Advanced Spanish Grammar & Composition participated in an investigation during regular class time during the 3rd week of class. Participants read a short story, completed three different comprehension assessment tasks & additional self-assessment items. Overall, results of the present study suggest that self-assessment of L2 reading ability, as measured before & after reading via a 5-point scale, is not an accurate predictor variable for placement or subsequent performance. Advanced learners did not accurately estimate their L2 reading abilities as measured via CBT & in-class performance. Findings do not offer conclusive evidence about the value of self-assessment as a predictor of performance on CBT or as an indicator of subsequent classroom performance, but the current investigation provides indications as to the direction in which research on self-assessment of L2 reading needs to move. A more contextualized, criterion-referenced self-assessment instrument may be more beneficial for the placement of advanced readers in the USA. These results both echo & contradict prior research, which calls attention to the need for more investigations concerning instrumentation of self-assessment as a factor to be used in placement decisions for advanced learners. 2 Tables, 5 Figures, 1 Appendix, 58 References.

T1  - Advanced L2 Learners and Reading Placement: Self-Assessment, CBT, and Subsequent Performance
AN  - 61919806; EJ803898
AB  - There is a dearth of research involving advanced second language (L2) learners in the USA [Brantmeier, C., 2001. Second language reading research on passage content and gender: challenges for the intermediate level curriculum, Foreign Language Annals 34, 325-333; Young, D.J., 2003. Workshop on overcoming anxiety in the foreign language classroom. Language Learning Series, Washington University in St. Louis]. At some universities in the USA many freshmen test directly into the advanced levels of Spanish language instruction where the goal is to prepare students for the reading of lengthy, authentic texts. With 71 advanced L2 learners of Spanish, the current research project attempts to determine the reliability of self-assessment, as determined by a questionnaire previously utilized for placement [Birckbichler, D., Corl, K., Deville, C., 1993. The dynamics of language program testing: implications for articulation and program revision. The Dynamics of Language Program Direction. Heinle and Heinle, Boston, MA; Deville, M., Deville, C., 1999. Computer-adaptive testing in second language contexts. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 19, 273-299], to predict reading performance via computer-based testing (CBT) and subsequent reading achievement. All incoming freshmen completed self-assessment questions about L2 reading abilities before completing an online placement exam (OPLE). In order to assess subsequent reading performance, all students who tested into Advanced Spanish Grammar and Composition participated in an investigation during regular class time during the 3rd week of class. Participants read a short story, completed three different comprehension assessment tasks and additional self-assessment items. Overall, results of the present study suggest that self-assessment of L2 reading ability, as measured before and after reading via a 5-point scale, is not an accurate predictor variable for placement or subsequent performance. Advanced learners did not accurately estimate their L2 reading abilities as measured via CBT and in-class performance. Findings do not offer conclusive evidence about the value of self-assessment as a predictor of performance on CBT or as an indicator of subsequent classroom performance, but the current investigation provides indications as to the direction in which research on self-assessment of L2 reading needs to move. A more contextualized, criterion-referenced self-assessment instrument may be more beneficial for the placement of advanced readers in the USA. These results both echo and contradict prior research, which calls attention to the need for more investigations concerning instrumentation of self-assessment as a factor to be used in placement decisions for advanced learners.

T1  - Impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification on ability estimation in computerized adaptive sequential testing (CAST)
AN  - 305322722
AB  - Computer Adaptive Sequential Testing (CAST) is a test delivery model that combines features of the traditional conventional paper-and-pencil testing and item-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The basic structure of CAST is a panel composed of multiple testlets adaptively administered to examinees at different stages. Current applications of CAST reply on the item response theory (IRT) and assume a unidimensional IRT model for scoring.    This study evaluated the robustness of CAST when tests were constructed, administered, and scored by a unidimensional IRT model but item responses were multidimensional. Various conditions of multidimensionality were simulated in item pools, as well as different levels of content misclassification through manipulation of the correspondence between content area and dimension of items. An automated test assembly (ATA) process constructed CAST panels from the item pools, each representing a unique combination of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Administration of the panels was simulated and multidimensional response data were scored by the unidimensional IRT model. The ability scores, routing decisions, and pass-fail decisions were evaluated against "true" ability scores and decisions to assess the impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification.    Results showed that, when multidimensionality was mild as measured by the angle distance between item clusters, unidimensional ability estimates and routing decisions were not sensitive to the level of content misclassification in item pools. Only when multidimensionality was severe, panels without content misclassification yielded more accurate ability estimates and routing decisions. However, type I errors of pass-fail decisions (defined as passing unqualified examinees) were the smallest for panels without content misclassification, regardless of the severity of multidimensionality. The conclusion was that, although content classification, affecting dimensional structure during test assembly, might not be a serious concern for unidimensional ability estimation and routing decisions for CAST with multidimensional data, it played a significant role in the accuracy of pass-fail decisions.

T1  - Computerized adaptive testing and the experience of flow in examinees
AN  - 305308795
AB  - In recent years, comparisons between computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and paper-and-pencil tests (P&Ps) have focused less on equivalency and more on the construct validity of shifting between the modalities. Examinee motivation is one area of concern, including test and computer anxiety. One type of motivation, flow, has a characteristic pattern of development similar to the pattern of item selection in CAT. Flow theory posits that positive reinforcement is gained through the sensation of achieving optimal performance. This study attempts to determine whether CAT facilitates flow in examinees, enabling them to perform better than on P&Ps. Covariates like test and computer anxiety, academic achievement, and certain personality traits are taken into account. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 94 middle-school CAT examinees to 65 middle-school P&P examinees on their responses to the Flow State Scale 2 (FSS-2), and regression modeling revealed a significant interaction between test modality and test anxiety on state flow, and significant effects for trait flow, typical study time, gender, and ethnicity when controlling for other covariates. Significant effects on specific flow dimensions were also found. The effect of flow on test performance was examined, but may have been limited by sample size. Reliability and dimensionality was confirmed for several instruments, some for the first time with an adolescent population: FSS-2, the Dispositional Flow Scale 2, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Test Anxiety Inventory-Short Form, and the Computer Attitude Scale. Interviews with students were also conducted to confirm the validity of measuring flow in testing situations. Implications of the results are discussed.

T1  - TRENDS IN COMPUTER-BASED SECOND LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT
AN  - 197984864
AB  - In the last 20 years, several authors have described the possible changes that computers may effect in language testing. Since ARAL's last review of general language testing trends (Clapham, 2000), authors in the Cambridge Language Assessment Series have offered various visions of how computer technology could alter the testing of second language skills. This chapter reflects these perspectives as it charts the paths recently taken in the field. Initial steps were made in the conversion of existing item types and constructs already known from paper-and- pencil testing into formats suitable for computer delivery. This conversion was closely followed by the introduction of computer-adaptive tests, which aim to make more, and perhaps, better, use of computer capabilities to tailor tests more closely to individual abilities and interests. Movement toward greater use of computers in assessment has been coupled with an assumption that computer-based tests should be better than their traditional predecessors, and some related steps have been taken. Corpus linguistics has provided tools to create more authentic assessments; the quest for authenticity has also motivated inclusion of more complex tasks and constructs. Both these innovations have begun to be incorporated into computer-based language tests. Natural language processing has also provided some tools for computerized scoring of essays, particularly relevant in large-scale language testing programs. Although computer use has not revolutionized all aspects of language testing, recent efforts have produced some of the research, technological advances, and improved pedagogical understanding needed to support progress.

T1  - On the beat: Human movement and timing in the production and perception of music
AN  - 305378616
AB  - This thesis addresses three aspects of movement, performance and perception in music performance. First, the playing of an accent, a simple but much used and practiced element in drumming is studied, second, the perception of gradually changing tempo, and third, the perception and communication of specific emotional intentions through movements during music performance.    Papers I and II investigated the execution and interpretation of an accent in drumming, performed under different playing conditions. Players' movements, striking velocities and timing patterns were studied for different tempi, dynamic levels and striking surfaces. It was found that the players used differing movement strategies and that interpreted the accent differently, reflected in their movement trajectories. Strokes at higher dynamic levels were played from a greater average height and with higher striking velocities. All players initiated the accented strokes from a greater height, and delivered the accent with increased striking velocity compared to the unaccented strokes. The interval beginning with the accented stroke was also prolonged, generally by delaying the following stroke. Recurrent cyclic patterns were found in the players' timing performances. In a listening test, listeners perceived grouping of the strokes according to the cyclic patterns.    Paper III concerned the perception of gradual tempo changes in auditory sequences. Using an adaptive test procedure subjects judged stimuli consisting of click sequences with either increasing or decreasing tempo, respectively. Each experiment included three test sessions at different nominal tempi (80, 120, and 180 beats per minute). The results showed that ten of the eleven subjects showed an inherent bias in their perception of tempo drift. The direction and magnitude of the bias was consistent between test sessions but varied between individuals. The just noticeable differences for tempo drift agreed well with the estimated tempo drifts in production data, but were much smaller than earlier reported thresholds for tempo drift.    Paper IV studied how emotional intent in music performances is conveyed to observers through the movements of the musicians. Three players of marimba, bassoon, and saxophone respectively, were filmed when playing with the expressive intentions Happiness, Sadness, Anger and Fear. Observers rated the emotional content and movement cues in the videos clips shown without sound. The results showed that the observers were able to identify the intentions Sadness, Anger, and Happiness, but not Fear. The rated movement cues showed that an Angry performance was characterized by jerky movements, Happy performances by large, and somewhat fast and jerky movements, and Sad performances by slow, and smooth movements.

T1  - Constructing Rotating Item Pools for Constrained Adaptive Testing
AN  - 57303096; 200917761
AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

T1  - Constructing Rotating Item Pools for Constrained Adaptive Testing: Journal of Educational Measurement
AN  - 197414203
AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

T1  - A calibration of the McGill Pain Questionnaire -Short Form: Using item response theory
AN  - 305195281
AB  - The McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ - SF) is a measure of pain published in 1987. This dissertation conducts a confirmatory factor analysis of the measure's structure, as well as a calibration of the items on the measure, using Item Response Theory. A total of 1185 patients reporting to two chronic pain care treatment centers completed the MPQ - SF in the course of their admission to treatment. Factor analyses of their data suggests a three-factor solution of “acute,” “emotional,” and “soreness” factors led to a higher order factor of “pain.” This solution provides an adequate fit for the data. Previously published one and two factor structures did not demonstrate adequate fit in this data set. Unidimensionality in this sample was supported by the presence of a higher order factor of “Pain.” Items on the measure are calibrated using the two-parameter logistic model. Specifically, item slope and location parameters are calculated for each of the items, and differential item functioning is investigated between four subgroups of data. Performance on the items was contrasted between subgroups differing on gender, pain diagnosis, workers' compensation status and pain coping status using Raju's DFIT methodology. No differential test functioning was found; however, some individual items did display differential item functioning by subgroup. Sample characteristics that contribute to differential item functioning are examined further. Additionally, implications for diagnostic considerations and computer adaptive testing are discussed.

T1  - Evaluating the effects of several multi -stage testing design variables on selected psychometric outcomes for certification and licensure assessment
AN  - 305176302
AB  - Computer-based testing is becoming popular with credentialing agencies because new test designs are possible and the evidence is clear that these new designs can increase the reliability and validity of candidate scores and pass/fail decisions. Research on MST to date suggests that the measurement quality of MST results is comparable to full-fledged computer-adaptive tests and improved over computerized fixed-form tests. MST's promise dwells in this potential for improved measurement with greater control than other adaptive approaches for constructing test forms.    Recommending use of the MST design and advising how best to set up the design, however, are two different things. The purpose of the current simulation study was to advance an established line of research on MST methodology by enhancing understanding of how several important design variables affect outcomes for high-stakes credentialing.   Modeling of the item bank, the candidate population, and the statistical characteristics of test items reflect an operational credentialing exam's conditions. Studied variables were module arrangement (4 designs), amount of overall test information (4 levels), distribution of information over stages (2 variations), strategies for between-stage routing (4 levels), and pass rates (3 levels), for 384 conditions total.   Results showed that high levels of decision accuracy (DA) and decision consistency (DC) were consistently observed, even when test information was reduced by as much as 25%. No differences due to the choice of module arrangement were found. With high overall test information, results were optimal when test information was divided equally among stages; with reduced test information gathering more test information at Stage 1 provided the best results.    Generalizing simulation study findings is always problematic. In practice, psychometric models never completely explain candidate performance, and with MST, there is always the potential psychological impact on candidates if test difficulty shifts are noticed. At the same time, two findings seem to stand out in this research: (1) with limited amounts of overall test information, it may be best to capitalize on available information with accurate branching decisions early, and (2) there may be little statistical advantage in exceeding test information much above 10 as gains in reliability and validity appear minimal.

T1  - Influence of Voice Similarity on Talker Discrimination in Normal-Hearing Children and Hearing-Impaired Children with Cochlear Implants
AN  - 85574885; 200310417
AB  - In this study, we investigated how manipulations of voice similarity affect talker discrimination judgments in children. More specifically, we addressed the question of how different must two sentences be in terms of their average fundamental & formant frequencies for children to categorize these utterances as spoken by different talkers? Same-different judgments were obtained using an adaptive testing procedure in which the similarity of voice pairs was systematically varied. Participants included 5-year-old normal-hearing children & cochlear implant (CI) users ages 5-12 years, implanted at or before age 6 years with 2+ years of implant experience. Stimuli consisted of natural sentence-length utterances resynthesized to form a stimulus continuum of similar-sounding voices. The probability of "different talker" judgments was examined for each listener group as a function of pitch difference size. We compared this measure of "acceptable within-talker variability" under two different presentation conditions, one in which the linguistic content of the sentence was held constant & one in which the linguistic content was varied. We found that the spectral envelopes of two utterances, together with their average fundamental frequencies, needed to differ by at least 11-16% for normal-hearing children to perceive the voices as belonging to different talkers. Normal-hearing children maintained the perception of voice individuality over a larger frequency shift than previously studied normal-hearing adults. Although several individual children with implants exhibited response patterns that resembled those of normal-hearing children, most of the hearing-impaired children experienced difficulty perceiving even large differences between talkers. Both groups of children displayed essentially the same pattern of responses in both the "fixed sentence" & "varied sentence" conditions, indicating no effect of linguistic variability on the children's criteria for identifying two talkers as the same or different. Greater variability in performance was observed, however, in the varied sentence condition for both listener groups. Finally, within the CI group, higher spoken word recognition scores were found to be associated with better talker discrimination performance. Our results suggest that poor discrimination of pitch & timbre-based differences is a factor contributing to implanted children's difficulty with talker discrimination tasks; implications of this finding are discussed in detail. 4 Tables, 12 Figures, 4 Appendixes, 110 References.

T1  - Statistical detection and estimation of differential item functioning in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 305338294
AB  - Differential item functioning (DIF) is an important issue in large scale standardized testing. DIF refers to the unexpected difference in item performances among groups of equally proficient examinees, usually classified by ethnicity or gender. Its presence could seriously affect the validity of inferences drawn from a test. Various statistical methods have been proposed to detect and estimate DIF.    This dissertation addresses DIF analysis in the context of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whose item selection algorithm adapts to the ability level of each individual examinee. In a CAT, a DIF item may be more consequential and more detrimental be cause fewer items are administered in a CAT than in a traditional paper-and-pencil test and because the remaining sequence of items presented to examinees depends in part on their responses to the DIF item. Consequently, an efficient, stable and flexible method to detect and estimate CAT DIF becomes necessary and increasingly important.    We propose simultaneous implementations of online calibration and DIF testing. The idea is to perform online calibration of an item of interest separately in the focal and reference groups. Under any specific parametric IRT model, we can use the (online) estimated latent traits as covariates and fit a nonlinear regression model to each of the two groups. Because of the use of the estimated, not the true &thetas;, the regression fit has to adjust for the covariate “measurement errors”. It turns out that this situation fits nicely into the framework of nonlinear error-in-variable modelling, which has been extensively studied in statistical literature.    We develop two bias-correction methods using asymptotic expansion and conditional score theory. After correcting the bias caused by measurement error, one can perform a significance test to detect DIF with the parameter estimates for different groups. This dissertation also discusses some general techniques to handle measurement error modelling with different IRT models, including the three-parameter normal ogive model and polytomous response models. Several methods of estimating DIF are studied as well.    Large sample properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies show that the resulting methods perform well in terms of Type-I error rate control, accuracy in estimating DIF and power against both unidirectional and crossing DIF.

T1  - The implications of the use of non -optimal items in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment
AN  - 276279115
AB  - This study describes the effects of manipulating item difficulty in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment. There are many potential benefits when using CATS as compared to traditional tests. These include increased security, shorter tests, and more precise measurement. According to IRT, the theory underlying CAT, as the computer continually recalculates ability, items that match that current estimate of ability are administered. Such items provide maximum information about examinees during the test. Herein, however, lies a potential problem. These optimal CAT items result in an examinee having only a 50% chance of a correct response. Some examinees may consider such items unduly challenging. Further, when test anxiety is a factor, it is possible that test scores may be negatively affected.    This research was undertaken to determine the effects of administering easier CAT items on ability estimation and test length using computer simulations. Also considered was the administration of different numbers of initial items prior to the start of the adaptive portion of the test, using three different levels of measurement precision.    Results indicate that regardless of the number of initial items administered, the level of precision employed, or the modifications made to item difficulty, the approximation of estimated ability to true ability is good in all cases. Additionally, the standard deviations of the ability estimates closely approximate the theoretical levels of precision used as stopping rules for the simulated CATs.    Since optimal CAT items are not used, each item administered provides less information about examinees than optimal CAT items. This results in longer tests. Fortunately, using easier items that provide up to a 66.4% chance of a correct response results in tests that only modestly increase in length, across levels of precision. For larger standard errors, even easier items (up to a 73.5% chance of a correct response) result in only negligible to modest increases in test length.    Examinees who find optimal CAT items difficult or examinees with test anxiety may find CATs that implement easier items enhance the already existing benefits of CAT.

T1  - Differences Between Self-Adapted and Computerized Adaptive Tests: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 57298712; 200920118
AB  - Self-adapted testing has been described as a variation of computerized adaptive testing that reduces test anxiety and thereby enhances test performance. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of these proposed effects of self-adapted tests (SATs); meta-analysis procedures were used to estimate differences between SATs and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in proficiency estimates and post-test anxiety levels across studies in which these two types of tests have been compared. After controlling for measurement error, the results showed that SATs yielded proficiency estimates that were 0.12 standard deviation units higher and post-test anxiety levels that were 0.19 standard deviation units lower than those yielded by CATs. We speculate about possible reasons for these differences and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using SATs in operational settings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Effects of Changes in the Examinees' Ability Distribution on the Exposure Control Methods in CAT
AN  - 62355853; ED453228
AB  - To satisfy the security requirements of computerized adaptive tests (CATs), efforts have been made to control the exposure rates of optimal items directly by incorporating statistical methods into the item selection procedure. Since differences are likely to occur between the exposure control parameter derivation stage and the operational CAT administrations, the exposure control methods may not fully accomplish the goal of controlling item exposure. This study explored the effects of the distribution changes on the performance of the Sympson and Hetter (SH) (J. Sympson and R. Hetter, 1985) and the Davey and Parshall (DP) (T. Davey and C. Parshall, 1995) procedures and provided an examination of the assertion that the Stocking and Lewis (M. Stocking and C. Lewis, 1998) conditional multinomial (SLC) procedure would function independently of an real examinee population. Simulations were carried out for this study using various combinations of the intended and real ability distributions. The results show that the changes in the examinees' ability distribution affected both SH and DP procedures in their control of the observed maximum exposure rates, and the effects were more profound for the SH method. The performance of the SLC method was demonstrated to be independent of the examinee's ability distributions in the operational CAT administrations. Contains 19 references, 5 tables, and 4 figures.

T1  - Computerized -adaptive versus paper -and -pencil testing environments: An experimental analysis of examinee experience
AN  - 250988108
AB  - Computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) is quickly becoming the test mode of choice among many high-stakes testing agencies. Although some researchers suggest that CAT is comparable, if not better, than traditional paper-and-pencil testing, others have suggested that individual differences among examinees have not been fully explored. In particular, the additional cognitive demands imposed by CAT are not well understood. For example, in the CAT mode there is the added demand of moving back and forth from computer screen to scrap paper when one has to solve more complex problems. In traditional paper and-pencil (P&P) testing environments, there is but one mode with which to contend: paper-and-pencil. In addition, CAT may generate greater anxiety—which further increases cognitive load—among some test-takers than would be found with more traditional testing modes. For example, with CAT you cannot go back to review previous items or change previous answers. And CAT requires something that is anxiety provoking in and of itself for some individuals: use of a computer.    The purpose of this study was to explore the effects, particularly the cognitive effects, of different testing environments on individual test-taker experience. Forty undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions: CAT mode or P&P testing mode. All subjects took the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination. Methodology for the study included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil instruments, videotaped recording of subject behavior, observation, and interview. Verbal protocol analysis of subsamples of subjects' work-toward-solution behavior on two analytical reasoning problems was also included.    Results of multivariate and univariate analyses suggest significant differences across test mode, with respect to cognitive demands. Compared to subjects in the paper-and-pencil test mode, CAT subjects had significantly longer response times on analytical reasoning (AR) problems, relied more on scrap paper to model AR problems diagrammatically, and employed different problem-solving strategies. Differences in affective responses—including anxiety and frustration—further suggest test mode effects were present. CAT subjects expressed significantly more frustration with the test mode than did their P&P counterparts. Furthermore, CAT subjects with low computer confidence experienced significantly higher levels of test anxiety than did their more computer-confident peers. Implications for test developers and recommendations for further research are offered.

T1  - A ‘rearrangement procedure’ for administering adaptive tests when review options are permitted
AN  - 250951635
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained increased popularity during the last decades. Consequently, admissions tests such as the GRE, the TOEFL, as well as other certification and licensure exams have been transformed from their paper-and-pencil versions to computerized adaptive versions. However, a major difference between the two test formats, from an examinee's point of view, is that examinees are usually not allowed to revise their answers on CATs. Some researchers feel that the validity of a CAT can increase with item review, since it allows them to rethink their answers and make corrections to items that have been misread or miskeyed. Other researchers believe that item review can decrease the efficiency and validity of a CAT since item review allows examinees to cheat on the test.    The purpose of this study was to test the efficiency of a ‘ rearrangement procedure’ that rearranges and skips certain items in order to better estimate the examinees' abilities. This was examined through a simulation study. This rearrangement procedure permits examinees to change their answers on a CAT without allowing them to artificially inflate their test scores. If this procedure were adopted, it could help reduce the stress of examinees who feel that they have more control over the testing situation when they can revise their answers. This procedure could also help improve the reliability and validity of the CAT since errors due to misread and miskeyed answers would be corrected.    The results of this simulation study have shown that when the Maximum Likelihood estimation was used, the rearrangement procedure was effective in reducing the bias of the ability estimates. With the Bayesian estimation, the rearrangement procedure increased the reliability, and slightly decreased the standard error of the estimates. However, the Bayesian method was not effective in reducing the bias of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure.    There were not many differences in the accuracy of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure, when three or five items were reviewed. There were also very small differences in the effects that the item pool size had on the accuracy of the ability estimates after the rearrangement procedure.

T1  - Applicant reactions to novel selection tools
AN  - 304615853
AB  - Organizations are increasingly using novel tools (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in designing selection systems. While there is great interest in using these tools, there is little research to indicate how applicants react to them. As applicant reactions have been shown to affect a number of variables important to organizations (e.g., test fairness, job acceptance, productivity, recommendation intentions), it is important to understand what determines these reactions. A framework was developed to highlight a number of antecedents to, types of, and consequences of reactions to novel testing. The current study has a 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil - computerized) x 2 (perceived technical level of the job: high technical job - low technical job) x 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design. While test-takers' post-test perceptions do not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, factors such as computer anxiety and experience were shown to be important factors in determining success in the selection process. Results show the significant relationships between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing novel selection tools in an applicant setting.

T1  - Impact of Local Item Dependence on Item Response Theory Scoring in CAT. Law School Admission Council Computerized Testing Report. LSAC Research Report Series
AN  - 62188696; ED467817
AB  - This study represented a first attempt to evaluate the impact of local item dependence (LID) for Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The most basic CAT design and a simplified design for simulating CAT item pools with varying degrees of LID were applied. A data generation method that allows the LID among items to be defined was applied to generate five CAT item pools. The LID exhibited by these pools ranged from zero LID (complete local item independence) to extreme LID. Results indicate that for certain types of scoring an extreme amount of LID may adversely impact the final score obtained by the examinee. The estimated precision of the test was also affected by the extreme LID level studied here. For the medium level of LID, structured to display the amount of LID typically displayed by the Law School Admission Test, the effects of the LID were not troublesome.

T1  - The development of a computerized version of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the effect of visuo -spatial working memory loading
AN  - 304522650
AB  - This dissertation focused on the generation and evaluation of web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Memory and spatial visualization theory were explored in relation to the addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component.    Analysis of the data determined that there was a significant difference between scores on the MRT Computer and MRT Memory test. The addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component did significantly affect results at the .05 alpha level. Reliability and discrimination estimates were higher on the MRT Memory version. The computerization of the paper and pencil version on the MRT did not significantly effect scores but did effect the time required to complete the test.    The population utilized in the quasi-experiment consisted of 107 university students from eight institutions in engineering graphics related courses. The subjects completed two researcher developed, Web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the original paper and pencil version of the Mental Rotation Test. One version of the test included a visuo-spatial working memory loading.    Significant contributions of this study included developing and evaluating computerized versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Previous versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test did not take advantage of the ability of the computer to incorporate an interaction factor, such as a visuo-spatial working memory loading, into the test. The addition of an interaction factor results in a more discriminate test which will lend itself well to computerized adaptive testing practices.    Educators in engineering graphics related disciplines should strongly consider the use of spatial visualization tests to aid in establishing the effects of modern computer systems on fundamental design/drafting skills. Regular testing of spatial visualization skills will result assist in the creation of a more relevant curriculum. Computerized tests which are valid and reliable will assist in making this task feasible.

T1  - Simulating Nonmodel-Fitting Responses in a CAT Environment. ACT Research Report Series 98-10
AN  - 62483487; ED427042
AB  - This study developed a model to simulate nonmodel-fitting responses in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment, and to examine the effectiveness of the model. The underlying idea was to simulate examinees' test behaviors realistically. This study simulated a situation in which examinees are exposed to or are coached on test items before actual testing. The multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) (M. Reckase, 1985) model was adopted for this study. Test characteristic curves and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were investigated. The results indicate that the probability of an examinee responding to an item correctly and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were influenced by the severity and the number of affected items. The results also suggest that the proposed model might be an effective tool for investigating the issue of nonmodel-fitting responses in a CAT environment. (Contains 7 figures and 39 references.)

T1  - The Influence of a Semester Abroad on Reading Proficiency: A Descriptive Study
AN  - 85664874; 9902442
AB  - The effects on second language reading comprehension of studying in the target-language country were investigated. Beginning- through advanced-level subjects ([Ss] N = 21, aged 20-34) at the Center for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language at Beijing U came from North America & Europe. The main test instrument, the Computer Adaptive Test for Reading Chinese, is a HyperCard (Macintosh) computer program; its advantages are detailed. Additional data were obtained through interviews. Results show that 14 Ss improved comprehension from pre- to post-test, 5 remained at the same level, & 2 declined. The numerous factors potentially affecting outcomes include starting proficiency, nature of classroom instruction & materials, number of Ss, study & reading habits, motivation, & timing of assessments. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 10 References.

AB  - A survey of some of the issues in assessing second-language listening ability discusses & evaluates some of the methods & techniques used, & potential applications. Noting the inadequacy of current models, the common themes of skills hierarchies & listening as an interactive process dominate current research approaches. Major research issues are identified as (1) assessing higher level listening skills, (2) confounding of skills, (3) assessing listening in oral interaction, & (4) dealing with authenticity. Assessment tasks are constructed with focus on the factors affecting test performance & the practical issues of test construction. The potential of computer-adaptive assessment, computer-based dictation, & computer-adaptive tests with interactive capabilities are noted, as well as the use of video, underlining the importance of visual support for listening.

T1  - A study of two computerized adaptive tests within an item response theory framework
AN  - 304433174
AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an item response theory (IRT). Additionally this study examined the effect of repeated practice with ACCUPLACER on subsequent ACCUPLACER and COMPASS scores. General opinions of students toward ACCUPLACER and COMPASS and correlations between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and paper-and-pencil (P&P) formats were investigated.    Methods. The investigator sampled 517 ACCUPLACER tests in order to develop a large number of response patterns and scores. This data source was used to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers and consistency between item response patterns and test scores in ACCUPLACER. This study employed seven classes of developmental mathematics; specifically, three classes were the experimental group and four classes comprised the control group. As treatment, students from the experimental group practiced the ACCUPLACER four times during the quarter. Students from all seven classes took the preACCUPLACER, postACCUPLACER, preCOMPANION, postCOMPANION, postCOMPASS, and Developmental Final Examinations. All students responded to the Opinionnaires of the ACCUPLACER and COMPASS. Scores on SAT-Math, SAT-Verbal, and Collegiate Placement Examination were obtained from students' records.    Results. Test questions generated from all correct responses and test questions generated from all incorrect responses were disjoint. Starter questions were found to be moderately easy rather than average difficulty. Six of the twelve items were identical and appeared in the same position on many initially correct response patterns. Lower scores came from initially incorrect response patterns. Scores varied greatly within the same response pattern when different sequences of items were given. A total of 108 different items were found, not the expected 214 items. Several starter questions appeared as later items in tests with primarily incorrect responses. Some correlations between CAT and P&P formats were significant $(p < .05).$ Students found that instructions and graphics were unclear on CATs.    Conclusions. The results of this study are not consistent with five of the purported claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an IRT framework. Several sets of scores within the same response pattern widely varied. Repeated practice on a CAT did not affect subsequent CAT scores. Correlations between CAT and P&P formats indicate that one format of testing is not a good predictor of the other form of testing. Remedial students find CATs difficult to understand.

T1  - A comparative study of item exposure control methods in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 304414840
AB  - This study investigated and compared the properties of five methods of item exposure control within the purview of estimating examinees' abilities in a CAT context. Simulations were used to carry out this research. The item pools were constructed based on item parameters calibrated from the existing paper-and-pencil ACT Assessment Mathematics Test. Each of the exposure control algorithms was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed according to the CAT design established for this study. The merits and shortcomings of these strategies were considered under two item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of item security, test overlap rates, pool utilization, and the conditional standard errors of measurement, bias, and root mean squared errors.    The general observations revealed that the randomization technique did not better ensure item security to any noticeable extent than the procedure without exposure control. The Sympson and Hetter and the Stocking and Lewis unconditional multinomial procedures produced very similar results under all conditions. However, when developing the exposure control parameters, the Sympson and Hetter method was much more efficient. The results yielded by the Davey and Parshall procedure were in general favorable. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates, but this came at the price of decreases in precision due to the strict control of item exposure.    The performance of the various methods was affected differentially by the size of the item pool. Also, the comparative properties of the various methods were not consistent under the two desired exposure rate conditions. These differential effects might be attributed to the specific features of the algorithms in combination with the structure of the item pool.    Each method had its advantages and disadvantages, but none possessed all desired characteristics. There was a clear and logical trade-off between exposure control and measurement precision. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure, and to a slightly lesser extent, the Davey and Parshall method seemed to be the most promising considering all factors this study addressed.

T1  - Overview of Practical Issues in a CAT Program
AN  - 62624506; ED408330
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

T1  - Examinee Issues in CAT
AN  - 62603310; ED408329
AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

T1  - An investigation of selected variables to predict student performance on the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) in one baccalaureate degree nursing program
AN  - 304377477
AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well academic, demographic, and programmatic variables could explain and predict variation in graduate performance on NCLEX-RN in one baccalaureate nursing program. The study specifically sought to address the void in empirical research in the area of programmatic variables predictive of NCLEX-RN performance. The study also investigated whether the changes made in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to computer adaptive testing (CAT), which was initiated in 1994, could help explain variations experience in program pass rate between 1990 and 1996.    The population was composed of 360 May and June graduates from one baccalaureate nursing program. The research method used in this study was an archival survey.    Analysis of t-tests and z-tests showed that the two outcome groups (pass group and fail group) differed significantly (p $<$.05) in terms of gender and ethnicity. Moreover, the two groups differed significantly in terms of many academic variables (ACT Composite score; admission, freshman, sophomore, junior, cumulative, nursing and science GPA's; and number of nursing and support courses repeated). In the final logistic regression model, four of the independent variables; gender (SEX), nursing GPA, number of nursing and support courses repeated (REPEAT), and the mean educational level of the clinical nursing faculty (C-ED), were found to be significant predictors of NCLEX-RN performance (p $<$.05; one-tailed probability). The author concluded that male and minority students, and student who have repeated nursing and support courses, are at risk for failure on NCLEX-RN. Additionally, because the education of the clinical faculty proved to affect graduate odds for success on NCLEX-RN, it was recommended that programs strive to attract, recruit, and retain highly qualified clinical faculty.    When added to the regression equation, the version of the NCLEX-RN did not prove to be statistically significant. The researcher concluded, therefore, that the change in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to CAT did not contribute to the variations in the NCLEX-RN pass rate experienced by this nursing program.

T1  - Accuracy of parameter estimation on polytomous IRT models
AN  - 304356874
AB  - Procedures based on item response theory (IRT) are widely accepted for solving various measurement problems which cannot be solved using classical test theory (CTT) procedures. The desirable features of dichotomous IRT models over CTT are well known and have been documented by Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991). However, dichotomous IRT models are inappropriate for situations where items need to be scored in more than two categories. For example, in performance assessments, most of the scoring rubrics for performance assessment require scoring of examinee's responses in ordered categories. In addition, polytomous IRT models are useful for assessing an examinee's partial knowledge or levels of mastery. However, the successful application of polytomous IRT models to practical situations depends on the availability of reasonable and well-behaved estimates of the parameters of the models. Therefore, in this study, the behavior of estimators of parameters in polytomous IRT models were examined.    In the first study, factors that affected the accuracy, variance, and bias of the marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimators in the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) were investigated. Overall, the results of the study showed that the MML estimators of the parameters of the GPCM, as obtained through the computer program, PARSCALE, performed well under various conditions. However, there was considerable bias in the estimates of the category parameters under all conditions investigated. The average bias did not decrease when sample size and test length increased. The bias contributed to large RMSE in the estimation of category parameters. Further studies need to be conducted to study the effect of bias in the estimates of parameters on the estimation of ability, the development of item banks, and on adaptive testing based on polytomous IRT models.    In the second study, the effectiveness of Bayesian procedures for estimating parameters in the GPCM was examined. The results showed that Bayes procedures provided more accurate estimates of parameters with small data sets. Priors on the slope parameters, while having only a modest effect on the accuracy of estimation of slope parameters, had a very positive effect on the accuracy of estimation of the step difficulty parameters.

T1  - A Critical Analysis of the Arguments for and against Item Review in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62583642; ED400267
AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT.

T1  - The effects of person misfit in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 304265537
AB  - In the past several years many statistical indices have been developed that attempt to quantify the extent to which responses to questions on a test fit the underlying test model. This area of research is commonly referred to as person fit.    Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a test administration procedure in which questions are selected from a pool of available questions depending on how an examinee has responded to previous test questions. Thus, within the CAT environment each examinee is administered a tailored or dynamic test that is unique compared to other examinees' tests.    Previous researchers have not investigated the issue of person fit within the context of CAT. The present study was a monte carlo investigation that simulated nonmodel-fitting responses within the CAT environment under a variety of conditions. The independent variables in this investigation were (1) the number of nonmodel-fitting responses, (2) the location of the nonmodel-fitting responses, (3) the point in the CAT process at which testing terminated, and (4) the entry point used for the CAT. The dependent variables were (1) the number of questions administered, (2) accuracy of the estimates of examinees' location on the latent trait ability continuum ($\theta$), (3) each examinee's fit to the underlying model using the $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices, and (4) the distribution of $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices within the CAT environment.    It was found that when several nonmodel-fitting responses occurred early in the CAT procedure (i.e., warm-up effect) the recovery of $\theta$ was very poor. When a warm-up effect was simulated, not only did test length increase but also more examinees were identified as not fitting the model. Using a standard error of less than.20 to terminate the CAT resulted in estimated $\theta$ values that were biased and poorly estimated. Finally, the entry point used in the CAT administration did not seem to affect final ability estimates.    Future research should consider developing new indices to quantify the extent to which examinees fit the test model within the CAT environment, and new methods of simulated nonmodel-fitting response patterns within CAT.

T1  - The Estimation of Item Difficulty from Restricted CAT Calibration Samples
AN  - 62632850; ED386466
AB  - Whether the presence of bidimensionality has any effect on the adaptive recalibration of test items was studied through live-data simulation of computer adaptive testing (CAT) forms. The source data were examinee responses to the 298 scored multiple choice items of a licensure examination in a health care profession. Three 75-item part-forms, differing in the degree of bidimensionality, were constructed from the examination forms. The dimensionality of each item was determined based on principal factor loadings using W. F. Stout's (1987) procedure. Samples of 2,100 examinees from an U.S.-educated group and a predominantly foreign-educated group were used, with samples sizes of 100, 200, 400, and 1,000 used for the analyses. As expected, an increase in sample size resulted in greater agreement between calibration and bank b-values. It appeared that dimensionality affected adaptive recalibration. Results from this study varied depending on the dimensionality of the part-forms. Results also affirm the importance of a well-defined reference group for recalibration, since samples from varying ability ranges sometimes produced considerably different b-values. Three tables present details of the analyses. (Contains six references.) (SLD)

T1  - Practical Design and Implementation Considerations of a Computer Adaptive Foreign Language Test: The Monash/Melbourne French CAT
AN  - 750312360
AB  - While the psychometric and statistical models underlying the design of computer adaptive tests (CAT) are well understood, relatively few working models exist for the purpose of foreign language assessment. Likewise, little has been published concerning the practical considerations affecting the implementation of such tests. in the process of constructing the Monash/Melbourne French CAT, we discovered much about putting testing theory into practice. The present paper reports this experience in three parts. In a preliminary section, we describe the academic context in which the French CAT was created and trialed. This is followed by a detailed consideration of the test presentation platform and operating algorithms. Lastly, we give an evaluation of the first administration of the French CAT, accompanied by a discussion of the test's reliability and validity as a placement instrument for first year Australian university students.

T1  - The Relationships between Individual Difference Variables and Test Performance in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62742305; ED382623
AB  - The relationship between several individual difference variables and test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was studied with 208 South Korean college students. The general individual difference variable selected was test anxiety, and the math-related individual difference variables were mathematics aptitude, math test anxiety, and math self-concept. Computer-related individual difference variables were computer literacy, computer anxiety, and computer experience. The CAT was an algebra test. Test anxiety and other individual difference variables were measured with instruments translated into Korean for the study. The seven difference variables and their squares were submitted to an analysis using the RSQUARE Procedure from Statistical Analysis System software. Math aptitude, math self-concept, math test anxiety, and computer literacy, in that order, were significantly related to test performance using CAT, but test anxiety, computer experience, and computer anxiety were not. Results suggest that the relationship between individual difference variables and test performance using CAT may be curvilinear. Two tables present analysis results. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing Exploring Examinee Response Time Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling
AN  - 62566300; ED400287
AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

T1  - Technological Applications in Science Assessment
AN  - 62779434; ED361207
AB  - Educational technology has been a focus of development and research in science teaching and learning. This document reviews research dealing with computer and hypermedia applications to assessment in science education. The paper reports the findings first for computer applications for assessment and then for hypermedia applications in assessment. Computer applications include access to large test banks, evaluation of student data collected in laboratory exercises, microcomputer-administered diagnostic testing, effects of computer use on student motivation during computer-administered tests, and computerized adaptive testing. Hypermedia applications include interactive videodisc technology for teaching biology, assessing teachers' knowledge for certification purposes, problem-based learning in chemistry found in the "Hyperequation" project, and administering figural response test items to cell and molecular biology students. The summary describes three advantages for incorporating computer-assisted assessment: immediate student feedback, ease of test taking, and availability of another form of formative assessment. Users of computer-assisted assessment are cautioned that computer-generated tests can lull the teacher into simply testing low level recall knowledge, and that the linear nature of computer testing does not allow the student to go back and reflect upon particular items.

T1  - How Review Options and Administration Modes Influence Scores on Computerized Vocabulary Tests
AN  - 62917480; ED346161
AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

T1  - Computer-adaptive versus pencil and paper tests
AN  - 304053062
AB  - This dissertation examined the feasibility of using computer adaptive technology to administer certification examinations. The agenda for this research was (1) to compare a computer adaptive test (CAT) with paper and pencil (PAP) tests in terms of the comparability of item calibrations and the comparability of examinee ability estimates and (2) to examine the CAT under varying test conditions to determine whether modifications in traditional test design affect examinee performance.    Results show that PAP item calibrations were functionally equivalent to the CAT item calibrations even though items on the CAT were administered to varying numbers of examinees and appeared in different contexts for different examinees. Examinees performed comparably on the CAT and the PAP as evidenced by a.83 correlation, adjusted for measurement error, and a mean difference of.01 across the two modes of administration. There were no significant differences between the CAT and the PAP ability estimates due to sex, ethnic origin, age or whether or not English was the examinee's first language.    On the CAT, examinees were randomly placed in test design conditions in which the effects of altering the difficulty of the start, the difficulty of the test, the minimum test length and the option to skip, defer or review items were examined. There were no significant differences in examinee performance across these groups indicating that some of these design options may be viable for CAT.    Test length was reduced on the CAT without sacrificing confidence in the pass/fail decision. Test length on the PAP was 109 items; mean test length on the CAT was 66 items when the maximum test length was set at 100 items and 86 items when the maximum test length was set at 240 items.    Results from this study indicate that CAT can be an excellent way to administer certification exams. Examinees can benefit by being able to take shorter exams, scheduled at their convenience and receive immediate test results. For the certification board, CAT can improve data collection and test security, and provide greater confidence in pass/fail decisions.

T1  - The effect of adaptive testing item selection methods on the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation
AN  - 304000167
AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty.    The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data.    Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

T1  - Linguistic predictors of SAT antonym item difficulty: Identification and employment
AN  - 303987555
AB  - This research investigates the extent to which linguistic features of standardized test antonym items can be used to predict the empirical difficulty of these items. The study was motivated by both theoretical and practical considerations. Theoretically, exploring content-feature correlates of difficulty is a form of construct validation as such inquiry attends to the question of why an item is easy or difficult. The pursuit of evidential links between content and difficulty is a scientific, falsifiable approach to validation. In contrast, conventional response-based analyses do not address the central role played by item content in controlling difficulty. From a practical standpoint, detecting content-based predictors allows for the scaling of similarly constructed items without having to establish difficulty measurements via pretesting.    Twelve variables associated with stem and keyed answer words of 975 published SAT antonym items are considered. Results reveal that the stem word's standard frequency index (SFI) is the most robust predictor of empirical difficulty (as measured by Educational Testing Service's equated delta statistic), distantly followed by the keyed answer word's SFI and part of speech. Across all items, one-third of difficulty variance was explained by this predictor set, confirming the frequency-difficulty relationship reported in studies employing more common words and smaller samples. Prediction was attenuated by the relatively high proportion of words having low frequencies. Presumably, a larger representation of familiar words and more differentiated low frequency values would significantly improve prediction.    These findings suggest that feature-based scaling is an efficient, cost effective means for advancing local development of adaptive assessment systems. A computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system is suggested as one practical, psychometric application of the study's findings. The proposed system would extract verbal stimuli from an electronic word domain and employ the aforementioned word variables as proxies for vocabulary item difficulty. Among the design issues discussed are the automatic construction of vocabulary items, adaptive branching, sequential decision-making, iterative refinement of item calibrations, and the provision of timely output for formative direction of learning and instruction.

T1  - Loudness of quasi-continuous impulse noise
AN  - 303926746
AB  - The loudness of quasi continuous impulse noise has been studied as a function of impulse duration and repetition rate, and the spectral shape and relative level of steady background noise. The measurements were performed on 1-second trains of white-noise bursts with exponentially decaying envelopes. The repetition rates were 5 to 100 Hz. The impulse durations were adjusted so that the duty factor of the impulse train (product of the repetition rate and the effective duration of the impulses) varied from 0.025 to 0.1. Steady white background noise was added at peak-to-background ratios of 10, 20 and 30 dB. The loudness levels of the stimuli relative to a steady white noise reference stimulus at a presentation level of 60.5 dB L$\sb{\rm eq}$ were measured in ten normal-hearing subjects using an adaptive testing procedure.    Under most conditions, the loudness levels of the quasi continuous impulse noise stimuli were best predicted by the equivalent sound pressure level, L$\sb{\rm eq}$, indicating that the "equal energy" relation was followed. At the 50 and 100-Hz repetition rates, the loudness level of the impulse noise test stimuli at the 20 and 30-dB peak-to-background ratios exceeded that of the reference stimulus due to the "roughness effect". The loudness levels of the stimuli at the lower repetition rates, on the other hand, was significantly less than the equal energy prediction at the shortest durations, which suggests that auditory temporal integration depends on the duty factor of the impulse train. The data of experiment 1 were fit by a simple model involving the duty factor of the impulse train and the difference between the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the impulsive component and the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the steady background noise component of the test stimuli.    In the second experiment, the spectral shape of the background noise did not significantly affect the point of subjective equality. However, there was a significant interaction between background noise spectrum and peak-to-background noise ratio which was suggestive of a masking process.

T1  - Investigating Differences in Mean Score on Adaptive and Paper and Pencil Versions of the College Level Academic Skills Reading Test
AN  - 63059154; ED319791
AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

T1  - Test Anxiety and Item Order: New Parameters for Item Response Theory
AN  - 63129829; ED307313
AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

T1  - Work hardening, strength, restorative mechanisms, and ductility in the hot working of 300 series stainless steels
AN  - 303829589
AB  - Stress-strain curves, generated through continuous and multistage torsion tests of as-cast and homogenized 301, 304, 316 and 317 $\gamma$ stainless steels in the range of 1200-900$\sp\circ$C and 0.1 to 5.0 s$\sp{\rm -1}$, were analyzed with respect to the characteristics of work hardening, dynamic and static recovery, dynamic and static recrystallization, and ductility. Work hardening was related to the Kocks-Mecking analysis. The associated enthalpy which rose across the deformation range attaining a maximum at the highest temperature, was in close agreement with the constant activation energy determined by sinh analysis.    Dynamic softening mechanisms were analyzed through examination of the flow curves, with conclusions based upon mechanical data being confirmed by optical metallographic methods. Upon attaining a critical strain, dynamic recrystallization DRX was initiated, producing a peak and then softening to a steady state regime. The rate of dynamic softening was determined by means of the Avrami equation. The critical stress and strain for subgrain formation and for DRX were determined from changes in slope of the strain hardening-flow stress $\theta$-$\sigma$ curves. A transition from multiple peak grain coarsening to single peak grain refinement behavior was observed and analyzed.    Static restorative mechanisms were examined by mechanical metallographic methods. Fractional softening was due to both static recovery SRV and static recrystallization SRX. The kinetics were analyzed through use of the Avrami equation. At low strains, the time for 50% SRX was a strong function of strain to the $-2$ power. In addition, the temperature compensated time for SRX depended upon the three-eights power of the Zener-Hollomon parameter for both isothermal and declining temperature T multistage tests.    Simulation of a cross country mill showed that multistage flow curves increased as strain rate rose and as interval time and T declined, particularly below 1050$\sp\circ$C. Since the time between successive planetary rolls is insufficient for any restorative mechanisms to operate, the instantaneous power requirements for the planetary hot rolling mill were determined from continuous flow curves. The results favorably agreed with similar mills installed in both Canada and Japan.

T1  - Local independence and item context in a simulated adaptive version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
AN  - 303794941
AB  - The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was evaluated for Item Response Theory (IRT) assumptions, local independence and parameter invariance in order to determine the feasibility of developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version. Three conditions were studied including two simulated CAT versions and a standard version (Form R). A sex difference was noted across all groups, but item order did not otherwise affect scores which were highly correlated with the IRT based scores. After excluding those items which did not fit the model, the local independence assumption generally held across groups, and since the procedure used to assess local independence was also sensitive to multidimensionality, this provides implied support for unidimensionality of the various scales. The procedures used to investigate item order effects and parameter invariance yielded mixed results. Overall, this study provides evidence favorable to a CAT adaptation of the MMPI, and suggestions for further research are discussed.

T1  - The contribution of matric suction to the shear strength of unsaturated soils
AN  - 303722305
AB  - The shear strength of remolded specimens of an unsaturated, silty, copper tailings sand was measured in a triaxial apparatus. Multistage tests were completed under consolidated-drained (CD) conditions, where both the pore air and pore water pressures were controlled, and under constant water content (CW) conditions, where the specimen was drained with respect to the pore air pressure and undrained with respect to the pore water pressure. A triaxial testing system with automatic data capturing capabilities was assembled for the study.    A total of eight specimens were tested, two in a saturated condition and three each under unsaturated CD and CW conditions, respectively. The saturated specimens were staged with respect to increasing effective stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$), while each unsaturated specimen was tested with a constant value of net applied stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$), and increasing values of matric suction (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) from stage to stage. The range of net applied stress and matric suction studied was 15 to 150 kPa.    The parameter $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ quantifies the increase in shear strength which can be attributed to the matric suction stress state variable. The results indicated that the intersection of the failure surface with the plane containing the (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) axis was curved over the range of suction studied, and did not differ appreciably between the CD and CW test methods. This demonstrated uniqueness of the failure surface.    When account was made for a slight curvature in the failure surface in the direction of the ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$) axis, the variation in $\phi\sp\prime$ with respect to (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) was reduced. This supported the concept of independence of the shear strength parameters $\phi\sp\prime$, c$\sp\prime$, and $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ for unsaturated soils, and verified the form of the shear strength equation used in the study (Fredlund, Morgenstern, and Widger, 1978).

T1  - Simulation of hot strip rolling by compression testing: Effect of the variation of strain-rate on the constitutive behaviour of a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel
AN  - 276038323
AB  - The major objective of this investigation was to test experimentally the relative validity of simulating hot strip rolling by compression testing at constant true strain rates under axisymmetric conditions.    For the purpose of the simulation, the material's flow through the roll gap was theoretically modelled.    Isothermal, single- and multi-stage compression tests were carried out on a microprocessor-controlled servohydraulic testing system by using a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel. Cylindrical specimens were subjected to deformation at rates of strain either constant or varying as during a rolling pass/passes. True stress-true strain flow curves were obtained by correcting the measured stress-strain data for the effect of friction at the specimen/die interface. The constant friction shear factor was determined quantitatively by hot ring tests. Optical microscopy was used to observe the prior austenite microstructures.    Based on the results of single-stage, constant true strain-rate tests, the dependence of the flow strength as a function of strain, rate of strain and temperature was modelled by using an Arrhenius-type equation.    The comparison of the responses of the material to the two types of compression revealed no significant differences between flow curves except at the very end of the tests. This observation agreed with the predictions of the model, which was developed based on the constant strain-rate flow curves, indicating that the material follows a mechanical equation of state in hot rolling processes.    The flow curves and the average flow strengths were compared between the constant and varying strain-rate, four-stage tests. Differences were also found negligible. The variation of the average flow strength during multistage testing was dependent of the length of the interpass time and the average strain rate in a significant manner.    It was found that the microstructures developed from single- as well as multi-stage compression tests were independent of the variation of the strain rate during deformation.    This study showed that the constant true strain-rate compression testing is a very useful technique in simulating hot flat strip rolling processes.

T1  - REMEDIATION IN BASIC SKILLS MATHEMATICS WITH AND WITHOUT COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION (CAI, TUTORING, INDEPENDENT-STUDY)
AN  - 303437375
AB  - This study focused on the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in remedial mathematics when compared with tutoring and independent-study as methods of instruction. In this investigation, the relationship between these three methods of instruction and the ethnicity of the subjects was explored.    Results were measured by analyzing differences in achievement scores as measured by Computer Adaptive Testing and Comparative Guidance Placement. The results showed that there was a significant difference between minority and non-minorities for both tutoring and independent-study. Such differences are frequently encountered and are generally attributable to cultural differences or prior educational experiences, which may cause some minority students to experience emotional and value conflicts in the classroom. This could result in psychological defenses being called into play. No significant differences in test scores were apparent between minorities and non-minorities when using CAI as the method of instruction, indicating that CAI may not activate such defenses.    Results also showed that minorities scored significantly higher in testing after using CAI as a method of instruction than after using tutoring or independent-study methods. This suggests that CAI, when used for remedial instruction in basic skills mathematics, reduces the frequently encountered differences in achievement between minorities and non-minorities. This supports the theory that CAI is multicultural and a value-neutral tool that can assist to alleviate some of these pre-existing problems, thereby enabling minority students to attain greater academic success.

T1  - National Statistics to Improve Educational Productivity
AN  - 63304897; ED272571
AB  - The value of statistical research depends on valid comparisons which can usefully influence educational policy. Educational research needs to extend the measures of learning (such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress) through nationally-calibrated absolute measures and through computer-assisted and adaptive testing. Direct sampling by computer would make educational polls and national assessment faster and less expensive. A national bureau of educational standards might be founded to collect, coordinate, calibrate, archive, analyze, synthesize, and make available the data that is needed to improve educational productivity. Nine factors promoting efficiency and productivity of learning are classified in three broad categories: (1) student aptitude, including ability, development, and motivation; (2) instruction, including amount of time students engage in learning and quality of instructional experience; and (3) environmental factors, such as home climate, classroom social group, peer group, and television viewing. The tables in the appendix illustrate the effect of productivity factors on achievement revealed by quantitative syntheses carried out by a number of investigators in Australia, Canada and the United States during the past decade.

T1  - TEACHER AND STUDENT RESPONSES TO A SYSTEM FOR RATIONAL MEASUREMENT
AN  - 303459373
AB  - Feedback is a key element in the teaching/learning cycle. It tells teachers and students how they are progressing and how effective their instruction/learning has been. Despite the importance of feedback, it is rarely obtained in optimal ways and is poorly understood by teachers and students. The problem lies in ineffective methods of obtaining and utilizing feedback information.    This study has attempted to define, implement, and determine the effects of a set of rational measurement practices. It is based on the premise that testing should be an integral part of teaching, providing information to students and teachers in an efficient and non-intrusive manner. The components for rational measurement include well-written item sets which communicate teachers'expectations to students, individualized selection of items, detailed comments on student answers, and reports portraying the changing relationship of students to items as instruction proceeds. The system utilizes a microcomputer programmed with an algorithm for Rasch measurement and adaptive testing.    Nine classes participated in a study of the effectiveness of the system. After training, each teacher wrote item sets corresponding to two units. Qualitative data were gathered on teachers' use of measurement information for improving teaching practice. Teacher proficiency in writing items was measured. Students within classes were randomly assigned to four groups created by the crossing of a feedback factor and an item selection factor. Students were tested weekly with subsets of items from the set written by the teacher. Ability measures were obtained from each session to determine whether detailed feedback was effective in raising achievement. Attitude and anxiety data were collected at the beginning and end of each unit to assess whether adaptive item selection caused a more positive student reaction to testing.    Data analysis showed that four teachers used the system to improve their teaching. Three teachers displayed positive verbal responses, but did not change practices. Two teachers did not use the measurement information. There was no discernible increase in item-writing proficiency. Analysis of student data showed a nonsignificant positive effect of detailed feedback on student achievement. No difference between selection or feedback groups was observed for any affective measures.

T1  - The stability of a silty clay under repeated loading
AN  - 2312324222
AB  - The object of this research programme was to investigate the stability of a silty clay under undrained repeated loading. Equipment has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading. This model can be used to predict pore pressures and failure for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils.
