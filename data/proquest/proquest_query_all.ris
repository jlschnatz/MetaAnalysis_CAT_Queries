T1  - Lessons Learned about the Application of Adaptive Testing in Several First-Year University Courses
AN  - 2699690168; EJ1340821
AB  - The adoption of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) instead of classical testing (FIT) raises questions from both teachers' and students' perspectives. The scientific literature shows that teachers using CAT instead of FIT should experience shorter times to complete the assessment and obtain more precise evaluations. As for the students, adaptive testing seems to increase their engagement, whereas the impossibility to revise the already given questions is usually seen as a detrimental characteristic. In such a context, the paper reports on a study concerning the aforementioned points. The outcomes seem almost all inline with the literature: no particular usability issues were detected, CAT is faster than FIT, and CAT does not seem more engaging than FIT. All these findings are reported in the conclusions as a list of suggestions to teachers interested in switching from FIT to CAT.

T1  - The Optimal Item Pool Design in Multistage Computerized Adaptive Tests with the "p"-Optimality Method
AN  - 2458992849; EJ1263711
AB  - The present study extended the "p"-optimality method to the multistage computerized adaptive test (MST) context in developing optimal item pools to support different MST panel designs under different test configurations. Using the Rasch model, simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 simulated optimal item pools were generated and evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. Results showed that the optimal item pools built with the "p"-optimality method provide sufficient measurement accuracy under all simulated MST panel designs. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but not the item distributions and item pool characteristics. This study demonstrated that the "p"-optimality method can adapt to MST item pool design, facilitate the MST assembly process, and improve its scoring accuracy.

T1  - Investigating Hybrid Test Designs in Passage-Based Adaptive Tests
AN  - 2449482082
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) selects each item to match with an examinee’s ability level during the test. In contrast, multistage adaptive testing (MST) administers a group of items instead of each individual item adaptively. A hybrid design combines CAT and MST borrowing strengths from both testing modes. However, existing research studies indicate that there is lack of knowledge on hybrid designs in passage-based adaptive testing, including situations where misrouting occurs. Misrouting refers to when examinees get routed to paths that don’t match with their true ability levels. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the proposed hybrid designs (HMCAT designs) with respect to ability estimation accuracy under different MST configurations and their performance when misrouting occurs.
The HMCAT designs under passage-based adaptive testing control test adaptability at both passage/stimulus level and item level. Four proposed HMCAT designs differ by implementing the item level CAT at different stages of the MST. Specifically, among all four designs, the two most extreme designs are the one implementing CAT across all stages (CC) and the one not implementing CAT across any stage (PP). The two hybrid designs include implementing CAT only in the routing stage (CP) and implementing CAT only in the last stage (PC). The hybrid designs’ performance compared to that of the CC design and the PP design when interacting with different MST configurations and when misrouting occurs are the two main research questions of the study. 
The three-phase simulation analysis indicates that (1) the PC design achieves more accurate final ability estimation results under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (2) although the CP design fails to perform effectively when misrouting occurs under the three-stage MST configuration, it is still able to achieve accurate final ability estimation results under both two-stage MST configurations; (3) the CC design and the PP design achieve similar and the most accurate final ability estimation results under all four MST configurations; (4) the PC design reaches similar accuracy as the CC design and the PP design under the three-stage and the four-stage MST configurations; (5) the CP design reaches a similar accuracy level as the CC design and the PP design under both two-stage MST configurations; (6) the CP design is affected the most when misrouting occurs in the three-stage MST configuration, whereas the other three HMCAT designs are not affected. 
In general, findings from simulation analyses suggest that the HMCAT designs are effective enough to use in passage/stimulus-based adaptive tests with appropriate MST configurations. They also contain advantages such as greater flexibility with respect to content balancing, test security and control on item administration. However, it is important to understand that the performance of HMCAT designs can heavily depend on the MST configuration, the item pool characteristics, the test design and components in the test administration algorithm, such as content balancing strategies. Results from the current study provide implications for practitioners on how to decide on an appropriate HMCAT design under real testing contexts and how to evaluate and maintain the selected HMCAT design to effectively implement the design in practice.

T1  - Diagnostic Tools for Improving the Amount of Adaptation in Adaptive Tests Using Overall and Conditional Indices of Adaptation
AN  - 2288850151
AB  - In recent years, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has been widely used in educational and clinical settings. The basic idea of CAT is relatively straightforward. A computer is used to administer items tailored for individuals to maximize the measurement precision of their proficiency estimates. However, the administration of CAT is not so simple. Those who administer CATs must, while trying to optimize an item selection criterion, consider a variety of practical issues such as test security, content balancing, the purpose of testing, and other test specifications. Such extraneous factors make it possible that a CAT might have so many constraints that in practice it is barely adaptive at all. This concern is at the forefront of the current study, which poses two key questions: How adaptive is a highly adaptive test really? How can the level of adaptation be improved? 
This study aims to develop three new statistical indicators to measure the amount of adaptation conditional on the examinees’ proficiency levels in CAT. It also aims to evaluate the feasibility and utility of these adaptation measures in helping to diagnose and improve adaptivity that occurs during the CAT administration. Extending work done by Reckase, Ju, and Kim (2018), the proposed measures are based on three components—the differences in the locations between the selected items and the examinee’s current proficiency estimates, the variations in the item locations administered to each examinee, and the magnitude of information that the test presents to each examinee. Hence, they can be used to assess adaptivity during the CAT process, as well as to identify differences in the level of adaptation for individuals or subgroups of examinees. 
To demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptation indices, this study conducted analyses of real operational testing data from a healthcare licensure examination, as well as comprehensive simulation studies under various conditions that affect adaptivity in a CAT. The key findings of the study suggest that the proposed adaptation indices are likely to function as intended to sensitively detect the magnitude of adaptivity for a CAT over the proficiency continuum. These new measures shed light on how much adaptation of a given test occurs across individual proficiency levels or subpopulations. With some guidelines for the interpretation of these measures recommended in this study, the adaptation indices can also readily serve as diagnostic tools in practice for helping test practitioners design item pools and adaptive tests that support high adaptivity.

T1  - An Adaptive Test Analysis Based on Students' Motivation
AN  - 2461133504; EJ1195643
AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

T1  - Mediating Effects of Individuals' Ability Levels on the Relationship of Reflective-Impulsive Cognitive Style and Item Response Time in CAT
AN  - 2155989774; EJ1193878
AB  - This study focused on the effect of examinees' ability levels on the relationship between Reflective-Impulsive (RI) cognitive style and item response time in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The total of 56 students majoring in Educational Technology from Shandong Normal University participated in this study, and their RI cognitive styles were diagnosed using the Matching Familiar Figures Test-20 (MFFT-20). Examinees' ability values and average item response time were recorded by the computerized adaptive testing system. Then mediation analysis was implemented and the findings revealed that there was direct and indirect effect between RI cognitive style and item response time in CAT. What is more, RI cognitive style also directly affected the ability levels, and then the ability levels impacted on item response time. So, examinee's ability level was partly a mediator between RI cognitive style and item response time. Furthermore, RI cognitive style of the examinees might also be diagnosed according to ability values and average item response time. The relevant research and implications were further discussed.

T1  - Computer-Adaptive Testing: Implications for Students' Achievement, Motivation, Engagement, and Subjective Test Experience
AN  - 2013521072; EJ1166166
AB  - The present study investigated the implications of computer-adaptive testing (operationalized by way of multistage adaptive testing; MAT) and "conventional" fixed order computer testing for various test-relevant outcomes in numeracy, including achievement, test-relevant motivation and engagement, and subjective test experience. It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students' test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students' test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged.

T1  - An overview of differential item functioning in multistage computer adaptive testing using three-parameter logistic item response theory
AN  - 1957207565
AB  - Testing is growing by leaps and bounds across the world. There is a realization that a nation’s well-being depends crucially on the educational achievement of its population. Valid tests are an essential tool to evaluate a nation’s educational standing and to implement efficacious educational reforms. Because tests consume time that otherwise could be devoted to instruction, it is important to devise tests that are efficient. Doing so requires a careful balancing of the contributions of technology, psychometrics, test design, and the learning sciences. Computer adaptive multistage testing (MSCAT) fits the bill extraordinarily well; unlike other forms of adaptive testing, it can be adapted to educational surveys and student testing. Research in this area will be an evidence that the methodologies and underlying technology that surround MSCAT have reached maturity and that there is a growing acceptance by the field of this type of test design. This state-of-the-art paper aims to present an overview of differential item functioning (DIF) in MSCAT using three-parameter logistic item response theory (IRT), offering suggestions to implement it in practice with a hope to motivate testing and assessment researchers and practitioners to initiate projects in this under-practiced area by helping them to better understand some of the relevant technical concepts.

T1  - Exploring the Opportunities for the Adaptive Assessment of Vocabulary Knowledge in an Educational Context
AN  - 2461131892; ED596664
AB  - Vocabulary knowledge assessment methods and instruments have gone through a significant evolution. Computer-based tests offer more opportunities than their paper-and-pencil counterparts, however, most digital vocabulary assessments are linear and adaptive solutions in this domain are scarce. The aims of this study were to compare the effectiveness of a multi-stage adaptive and a linear test system of vocabulary knowledge both at test and individual level and to examine the impact of the used assessment method on students' performance and motivation measured through the number of the right answers within a test. Data show that the adaptive test system provided a more accurate ability estimation with higher reliability, a more motivating test environment and more precision than the linear version.

T1  - Enhancing Item Pool Utilization When Designing Multistage Computerized Adaptive Tests
AN  - 2461125600; ED589689
AB  - In recent years, the multistage adaptive test (MST) has gained increasing popularity in the field of educational measurement and operational testing. MST refers to a test in which pre-constructed sets of items are administered adaptively and are scored as a unit (Hendrickson, 2007). As a special case of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), a MST program needs the following components: an item response theory (IRT) model or non-IRT-based alternatives; an item pool design; module assembly; ability estimation; routing algorithm; and scoring (Yan et al., 2014). A significant amount of research has been conducted on components like module assembly, ability estimation, routing and scoring, but few studies have addressed the component of item pool design. An item pool is defined as consisting of a maximal number of combinations of items that meet all content specifications for a test and provide sufficient item information for estimation at a series of ability levels (van der Linden et al., 2006). An item pool design is very important because any successful MST assembly is inseparable from an optimal item pool that provides sufficient and high-quality items (Luecht & Nungester, 1998). Reckase (2003, 2010) developed the p-optimality method to design optimal item pools using the unidimensional Rasch model in CAT, and it has been proved to be efficient for different item types and IRT models. The present study extended this method to MST context in supporting and developing different MST panel designs under different test configurations. The study compared the performance of the MST assembled under the most popularly studied panel designs in the literature, such as 1-2, 1-3, 1-2-2, and 1-2-3. A combination of short, medium and long tests with different routing test proportions were used to build up different tests. Using one of the most popularly investigated IRT models, the Rasch model, simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 optimal items pools were generated and the measurement accuracy was evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample using various statistical measures. The p-optimality method was also applied in an operational MST licensure test to see if it is feasible in supporting test assembly and achieving sufficient measurement accuracy in practice. Results showed that the different MST panel designs achieved sufficient measurement accuracy by using the items from the optimal item pools built with the p-optimality method. The same was true with the operational item pool. Measurement accuracy was related to test length, but not so much to the routing test proportions. Exposure control affected the item pool size, but the distributions of the item parameters and item pool characteristics for all the MST panel designs were similar under the two conditions. The item pool sizes under the exposure control conditions were several times larger than those under no exposure control, depending on the types of MST panel designs and routing test proportions. The results from this study provide information for how to enhance item pool utilization when designing multistage computerized adaptive tests, facilitating the MST assembly process, and improving the scoring accuracy.

T1  - Using the Rasch Model in a Computer Adaptive Testing Application to Enhance the Measurement Quality of Emotional Intelligence
AN  - 2566224349
AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

T1  - Data-adaptive SNP-set-based association tests of longitudinal traits
AN  - 1796355291
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been largely limited to investigating traits with a single time measurement. However, many prospective cohort studies and electronic health record (EHR)-based cohorts with GWAS data have collected traits with repeated measurements across follow-up time. Effectively utilizing the information embedded in the time trajectory of measurements could greatly increase the power of association testing. Local association signal patterns across the whole genome are usually variable, complicated and unpredictable, which underscores the need for a data adaptive test capable of maintaining high statistical power across different genetic architecture and association signal patterns. Furthermore, complex diseases are usually affected by multiple variants in a gene and multiple genes in a biological pathway. In addition, traditional single SNP-based association testing has very limited statistical power for variants of low to rare minor allele frequency (MAF < 5% or 1%). A SNP-set-based association test, e.g., based on genes or pathways, could boost the statistical power by aggregating individual weak to moderate association signals across a region of interest. In this dissertation, I have developed such powerful data-adaptive tests that address these analytical challenges facing association testing between longitudinal traits and rare or common variants. I implemented extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed tests, and illustrated their applications in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. I also produced a software package with documentation to implement the proposed tests in high performance computing platform. In conclusion, this dissertation paves a new path in extending the traditional association tests to longitudinal traits, helps identify novel genes and explain the missing heritability in human complex diseases.

T1  - Using Item Response Theory to Evaluate a Scale of Internalized Distress for Computer Adaptive Administration
AN  - 1748052920
AB  - There has been a notable lack of change in psychological assessment practices over the last several decades despite vast improvements in science and technology. The use of item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) in other testing domains has yielded positive results, but these practices have not gained widespread use in psychological assessment. Research has shown that the item response theory methodology can yield important information about assessments not available to researchers through classical test theory, and computer adaptive testing can result in significant item reductions and shorter test administration times. Thus, the current study evaluated whether a single set of items that measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with differential item functioning less than |±0.3| across the three demographic variables of gender, age, and education can be identified. Research has consistently shown that an internalized distress dimension is prevalent in the literature on self-rated mood, as well as in the MMPI-2 item pool. IRT analyses were used to investigate for age, gender, and education bias in a sample of 4,493 participants with 250 participants for most combinations of demographic variables (age [3], education [3], gender [2]). Age, education, and gender bias was most often seen in comparisons for participants in the 60 to 79 year old age group for all three scales. The Welsh Anxiety (A) scale showed the greatest number of items (19) with DIF greater than |±0.3|across the three demographic variables. Differential item functioning was most prevalent when there were significant disparities between the two groups being evaluated. Overall, results showed that there were 22 items that were relatively unbiased for each combination of demographic variables. Internalized Distress (ID) had the greatest number of unbiased items across the various combinations of demographic variables, with 19 items showing relatively no bias. These findings indicate that it is possible to develop a computer adaptive assessment to measure internalizing symptoms in a clinical sample with enough items that are free from bias for age, education, and gender. Further exploration of computer-adaptive administration of the MMPI-2 and other self-report inventories seems warranted because of its ability to provide comparable information frequently with considerable time saving for individuals.

T1  - Dimensionality of the Neuroticism Basic Traits Inventory Scale
AN  - 2572696586
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the dimensionality of the Neuroticism scale of the Basic Traits Inventory in order to contribute to the larger project of developing computer adaptive testing for the five scales of the Basic Traits Inventory. The Neuroticism scale comprises the general factor of Neuroticism and four group factors or facets, namely, Affective Instability, Depression, Self-Consciousness, and Anxiety (Taylor & De Bruin, 2006; Taylor & De Bruin, 2013).Personality constructs and scales are complex as they typically comprise heterogeneous items for reliability and validity purposes (Reise, Morizot, & Hays, 2007). It is therefore to be expected that some studies present evidence of a scale that measures an overarching single dimension – unidimensionality – whilst other studies find evidence of multiple dimensions – multidimensionality (Gibbons et al., 2007; Immekus & Imbrie, 2008; Reise, Moore, & Haviland, 2010). Consequently, specification of a strictly unidimensional model is often not realistic for complex personality constructs and scales. However, test-developers and researchers aspire to unidimensionality (Zinbarg, Yovel, Revelle, & McDonald, 2006) as unidimensionality allows for the unambiguous interpretation of scale scores (Reise et al., 2010), is considered a precondition to reliability and validity, encourages the use of a total score (Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma, 2003), meets the unidimensional assumption of item response theory models, and is the prerequisite for the development of computer adaptive testing (Thomas, 1990; Weiss & Gibbons, 2007).Against this background, the key question that was posed in this study was not whether the Neuroticism scale was strictly unidimensional or not, but rather if the scale was unidimensional enough to allow for the meaningful interpretation of a total score (Morizot, Ainsworth, & Reise, 2009). This study focussed on attaining evidence of the presence of a strong general factor which would justify the interpretation of a total score and for applying unidimensional item response theory models to the scale (Reise, 2012).The Basic Traits Inventory was completed by 1 966 participants from various industries and organisations within South Africa. Statistical analyses were performed on the responses to the Neuroticism scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to investigate the unidimensionality and strength of the general factor of the scale, while evaluating the influence of multidimensionality on the interpretation of the general factor or the total score. This dimensionality investigation of the scale was achieved by comparing three confirmatory factor models using the goodness-of-fit indices and the standardised factor loadings of the models. The competing structural models were: a one-factor or unidimensional model which represented the general factor and interpretation of a total score for the scale; a four-factor or multidimensional model which represented the multiple factors of the scale and therefore the interpretation of the group factors or facets; and a bifactor model which allowed for the examination of the strength of the general factor in comparison to that of the group factors of the scale.The results of this study confirmed that the Neuroticism scale is multidimensional as the scale comprises multiple group factors or facets. However, the findings of the study revealed the strong presence of a general factor that runs through all the items of the scale, and consequently suggest that efforts to make use of and interpret separate subscale scores lack the needed empirical evidence to do so. In essence, the findings of the study demonstrated that the presence of unidimensionality in the scale is prominent despite the multidimensionality of the scale, which confirmed that the interpretation of the total score for the scale is justified and preferred irrespective of the multidimensionality of the scale.Overall, the findings and evidence of this study proposed that the Neuroticism scale is unidimensional enough to meet the unidimensional assumption of item response theory models. Accordingly, these results support the advancement of adapting the Neuroticism scale of the Basic Traits Inventory for computer adaptive testing (Reise, 2012; Thomas, 1990; Weiss & Gibbons, 2007).This study further confirmed that when developing a multifaceted scale, it is essential to analyse the dimensionality of the scale in order to determine what the scale is actually measuring. The bi factor model can be employed in the development, exploration and confirmation of the dimensionality of the scale to examine the strength of the general factor relative to the multiple group factors of the scale.

T1  - The Effects of Item-by-Item Feedback during a Computer Adaptive Test
AN  - 1660170726
AB  - Decisions involved in designing high-stakes tests include whether to give examinees feedback and, if it is given, how to display the feedback to them. Researchers have yet to examine the effects of item response theory-related feedback on state test anxiety and examinees’ perceptions of fairness when said feedback is given on an item-by-item basis – such as during a computer adaptive test. To address these gaps in the literature, this experiment examined the effects of feedback on state test anxiety and perceived test fairness, accounting for individual differences in feedback acceptance, exam performance, and performance goal orientation. These effects were examined across three modes of item-by-item feedback (i.e., text feedback, graphical feedback, and text/graphical feedback together) during a computer adaptive test in an online sample (N = 338). A three-way interaction occurred between text and graphical feedback, test performance, and prove performance goal orientation. As expected, among those who received feedback, there was a significant, positive relationship between feedback acceptance and perceived test fairness. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Mutual Information Item Selection Method in Cognitive Diagnostic Computerized Adaptive Testing with Short Test Length
AN  - 1651841074; EJ1019117
AB  - Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) purports to combine the strengths of both CAT and cognitive diagnosis. Cognitive diagnosis models aim at classifying examinees into the correct mastery profile group so as to pinpoint the strengths and weakness of each examinee whereas CAT algorithms choose items to determine those strengths and weakness as efficiently as possible. Most of the existing CD-CAT item selection algorithms are evaluated when test length is relatively long whereas several applications of CD-CAT, such as in interim assessment, require an item selection algorithm that is able to accurately recover examinees' mastery profile with short test length. In this article, we introduce the mutual information item selection method in the context of CD-CAT and then provide a computationally easier formula to make the method more amenable in real time. Mutual information is then evaluated against common item selection methods, such as Kullback-Leibler information, posterior weighted Kullback-Leibler information, and Shannon entropy. Based on our simulations, mutual information consistently results in nearly the highest attribute and pattern recovery rate in more than half of the conditions. We conclude by discussing how the number of attributes, Q-matrix structure, correlations among the attributes, and item quality affect estimation accuracy.

T1  - Test Anxiety, Computer-Adaptive Testing and the Common Core
AN  - 1697499495; EJ1054865
AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

T1  - An Investigation on Computer-Adaptive Multistage Testing Panels for Multidimensional Assessment
AN  - 1826527360; ED565591
AB  - The computer-adaptive multistage testing (ca-MST) has been developed as an alternative to computerized adaptive testing (CAT), and been increasingly adopted in large-scale assessments. Current research and practice only focus on ca-MST panels for credentialing purposes. The ca-MST test mode, therefore, is designed to gauge a single scale. The present study is the first step to investigate ca-MST panels for diagnostic purposes, which involve the assessment of multiple attributes in the same test. This study employed computer simulation to compare multidimensional ca-MST panels and their unidimensional counterparts, and to explore the factors that affect the accuracy and efficiency of multidimensional ca-MST. Nine multidimensional ca-MST panel designs--which differed in configuration and test length--were simulated under varied attribute correlation scenarios. In addition, item pools with different qualities were studied to suggest appropriate item bank design. The comparison between the multidimensional ca-MST and a sequential of unidimensional ca-MST suggested that when attributes correlated moderate to high, employing a multidimensional ca-MST provided more accurate and efficient scoring decisions than several unidimensional ca-MST with IRT scoring. However, a multidimensional ca-MST did not perform better than its unidimensional counterpart with MIRT scoring. Nevertheless, multidimensional panels are still promising for diagnostic purposes given practical considerations. The investigation on multidimensional ca-MST design indicated the following: Higher attribute correlation was associated with better scoring decision because more information carried by a correlation matrix was available for estimation. This held true across all item pool conditions. An optimal item pool would be the one that was discriminative, appropriately located and specifically designed for a configuration. The accuracy and efficiency of a multidimensional ca-MST panel would be diminished if its item pool was too easy, or not informative. According to the results, the 1-2-3 configuration design was most promising. In terms of test length, an appropriate decision would largely depend on the attribute correlation and the item pool characteristics.

T1  - Using a computer-adaptive test simulation to investigate test coordinators' perceptions of a high-stakes computer-based testing program
AN  - 1609013939
AB  - This case study examined the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally-developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adaptive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and a classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators’ responses.    Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test coordinators preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test coordinators’ experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The findings of this study will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback be solicited from test coordinators prior to an operational test administration.

T1  - Identifying Differential Item Functioning in Multi-Stage Computer Adaptive Testing
AN  - 1347458951; EJ996865
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of CATSIB (Computer Adaptive Testing-Simultaneous Item Bias Test) for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) when items in the matching and studied subtest are administered adaptively in the context of a realistic multi-stage adaptive test (MST). MST was simulated using a 4-item module in a 7-panel administration. Three independent variables, expected to affect DIF detection rates, were manipulated: item difficulty, sample size, and balanced/unbalanced design. CATSIB met the acceptable criteria, meaning that the Type I error and power rates met 5% and 80%, respectively, for the large reference/moderate focal sample and the large reference/large focal sample conditions. These results indicate that CATSIB can be used to consistently and accurately detect DIF on an MST, but only with moderate to large samples. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)

T1  - Item selection methods in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing adopting polytomously-scored items under multidimensional generalized partial credit model
AN  - 1447013044
AB  - Four item selection methods are compared and investigated under three test formats in the context of Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing (MCAT) delivering polytomous items partially or completely in tests. Item selection methods examined include Fisher information based D-optimality (D-optimality), Kullback-Leibler information index (KI), mutual information (MI), and continuous entropy method (CEM). The three test formats considered are the POLYTYPE format that contains polytomous items with three response categories, the DPMIX format that delivers dichotomous items at the beginning and polytomous items at the final stage, and the PDMIX format that has the reverse order as DPMIX. In general, D-optimality shows the best estimation accuracy and conditional estimation accuracy. D-optimality, MI, and CEM are similar in terms of ability estimation accuracy and tendency in selecting items when the item bank size is large. For both dichotomous and polytomous items, KI is mostly outperformed by the other three methods in terms of ability estimation precision. When sub-thetas in both dimensions are equal, however, KI shows the best performance for polytomous items. In this study, which item type, dichotomous or polytomous, being administered first does not affect the estimation accuracy. However, if the test length is much longer or shorter than the test length of the current study, it is possible that the estimation accuracy could be affected by the order of delivering different item types. Both DPMIX and PDMIX formats yield similar conditional estimation accuracy pattern and precision. In addition, the item bank size does affect the estimation precision. These conclusions, however, might not be applied to MCAT testing with different test designs or item pool structures. More studies are needed in MCAT combining with polytomous items to further facilitate the development and improvement of the next-generation assessments such as formative assessment or testing for diagnosis.

T1  - Evaluating Knowledge Structure-Based Adaptive Testing Algorithms and System Development
AN  - 1312423561; EJ988452
AB  - In recent years, many computerized test systems have been developed for diagnosing students' learning profiles. Nevertheless, it remains a challenging issue to find an adaptive testing algorithm to both shorten testing time and precisely diagnose the knowledge status of students. In order to find a suitable algorithm, four adaptive testing algorithms, based on ordering theory, item relational structure theory, Diagnosys, and domain experts, were evaluated based on the training sample size, prediction accuracy, and the use of test items by the simulation study with paper-based test data. Based on the results of simulation study, ordering theory has the best performance. An ordering-theory-based knowledge-structure-adaptive testing system was developed and evaluated. The results of this system showed that the two different interfaces, paper-based and computer-based, did not affect the examinees' performance. In addition, the effect of correct guessing was discussed, and two methods with adaptive testing algorithms were proposed to mitigate this effect. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods improve the effect of correct guessing. (Contains 6 tables and 18 figures.)

T1  - On multistage adaptive biomarker-directed clinical trial design
AN  - 1287093791
AB  - Biomarker-directed targeted designs have been developed in recent years for pharmaceutical development for patient subpopulation with specific disease etiology. Multistage testing and adaption are desired for targeted designs to manage the risk of study population deviation, to conduct interim analysis and to make decisions on stochastic curtailment. We propose a multistage adaptive design for targeted trials that allows flexibility in multistage testing, stochastic curtailment decision-making, biomarker performance monitoring and biomarker performance-based sample size adaption.  The design is based on the theorem that the sequence of test statistics from multistage testings asymptotically satisfies Brownian motion in different targeted trial settings. The theorem is proven for both continuous and binary endpoints.      The simulation analysis has indicated that targeted multistage designs perform better than its untargeted counterpart in trial efficiency, effective information accumulation and stochastic curtailment decision-making by selecting targeted patients. However, this study has shown that biomarker performance influences heterogeneity of targeted study population and consequently affects planning and multistage testing of a targeted trial. The impact of biomarker performance has been extensively examined with regard to study efficiency, actual statistical power, type-I error, information accrument, and stochastic curtailment decision-making. To cope with the limited information of biomarker performance at study planning, we propose the biomarker performance-based sample size adaption for targeted trials for continuous and binary endpoints, respectively. The adaptive method can update actual biomarker performance at interim analysis and re-estimate sample size to achieve planned statistical power while preserving type-I error rate.  In summary, the multistage adaptive design improves targeted trials by providing great flexibility in multistage testing, early stopping, biomarker performance monitoring and biomarker performance-based sample size adaption.

T1  - Item selection methods in polytomous computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 901887117
AB  - Given the rapid advancement of computer technology, the importance of administering adaptive tests with polytomous items is in great need. With regard to the applicability of adaptive testing using polytomous IRT models, adaptive testing can use polytomous items of either rating scales, or in some testing situations of multiple choice. Additionally, the availability of computerized polytomous scoring of open-ended items enhances such applicability. This need promotes the research in polytomous adaptive testing (PAT). This dissertation is an effort to focus on item selection methods, as a major component, in polytomous computerized adaptive testing. So, it consists of five chapters that cover the following:    Chapter 1 focuses on a thorough introduction to the item response theory (IRT) models and adaptive testing related to polytomous items. Such an important overview and introduction to basic concepts in test theory and mathematical models for polytomous items is needed for the flow of consequent chapters. Chapter 2 is devoted to the development of a central location index (LI) to uniquely represent the polytomous item with a scale value parameter using most commonly used polytomous models. The motivation and rationale to search for a central or an overall location parameter is twofold: (a) the confusion of multiple and different parameterizations for a polytomous item even for the same model, and (b) the unavailability of such single location parameter block the usage of certain item selection methods in adaptive testing. Two approaches are used to derive the proposed LIs, one is based on the item category response functions (ICRFs) and the other is based on the polytomous item response function (IRF). As a result, four LIs are proposed. Chapter 3 is particularly assigned to development of an item selection method based on the developed location index and primarily assess its performance in the PAT context relative to existing methods. This method belongs to the non-information based item selection methods and we referred it as Matching-LI method. The results support that this proposed method is promising and is capable to produce accurate ability estimates and successfully manage the item pool usage. Chapter 4 introduces new item selection methods taking in consideration the previous chapter's results. The new methods are the hybrid, stage-based information, polytomous  a-stratification methods. The first two methods try to merge more than one criterion for selecting items of each PAT (e.g., the hybrid method merges both the Matching-LI and maximum information (MI) methods). The last method uses Matching-LI method within each stratum. Chapter 5 provides discussion, conclusions, and limitations and future research directions with respect to important components of an adaptive testing program (i.e., item selection methods, item response models, item banks, and trait versus attribute estimation).

T1  - Adaptive Item-Based Learning Environments Based on the Item Response Theory: Possibilities and Challenges
AN  - 1140133682; EJ978605
AB  - The popularity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is increasing rapidly. In order to make learning environments more efficient, researchers have been exploring the possibility of an automatic adaptation of the learning environment to the learner or the context. One of the possible adaptation techniques is adaptive item sequencing by matching the difficulty of the items to the learner's knowledge level. This is already accomplished to a certain extent in adaptive testing environments, where the test is tailored to the person's ability level by means of the item response theory (IRT). Even though IRT has been a prevalent computerized adaptive test (CAT) approach for decades and applying IRT in item-based ITSs could lead to similar advantages as in CAT (e.g. higher motivation and more efficient learning), research on the application of IRT in such learning environments is highly restricted or absent. The purpose of this paper was to explore the feasibility of applying IRT in adaptive item-based ITSs. Therefore, we discussed the two main challenges associated with IRT application in such learning environments: the challenge of the data set and the challenge of the algorithm. We concluded that applying IRT seems to be a viable solution for adaptive item selection in item-based ITSs provided that some modifications are implemented. Further research should shed more light on the adequacy of the proposed solutions. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

T1  - A Comparison of Anchor-Item Designs for the Concurrent Calibration of Large Banks of Likert-Type Items
AN  - 815957844; EJ900846
AB  - Current interest in measuring quality of life is generating interest in the construction of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) with Likert-type items. Calibration of an item bank for use in CAT requires collecting responses to a large number of candidate items. However, the number is usually too large to administer to each subject in the calibration sample. The concurrent anchor-item design solves this problem by splitting the items into separate subtests, with some common items across subtests; then administering each subtest to a different sample; and finally running estimation algorithms once on the aggregated data array, from which a substantial number of responses are then missing. Although the use of anchor-item designs is widespread, the consequences of several configuration decisions on the accuracy of parameter estimates have never been studied in the polytomous case. The present study addresses this question by simulation, comparing the outcomes of several alternatives on the configuration of the anchor-item design. The factors defining variants of the anchor-item design are (a) subtest size, (b) balance of common and unique items per subtest, (c) characteristics of the common items, and (d) criteria for the distribution of unique items across subtests. The results of this study indicate that maximizing accuracy in item parameter recovery requires subtests of the largest possible number of items and the smallest possible number of common items; the characteristics of the common items and the criterion for distribution of unique items do not affect accuracy.

T1  - Development and Evaluation of a Confidence-Weighting Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 762468077; EJ899874
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether the efficiency, precision, and validity of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) could be improved by assessing confidence differences in knowledge that examinees possessed. We proposed a novel polytomous CAT model called the confidence-weighting computerized adaptive testing (CWCAT), which combined a confidence-weighting scoring scheme with the graded response model (GRM). The CWCAT provided a more interactive testing environment by focusing on the examinees' confidence in their responses. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the comparison between the CWCAT and conventional CAT in terms of efficiency, precision, and validity. As expected, the polytomous method provided better discrimination among individual differences in the confidence in knowledge and required fewer items per examinee. Results also showed that CWCAT yielded ability estimates that were higher and better correlated to examinees' performance in English learning. Furthermore, the ability measured by CWCAT was not as likely to be affected by guessing as on conventional CAT, and, therefore, was more consistent with examinees' true ability.

T1  - Content clustering of a computerized-adaptive test
AN  - 822238427
AB  - School districts across the country are meeting the accountability challenges set forth by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) federal legislation, as well as challenges put forth at their state and local levels. Districts' accountability efforts have often brought them to contract with outside organizations offering standardized assessments for progress monitoring of students in intervention programs, and for on-going local assessments for program evaluation and planning. One such organization, Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), has developed several computer-based testing products to assist districts in their accountability and teaching/learning efforts. Their flagship product, Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), is a computerized-adaptive test (CAT), and is typically delivered on-line to districts.    Using Item Response Theory (IRT) selection algorithms, test questions are selected based on students' answers throughout the test experience. Students are presented with their first question (item) based on a predetermined value of their ability from previous testing and what is known about the item (Baker, 2001). Once they respond to the item, the software calibrates a temporary achievement level for that student, and selects their next question based on their estimated competency. Use of such powerful test assembly methods can enable a test to derive precise performance information about each student. Tests are assembled on demand, and results are immediately available to instructors and district personnel.    While precise information at a broader range of abilities is possible using such test assembly methods, item selection processes typically present items in a randomized order to maximize item bank usage, test security, and measurement properties. Little research has been done on item order with young test takers in the elementary grades, and the literature on item order with regard to computerized adaptive testing is silent. Of particular interest was whether a content-clustered version of a computerized adaptive test would result in stronger performance with young test takers, and whether the efficient testing processes already available via on-line testing could be improved. Data was reviewed in light of demographic sub-groups, including gender, ethnicity, and grade level.    The current study delivered both the standard version of a computerized adaptive test, MAP, along with a modified version, to a test population of 6589 students in a large southern U.S. school district of second, third, fourth and fifth graders. Using a double-blind selection process, half of the students received the standard MAP, and half received the modified version, which clustered items by goal strand across the five sub-tests of the assessment.    The study indicated that overall scores on MAP are not increased by content clustering, nor are there significant time gains on the overall test, for all students as a whole. However, results do indicate areas of significance with regard to ethnic sub-group differences. Overall test performance was stronger for African Americans on the modified version, while overall test duration was reduced for the three major ethnic sub-groups, particularly Hispanics. Boys improved their scores overall on the modified version, and gender differences on goal strands were present, which may indicate that certain goal strands scores increase under clustered conditions.

T1  - An Adaptive Testing System for Supporting Versatile Educational Assessment
AN  - 62002377; EJ819448
AB  - With the rapid growth of computer and mobile technology, it is a challenge to integrate computer based test (CBT) with mobile learning (m-learning) especially for formative assessment and self-assessment. In terms of self-assessment, computer adaptive test (CAT) is a proper way to enable students to evaluate themselves. In CAT, students are assessed through a process that uses item response theory (IRT), a well-founded psychometric theory. Furthermore, a large item bank is indispensable to a test, but when a CAT system has a large item bank, the test item selection of IRT becomes more tedious. Besides the large item bank, item exposure mechanism is also essential to a testing system. However, IRT all lack the above-mentioned points. These reasons have motivated the authors to carry out this study. This paper describes a design issue aimed at the development and implementation of an adaptive testing system. The system can support several assessment functions and different devices. Moreover, the researchers apply a novel approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO) to alleviate the computational complexity and resolve the problem of item exposure. Throughout the development of the system, a formative evaluation was embedded into an integral part of the design methodology that was used for improving the system. After the system was formally released onto the web, some questionnaires and experiments were conducted to evaluate the usability, precision, and efficiency of the system. The results of these evaluations indicated that the system provides an adaptive testing for different devices and supports versatile assessment functions. Moreover, the system can estimate students' ability reliably and validly and conduct an adaptive test efficiently. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the system was alleviated by the PSO approach. By the approach, the test item selection procedure becomes efficient and the average best fitness values are very close to the optimal solutions. (Contains 9 figures and 6 tables.)

T1  - Adjusting to Test Takers
AN  - 61989401; EJ819164
AB  - This article discusses the growing interest in computer-adaptive testing, which supporters say can help guide instruction, increase student motivation, and determine the best use of resources for districts. This method of testing shortens the test by not asking high-achieving students questions that are too easy for them, and likewise not giving struggling students questions that are too hard. However, computer-adaptive assessments are not the best way to evaluate students in every situation, experts point out. Though, they recognize the potential of computer-adaptive testing, experts also voice caution in using this kind of method.

T1  - Stability and sensitivity of a model-based person -fit index in detecting item pre -knowledge in computerized adaptive test
AN  - 304812844
AB  - Item response theory is a modern test theory. It focuses on the performance of each item. Under this framework, the performance of test takers on a test item can be predicted by a set of abilities. The relationship between the test takers' item performances and the set of abilities underlying item performances can be described by a monotonically increasing function called an item characteristic curve. Due to various personal reasons, the performances of the test takers may depart from the response patterns predicted by the underlying test model. In order to calculate the extent of departure of these aberrant response patterns, a number of methods have been developed under the theme "person-fit statistics". The degree of aberration is calculated as an index called person-fit index. Inside the computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test takers with different abilities will answer different numbers of questions and the difficulties of the items administered to them are usually clustered at the abilities of the test takers. Due to this reason, the application of person-fit indices in the computerized adaptive testing environment to measure misfit is difficult.    When the frequent accesses to the item bank has become feasible, test takers may memorize blocks of test items and share these items with future test takers. Individuals with prior knowledge of some items may use that information to get high scores, in the sense that their test scores have been artificially inflated. FLOR is an index of posterior log-odds ratio used for detecting the use of item pre-knowledge. It can be applied both in the fixed item, fixed length test and the CAT environment. It is a model-based index in which aberrant models are defined in the situation of item pre-knowledge. FLOR describes the likelihood that a response pattern arises from the aberrant models.    The present study used the hf plot to access the sensitivity of the person-fit indices. hf plot is a plot of hit rate against false alarm rate. For a higher hit rate, usually a higher false alarm rate is followed. hf plot provides a good tools for comparison between indices by inspection of the speed of rise of the curves. A sensitive index should give a faster rise of the curve. In this study, sensitivity of an index was defined as the speed of rise of the hf plot, which is represented by a parameter hfτ estimated from the data obtained from hf plot.    The present study assessed the stability of FLOR over other variables, which were unrelated to item pre-knowledge. It found that FLOR was stable over the discrimination and difficulty parameters of test items. It was also stable over positions of the exposed items in the test and the initial assignment of prior probability of item pre-knowledge. However, the asymptotes (guessing factor) and the probabilities of item exposure did affect the final values of FLOR seriously.    The present study also found that FLOR has a much superior sensitivity over other indices in detecting item pre-knowledge. Concerning about the sensitivity over different abilities of test takers, it was found that the sensitivity of FLOR was the highest among low ability test takers and the weakest among strong ability test takers in the fixed length and fixed items tests. However, the sensitivities of FLOR became the same among different abilities of test takers if items with difficulties matching their abilities were used in the tests. The number of beneficiaries among the test takers did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR. Moreover, in a simulation to test the differentiating power of FLOR, it was found that FLOR could differentiate item pre-knowledge from other reasons of personal misfits (test anxiety, player, random response and challenger) effectively.    After the stability and sensitivity of FLOR were investigated, the application of it in the CAT environment had become the main concern. The present studies found that both the test length and the number of exposed items affect the final value of FLOR. In the fixed length CAT, the FLOR has a much stronger sensitivity than lz and CUSUM in detecting item pre-knowledge. The sensitivity of FLOR in the fixed length CAT was the same as that in the fixed length fixed items test. If the test length could vary, the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT would be slightly weakened. The Adjusted FLOR index could increase the sensitivity. Concerning about the effect of ability on the sensitivity of FLOR in CAT, it was found that the abilities of the test takers in CAT did not affect the sensitivity of FLOR and Adjusted FLOR.

AN  - 275653844
AB  - This study focused on how early misfit affected the recovery of &thetas; for a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Number of misfitting items, generating &thetas;, item selection method, and &thetas; estimation method were independent variables in this study. It was found that CAT could recover from misfit-as-correct-responses for low ability simulees given a sufficient number of items. CAT could not recover from misfit-as-incorrect-responses for high ability simulees. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research were provided.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing for Polytomous Motivation Items: Administration Mode Effects and a Comparison with Short Forms
AN  - 62043948; EJ773650
AB  - In a randomized experiment (n = 515), a computerized and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) are compared. The item pool consists of 24 polytomous motivation items. Although items are carefully selected, calibration data show that Samejima's graded response model did not fit the data optimally. A simulation study is done to assess possible consequences of model misfit. CAT efficiency was studied by a systematic comparison of the CAT with two types of conventional fixed length short forms, which are created to be good CAT competitors. Results showed no essential administration mode effects. Efficiency analyses show that CAT outperformed the short forms in almost all aspects when results are aggregated along the latent trait scale. The real and the simulated data results are very similar, which indicate that the real data results are not affected by model misfit. (Contains 2 tables, 6 figures and 5 notes.)

T1  - Development of Web-based intelligent tutoring system for SDView
AN  - 304819955
AB  - SouthDakotaView (SDView) is a program funded by the United States Geological Survey that provides satellite remote sensing imagery for a variety of applications, including education; however, an educational tool that utilizes the SDView imagery has yet not been developed. In particular, there is presently no easy way for students to make use of the SDView satellite imagery in learning elementary geography. An image map viewer could be useful for K-12 students to understand the relationship between image data and geographic information. A web-based intelligent tutoring system has been used in many educational systems as an efficient way to deliver educational material. In an intelligent tutoring system, an adaptive testing scheme can be employed to accurately evaluate a student's knowledge level by utilizing a test.    Therefore, we focus on developing a web-based intelligent tutoring system for elementary geography students using an adaptive testing scheme. In this thesis, a prototype system, called SD-ITS, has been developed for a web-based geographic learning system. The prototype system is focused on applying an adaptive testing scheme and making an interactive image map for the intelligent tutoring system. This thesis demonstrates that the prototype system, SD-ITS, controls the student's test progress and has the ability to provide appropriate level of tutoring information from SDView or other archives for the students. This system adaptively adjusts the geography testing for each student on the basis of his/her knowledge level. In addition, an interactive image map application provides tutoring information that helps the students comprehend the real geographic information. In this thesis, the prototype system aims to motivate elementary students to learn more geography information through adaptive testing and an interactive geography maps for tutoring purpose.

T1  - An investigation of stratification exposure control procedures in CATs using the generalized partial credit model
AN  - 304782592
AB  - The a-stratification procedure of item exposure control was designed to stratify items by item discrimination to ensure that an adaptive test would administer items from the entire range of items, not just the most-informative ones. An improvement to the a-stratification method, the  a-stratification with b-blocking procedure added stratification according to item difficulty in order to take into account any correlation that might exist within the item pool between item discrimination and item difficulty. These procedures have been shown to work well using dichotomous items. This dissertation explored both stratification procedures using polytomous item pools to investigate whether or not an optimum number of strata could be implemented when administering polytomous computerized adaptive tests.    In addition to the stratification procedures, two other exposure control conditions were studied. The randomesque procedure was used in one condition while a no exposure control condition served as a baseline condition. Items calibrated according to the generalized partial credit model were used to construct two item pools. Since the items covered three areas of science, content balancing procedures were incorporated to ensure that each adaptive test provided the appropriate balance of content. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate ability levels from simulated CATs. The number of strata used with both stratification procedures ranged from two to five, to ensure enough items per stratum.    Along with descriptive statistics and correlations, bias and root mean squared error helped portray the accuracy of the simulated tests. Item exposure and item pool usage rates were used to show how much of the item pools were being used across administrations of the tests. Finally, item overlap rates were calculated to show how many of the same items were being used among simulated examinees of similar and different abilities.    The results of this study did not reveal an optimum number of strata for the stratification procedures with either item pool. Furthermore, the randomesque procedure outperformed the stratification procedures in terms of item exposure and item overlap rates for both item pools. This surprising result was not affected by the number of strata used within the stratification procedures.

T1  - Quantifying the effects of partial saturation on sand production prediction and geomechanical responses of reservoirs
AN  - 301690149
AB  - The initiation of wellbore failure and subsequent production of sand to the surface in petroleum reservoirs has often been associated with an increase in water cut.  Published field-level studies and experimental results do not provide a definite correlation between these two events - sand production and water breakthrough.  The experimental work described in this thesis aims to quantify the changes in the strength of weakly cemented and unconsolidated sand samples due to changes in fluid saturations.  This thesis addresses the reasons for the observed strength differences using unconsolidated and weakly cemented samples made of pure quartz, and different pore fluids (air, water and oil).
  Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) tests, Thick Wall Cylinder (TWC) strength tests and multistage tests were carried out at various saturation conditions.  A 3-D correlation between UCS, porosity and water saturation was recorded and the results were compared with theoretical predictions.  The initial failure and collapse strengths for partially saturated, unconsolidated TWC samples were approximately 7 and 37 times their UCS values of approximately 6 kPa.  The failure envelope for oil-saturated samples was weaker than water-saturated samples in multistage tests.  Suction controlled tests at avoids conditions did not show a systematic increase in shear strengths with increasing suction.
  The strength of weak and unconsolidated pure sand is shown to be not appreciably affected by changes in water saturation.  The loss of cementation and lubricating effect of pore fluids leads to reduced strength.  A common failure model based on suction alone is not recommended in predicting wellbore failure for all types of materials.

T1  - Reforming Federal Testing Policy to Support Teaching and Learning
AN  - 237003631
AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) assumes that state-mandated tests provide useful information to school administrators and teachers. However, interviews with administrators and teachers suggest that Minnesota's tests, which are representative of the current generation of state-mandated tests, fail to provide useful information to administrators and teachers about areas that need attention. The use of a single level of difficulty causes harmful stress and provides measurements of poor quality for many students. Computer-adaptive tests are a practical alternative, provide more useful information, reduce stress among students, and address four major concerns that teachers have about testing. This alternative could strengthen the link between testing and improved educational outcomes and improve the chances that NCLB will have a positive impact. However, current federal policy prohibits the use of computer-adaptive tests for accountability purposes. This article provides specific recommendations that potentially could address four critical concerns about current state-mandated tests. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Measurement of Korean EFL college students' foreign language classroom speaking anxiety: Evidence of psychometric properties and accuracy of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) with dichotomously scored items using a CAT simulation
AN  - 305382849
AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring.    Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety.    Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety.    Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

T1  - Constructing Rotating Item Pools for Constrained Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62079601; EJ739127
AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

T1  - Application of the rule space model in computerized adaptive testing for diagnostic assessment
AN  - 305249080
AB  - With the development and maturation of computer technology and test theories, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become more widely used in educational assessment. Most CATS systems are based on item response theory (IRT), and as compared with traditional paper and pencil tests (P & P test), CAT selects the most suitable items according to individual examinee's ability. Thus, it provides a more accurate and efficient estimate of examinees' ability.    Along with the development of the society and the rising education for the general public, there is stronger demand that educational tests should not only be used to rank and screen examinees, but also to provide diagnostic information about students' misconceptions. Researchers have proposed different models to establish these diagnostic tests, through which we can estimate examinees' knowledge ability or psychological traits from their item responses. Among these models, the Rule Space Model (RSM) is an influential one and has been implemented in the analysis and reporting of the PSAT (Preliminary SAT Test) for high school leavers in the United States of America.    Incorporating RSM into CAT will lead to a totally new testing system—the diagnostic computerized adaptive test. However, we have little knowledge on the characteristics of the model in its ability estimation efficiency, its new item selection strategy, and stopping rule, among other things. The present research aimed to understand these characteristics.    Broadly differentiated, there were two main research purposes. Firstly, the research aimed to understand in greater depth the properties of the RSM, including, such as, how estimation accuracy would be affected by different factors (e.g. test length). Secondly, in the incorporation of RSM in diagnostic computerized adaptive tests, the performances of four different item selection methods were compared. These two purposes were achieved through two related sets of studies. The first set of experiments consisted of seven simulation experiments to investigate factors affecting the performance of the RSM. These factors being examined include: test length, number of attributes in the test, hierarchical relations among attributes, nature (simple versus complicated) of items used, item guessing or slipness parameter, and item response model (one- versus three-parameter model) used in item bank. The second set of experiments compared four item selection strategies in diagnostic CAT, with random selection method as borderline method. In order to calculate and compare the accuracy of examinees' attribute estimation, the Monte Carlo simulation method was used in both sets of studies. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

In this paper, a test assembly model for the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools is presented. The model was motivated by Gullicksen's (1950) matched random subtests method. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

T1  - The effect of *test characteristics on aberrant response patterns in computer adaptive testing
AN  - 304699823
AB  - The advantages that computer adaptive testing offers over linear tests have been well documented. The Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) design is more efficient than the Linear test design as fewer items are needed to estimate an examinee's proficiency to a desired level of precision. In the ideal situation, a CAT will result in examinees answering different number of items according to the stopping rule employed. Unfortunately, the realities of testing conditions have necessitated the imposition of time and minimum test length limits on CATs. Such constraints might place a burden on the CAT test taker resulting in aberrant response behaviors by some examinees. Occurrence of such response patterns results in inaccurate estimation of examinee proficiency levels. This study examined the effects of test lengths, time limits and the interaction of these factors with the examinee proficiency levels on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns.    The focus of the study was on the aberrant behaviors caused by rushed guessing due to restrictive time limits. Four different testing scenarios were examined; fixed length performance tests with and without content constraints, fixed length mastery tests and variable length mastery tests without content constraints. For each of these testing scenarios, the effect of two test lengths, five different timing conditions and the interaction between these factors with three ability levels on ability estimation were examined. For fixed and variable length mastery tests, decision accuracy was also looked at in addition to the estimation accuracy. Several indices were used to evaluate the estimation and decision accuracy for different testing conditions.    The results showed that changing time limits had a significant impact on the occurrence of aberrant response patterns conditional on ability. Increasing test length had negligible if not negative effect on ability estimation when rushed guessing occured. In case of performance testing high ability examinees while in classification testing middle ability examinees suffered the most. The decision accuracy was considerably affected in case of variable length classification tests.

T1  - Performance of Item Exposure Control Methods in Computerized Adaptive Testing: Further Explorations
AN  - 62436218; ED442837
AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of the Sympson and Hetter conditional procedure (SHC), a modification of the Sympson and Hetter (1985) algorithm, in controlling the exposure rates of items in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment. The properties of the procedure were compared with those of the Davey and Parshall (1995) and the Stocking and Lewis (1995) (SLC) conditional multinomial procedures within the purview of estimating examinee's abilities. Each of the exposure control methods was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed based on the CAT design established for this study. The advantages and disadvantages of these strategies were considered under four item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of test security, test overlap rates, utilization of the item pool, and conditional standard errors of measurement. Also, the issue of the appropriate conditional sample sizes in deriving the exposure control parameters was considered in the present study. Simulation results show no effect of using the four conditional sample sizes. The SHC produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates followed by the SLC method. Results also show that as long as the control for item exposure was not exercised, optimal items could be administered to almost every examinee under any of the four item pools. Findings of this study provide useful insights on how item pool sizes and maximum item exposure rates affect the performance of the exposure control methods.

T1  - Multidimensional adaptive testing using the weighted likelihood estimation
AN  - 304637371
AB  - This study extended Warm's (1989) weighted likelihood estimation (WLE) to a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT) setting. WLE was compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), expected a posteriori (EAP), and maximum a posteriori (MAP) using a three-dimensional 3PL IRT model under a variety of computerized adaptive testing conditions. The dependent variables included bias, standard error of ability estimates (SE), square root of mean square error (RMSE), and test information. The independent variables were ability estimation methods, intercorrelation levels between dimensions, multidimensional structures, and ability combinations. Simulation results were presented in terms of descriptive statistics, such as figures and tables. In addition, inferential procedures were used to analyze bias by conceptualizing this Monte Carlo study as a statistical sampling experiment.    The results of this study indicate that WLE and the other three estimation methods yield significantly more accurate ability estimates under an approximate simple test structure with one dominant dimension and several secondary dimensions. All four estimation methods, especially WLE, yield very large SEs when a three equally dominant multidimensional structure was employed. Consistent with previous findings based on unidimensional IRT model, MLE and WLE are less biased in the extreme of the ability scale; MLE and WLE yield larger SEs than the Bayesian methods; test information-based SEs underestimate actual SEs for both MLE and WLE in MCAT situations, especially at shorter test lengths; WLE reduced the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure; test information-based SEs underestimates the actual SEs of MLE and WLE estimators in the MCAT conditions, similar to the findings of Warm (1989) in the unidimensional case.    The results from the MCAT simulations did show some advantages of WLE in reducing the bias of MLE under the approximate simple structure with a fixed test length of 50 items, which was consistent with the previous research findings based on different unidimensional models. It is clear from the current results that all four methods perform very poorly when the multidimensional structures with multiple dominant factors were employed. More research efforts are urged to investigate systematically how different multidimensional structures affect the accuracy and reliability of ability estimation. Based on the simulated results in this study, there is no significant effect found on the ability estimation from the intercorrelation between dimensions.

T1  - Comparing Restricted and Unrestricted Self-Adapted Testing as Alternatives to Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62449718; ED423258
AB  - Previous studies have shown that, when administered a self-adapted test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a self-adapted test--lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT)--can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted self-adapted test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only in the region of their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class. The results show that while the RS-AT effectively controlled the standard errors of proficiency estimation, examinees receiving an RS-AT did not show higher mean proficiency or lower posttest state anxiety than examinees receiving a CAT.

T1  - Item banking and test development. Psychometric matters and requirement analysis of a computerised system
AN  - 304465366
AB  - This dissertation is concerned with item banks, more specifically, with the construction of them. Item banks are an essential piece in adaptive strategies of testing, as they are the item source for this kind of tests, the place from where the item(s) to be administered at each moment are selected. However, item bank development appears as a complex task that could be the reason of a reduced number of available item banks and, consequently, a limited application of adaptive tests in practice.    These precedents have motivated the main goal of this dissertation: the development of a tool, that taking profit of computing power, supports the process of development and management of item banks. With it, it has been tried to do the development of item banks more efficient and, consequently, more accessible the renowned computerized adaptive tests.    The main contribution of this work to satisfy this goal has come through the in-depth review of the whole process of building an item bank and the analysis of requirements of a program oriented to give support to the item bank development process. This program is referred in the thesis as BANKIT.    With the former review emerged the meaning and implications of the different tasks involved in the building of item banks as well as the relationship between them, which has allowed to make clear what should be satisfied with BANKIT and set up the basis for the latter analysis. Available software, needs, tasks, attributes, data and functional analysis have made up the requirement analysis of this computerized system.

T1  - The effect of individual differences variables on the assessment of ability for computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 304278059
AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) continues to gain momentum as the accepted testing modality for a growing number of certification, licensure, education, government and human resource applications. However, the developers of these tests have for the most part failed to adequately explore the impact of individual differences such as test anxiety on the adaptive testing process. It is widely accepted that non-cognitive individual differences variables interact with the assessment of ability when using written examinations. Logic would dictate that individual differences variables would equally affect CAT. Two studies were used to explore this premise. In the first study, 507 examinees were given a test anxiety survey prior to taking a high stakes certification exam using CAT or using a written format. All examinees had already completed their course of study, and the examination would be their last hurdle prior to being awarded certification. High test anxious examinees performed worse than their low anxious counterparts on both testing formats. The second study replicated the finding that anxiety depresses performance in CAT. It also addressed the differential effect of anxiety on within test performance. Examinees were candidates taking their final certification examination following a four year college program. Ability measures were calculated for each successive part of the test for 923 subjects. Within subject performance varied depending upon test position. High anxious examinees performed poorly at all points in the test, while low and medium anxious examinee performance peaked in the middle of the test. If test anxiety and performance measures were actually the same trait, then low anxious individuals should have performed equally well throughout the test. The observed interaction of test anxiety and time on task serves as strong evidence that test anxiety has motivationally mediated as well as cognitively mediated effects. The results of the studies are discussed relative to the need for CAT developers to consider individual differences variables such as test anxiety when constructing their tests.

T1  - Developing Computerized Tests for Classroom Teachers: A Pilot Study
AN  - 62673665; ED391471
AB  - Two types of computerized testing have been defined: (1) computer-based testing, using a computer to administer conventional tests in which all examinees take the same set of items; and (2) adaptive tests, in which items are selected for administration by the computer, based on examinee's previous responses. This paper discusses an option for classroom teachers that is easier to develop than a computerized adaptive test, but more secure and sophisticated than a computer-based test. The process of developing and pilot testing the computer-administered test and the results of a survey of student reactions are described. Subjects for the study consisted of 108 undergraduates taking summer educational technology courses in computer applications at a Southern university. Identical items were used for paper-and-pencil and computerized tests. No significant differences were found for either administration. Student responses indicated that: all of the students had familiarity with computers; 94% had no problems understanding the test directions; 53% initially experienced anxiety about taking the test on a computer; 89% indicated that the computer test was as fair as a paper test; and 61% indicated a preference for the computer test, while 19% indicated that both methods worked equally well. Four tables depict results for computerized tests versus paper-and-pencil tests; descriptive data for both kinds of tests; students' yes/no responses to the attitude survey; and examinee's comments regarding computerized testing.

AN  - 62656885; ED392839
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Korean college students (n=208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (motivated and non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) under the counterbalanced design at the computer laboratory. They were also given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale, a 10-item computer test anxiety scale, and a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing. A multivariate analysis of covariance, with the math aptitude and the test anxiety as covariates, demonstrated that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes.

T1  - Content validity of a computerized adaptive licensing and certification examination: A comparison of content-balancing methods
AN  - 304232692
AB  - The benefits of adaptive testing, reduced test length and increased measurement precision, are in part achieved through the application of a maximum-information item selection algorithm. While such an algorithm is an effective means for tailoring the difficulty of adaptive tests to examinee ability, its use with multidimensional content domains might result in examinations that lack content validity.    Licensure and certification examinations typically assess knowledge of multidimensional content domains. As such, balancing test content is an important consideration for these types of tests.    This study investigated the effects of content balancing on an adaptive licensure and certification examination. A computer simulation was used with data distributions attained from previous administrations of a conventional test.    The performance of the adaptive test was examined under four content-balancing methods and fifteen stopping rules. The results showed that employing a rigorous content-balancing method had no significant adverse effect on the efficiency or accuracy of the adaptive test under study. Findings, also indicated that ability estimation bias contributed to slight inaccuracies in the determination of the passing status for examinees whose abilities were near the minimum passing ability.    The findings of this study support the use of adaptive testing for licensure and certification examinations under the following conditions: rigorous content balancing is employed, the item bank contains a sufficient number of items to optimally measure a range of abilities, and if estimation bias is found to affect the pass/fail decision, it is corrected. Implications of these findings are discussed for school certification testing.

T1  - The effects of computerized adaptive testing and examinee test motivation on algebra skills, test anxiety, and attitudes
AN  - 304160034
AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance.    Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables.    This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance.    The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

T1  - Comparing Computerized Adaptive and Self-Adapted Tests: The Influence of Examinee Achievement Locus of Control
AN  - 62798906; ED371007
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between examinee achievement-specific locus of control and the differences between self-adapted testing (SAT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in terms of mean estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. Subjects were 379 college students. A disordinal interaction was found between test type and locus of control. Examinees with an internal locus of control were affected positively by the SAT (relative to the CAT). For examinees with an external locus of control, however, the SAT appeared to have a negative effect on both estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. There are four tables and two figures.

T1  - Computer-based selection tests: psychological and measurement implications of adaptive testing.
AN  - 900237843
AB  - The aim of this thesis is to develop realistic expectations about the psychological and psychometric implications of using computerized adaptive tests (CAT).  A review is carried out of literature on computerized-based testing (CBT) and CAT.  A field study as well as four laboratory experiments were conducted to achieve that goal.  The current research strongly suggested the equivalence between the P& P and CAT formats for the Abstract Reasoning (AR) and Mechanical Reasoning (MR) tests of the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), but failed to do so for the Numerical Ability (NA) test.  Also, the CAT version of DAT can predict a performance variable as accurately as can the P& P format.  Overall, testees' attitudes toward several aspects of computerized testing were positive.    The results confirmed the negative relationship between computer experience and computer anxiety.  Moreover, knowledge of CAT behaviour negatively affected subjects' performance, but did not increase the level of their state anxiety.  This suggested that a form of feedback acts during the adaptive test which has a negative effect on testees' performance and response time.  This assumption was confirmed.  Subjects spend a shorter time on the subsequent item after negative feedback (wrong) on the previous item than after positive feedback (right).  It has been found that although the response time for answering an individual item was higher for CAT format than for P& P format, the CAT version of DAT resulted in a 20% reduction in completion time of the test.  Also, the difficulty level of the initial items has a significant effect on testees' overall scores.    The findings of this thesis suggest that CAT has numerous advantages and potential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of testing, and has potential areas of future contribution within personnel selection and assessment.  This potential can be realized if proper consideration is made in designing, developing, and implementing these testing systems, and if professional standards are maintained by developers and users.

T1  - The Relationship between Examinee Anxiety and Preference for Self-Adapted Testing
AN  - 62817395; EJ484374
AB  - The hypothesis that previously found effects of self-adapted testing (SAT) are attributable to examinees' having an increased perception of control over a stressful testing situation was studied with 377 college students who took computerized adaptive tests or SAT. The strongest preference for SAT was seen in individuals with the highest mathematics anxiety. (SLD)

T1  - Student and teacher attitudes concerning computer-adaptive testing methods in a middle school setting
AN  - 304096676
AB  - This study was designed to help educators evaluate the desirability of computer adaptive testing compared to nonadaptive paper/pencil testing for middle school students and teachers. Computer adaptive testing uses computers for test administration, selection of items, scoring, and reporting. The study examined three aspects of computer adaptive testing: (1) student attitudes concerning computer testing; (2) student factors (e.g., gender) affecting student attitudes; and (3) teacher perceptions about its strengths and weaknesses.    The study examined the relationships between student factors (gender, race/ethnicity, math ability level, math test performance, grade, and computer usage) and student attitudes concerning computer adaptive testing. Three aspects of student attitudes were examined: ease with the method, comfort with equipment, and preference for computer adaptive testing.    The sample consisted of 343 students and 6 teachers from one middle school in a mid-Atlantic school district. The students took two versions of a functional mathematics test--paper/pencil and computer adaptive--and a 14 item survey assessing their attitudes about the test. The teachers participated in a survey and interview.    The results of the study indicate that a majority of the students and teachers support computer adaptive testing. With regards to students, a majority reported positive reactions in areas such as preference for computer testing as opposed to paper/pencil testing, clarity of directions and graphics, and ease of reading from the screen. However, a majority of students also reported that they were bothered by their inability to review and change answers. In addition, accelerated and remedial ability level students were more concerned with some aspects of computer adaptive testing than average ability level students. Differential results for the factors of gender and math achievement were also found.    With regards to teachers, positive comments focused on the shorter time needed for testing, convenience of using computer technology for testing, and immediate scoring information.    Although the study shows strong student and teacher support for the use of this new testing methodology, several important issues should be addressed especially for remedial and accelerated ability level students.

T1  - Individual Differences in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62803573; ED365713
AB  - Research on the major computerized adaptive testing (CAT) strategies is reviewed, and some findings are reported that examine effects of examinee demographic and psychological characteristics on CAT strategies. In fixed branching strategies, all examinees respond to a common routing test, the score of which is used to assign examinees to a second-stage test. The currently popular statistically branched adaptive strategies are based on item-response theory, and include maximum likelihood strategy and Bayesian strategy. Two alternative strategies are the use of self-adapted testing and testlet strategies. Examinee characteristic variables are divided into: (1) demographic variables; (2) computer-use variables; (3) test-taking strategy variables; (4) cognitive characteristics; and (5) affective characteristics. Although research on the relationship between examinee psychological characteristics and CAT has been inconclusive, the basic findings are that examinees of different ethnic, gender, age, grade, ability, academic self-concept, test anxiety, computer anxiety, math anxiety, and computer experience groups are differentially affected by the adaptive testing strategies. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (Contains 67 references.) (SLD)

T1  - An Investigation of Restricted Self-Adapted Testing
AN  - 62872992; ED358153
AB  - A new testing strategy that provides protection against the problem of having examinees in adaptive testing choose difficulty levels that are not matched to their proficiency levels was introduced and evaluated. The method, termed restricted self-adapted testing (RSAT), still provides examinees with a degree of control over the difficulty levels of their test items. The range of item choice is restricted to a region around the examinee's current proficiency estimate. Participants in this study were 186 students in grades 3 through 8 in the Portland (Oregon) Public School system during the winter of 1992-93, who were tested as part of an ongoing computerized adaptive testing program. Students were randomly assigned to a computerized adaptive test (CAT), a self-adaptive test (SADT), or RSAT in mathematics. Results indicate no differences between CAT and SADT conditions in terms of mean proficiency and mean posttest state anxiety. The basic RSAT method appears to hold promise for providing examinees with control over the testing situation, while preventing large mismatches between item difficulty choice and proficiency level. The RSAT procedure should be evaluated empirically. (SLD)

T1  - The Role of Anxiety in Examinee Preference for Self-Adapted Testing
AN  - 62867202; ED358154
AB  - This study assessed whether providing examinees with a choice between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and self-adaptive testing (SAT) affects test performance in comparison with being assigned a CAT or SAT, and evaluated variables influencing examinee choice of either test form. The relative influences of test type and test choice on examinee anxiety were also examined. Subjects were 244 undergraduate and 133 graduate students from a large midwestern university. Students were randomly assigned to SAT, CAT, and choice conditions for an algebra test. Test-related anxiety was assessed with a paper-and-pencil measure in pretests and posttests. It was found that, for students with high mathematics anxiety, providing a choice between CAT and SAT led to significantly higher mean proficiency estimates, lending support to the hypothesis that examinees can cope with a stressful situation more effectively if they feel that they have some control over the source of the stress. Expected differences in estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety between CAT and SAT conditions were not found, but a strong relationship was seen between examinee test type choice and mathematics anxiety level. Higher anxiety examinees have a greater preference for the control provided by SAT. Six tables and two graphs summarize findings. (SLD)

T1  - A comparison of computerized adaptive and paper-and-pencil tests on reliability and susceptibility to testwiseness
AN  - 304079877
AB  - Advances in the application of item response theory and the availability of powerful microcomputers have made computerized adaptive testing (CAT) a reality. Two issues that need to be considered before large-scale applications of computerized adaptive tests are (1) reliability of CAT scores, and (2) their susceptibility to factors that contaminate test scores.    Testwiseness has been shown to have a significant effect on P&P scores. The effects of TW on CAT scores have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of TW on CAT and P&P tests. Reliability of a CAT and a P&P version of a test was also compared.    Subjects were 120 students at a large university. Half received TW training as part of their course content; half received no TW training. Subjects were randomly assigned to take a CAT or a P&P math test. They were tested again on the same test after three weeks. They also responded to a questionnaire about their attitudes toward the test and TW strategies they had used. It was hypothesized that TW training would be more effective in improving P&P test scores than CAT scores.    Contrary to expectations, results showed no significant effects for TW training. There is evidence to suggest that the group without TW training may have been more testwise than the TW training group initially. Mode effects were significant for test scores (higher on P&P than on CAT) and for attitudes toward the test (more positive toward CAT).    Correlation between the two sets of CAT scores was low (.29). Test-retest reliability was high (.81) for the P&P test. The low reliability of CAT in this study may be attributed to the inappropriateness of the difficulty level of the test for the subjects, inconsistencies in subjects' responses due to lack of motivation, and termination of the test at ability estimates greater than 4 or smaller than $-$4. It is suggested that with increased usage of CATs, new test-taking strategies may emerge that are only relevant to the CAT.

T1  - Optimal test designs with content balancing and variable target information functions as constraints
AN  - 304058330
AB  - Optimal test design involves the application of an item selection heuristic to construct a test to fit the target information function in order that the standard error of the test can be controlled at different regions of the ability continuum. The real data simulation study assessed the efficiency of binary programming in optimal item selection by comparing the degree in which the obtained test information was approximated to different target information functions with a manual heuristic. The effects of imposing a content balancing constraint was studied in conventional, two-stage and adaptive tests designed using the automated procedure.    Results showed that the automated procedure improved upon the manual procedure significantly when a uniform target information function was used. However, when a peaked target information function was used, the improvement over the manual procedure was marginal. Both procedures were affected by the distribution of the item parameters in the item pool.    The degree in which the examinee empirical scores were recovered was lower when a content balancing constraint was imposed in the conventional test designs. The effect of uneven item parameter distribution in the item pool was shown by the poorer recovery of the empirical scores at the higher regions of the ability continuum. Two-stage tests were shown to limit the effects of content balancing. Content balanced adaptive tests using optimal item selection was shown to be efficient in empirical score recovery, especially in maintaining equiprecision in measurement over a wide ability range despite the imposition of content balancing constraint in the test design.    The study had implications for implementing automated test designs in the school systems supported by hardware and expertise in measurement theory and addresses the issue of content balancing using optimal test designs within an adaptive testing framework.

T1  - Effects of computerized adaptive test anxiety on nursing licensure examination
AN  - 304041739
AB  - Purpose of study. This study was to determine if nursing candidates for licensure experienced an increase in anxiety due to the administration of an examination by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second purpose was to discover if certain groups were "at risk" of experiencing computer test anxiety.    Method. This study was a two-group, experimental design conducted concurrently with the CAT-NCLEX simulation. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing selected practical nursing graduates and repeat examinees to participate in a field test of the Computerized Adaptive Testing of the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The experimental group for this study participated in the CAT simulation activity prior to taking NCLEX-PN and the control group did so after NCLEX-PN.    Both groups completed a 17 item Self-Report Anxiety Questionnaire. The responses were summed; the total score was considered to be a measure of anxiety.    Findings. Analysis of the data indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in computer test anxiety between the two groups. This is not to infer that there was no computer test anxiety expressed but rather that there was virtually no difference in the level of anxiety reported by the experimental group and the control group.    Further analysis of data indicated that persons with previous computer experience reported higher levels of computer test anxiety than those without previous computer experience and that females reported themselves as experiencing higher levels of computer test anxiety than did males. The results did not indicate that minorities experienced higher levels of computer test anxiety than non-minority groups. Lastly, there was no correlation between nursing grade point average or age and levels of computer test anxiety.    Conclusion. Participation in a computerized testing simulation did not affect the level of computer test anxiety. The only groups to experience higher levels of computer test anxiety are females and those with previous computer experience.

T1  - Test Anxiety and Test Performance Under Computerized Adaptive Testing Methods
AN  - 62934912; ED344910
AB  - Little research exists on the psychological impacts of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and how it may affect test performance. Three CAT procedures were examined, in which items were selected to match students' achievement levels, from the item pool at random, or according to student choice of item difficulty levels. Twenty-four graduate students (5 males and 19 females) at Indiana University (Richmond) were randomly assigned to one of six testing orders formed by the three mastery test approaches and by blocking on native and non-native speakers. While at a computer, students received a description of adaptive testing methods and then a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. Right after completing each test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale, ranked their preferences among tests, and evaluated their performance on each of the tests. No statistically significant mean differences were found among mean student achievement scores or among in-test anxiety means under the three adaptive testing methods. Students reporting higher anxiety scored significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Those preferring the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most were less anxious during those tests. Instead of actual performance, students' perceptions of how well they did were significantly correlated with preference rankings for the tests. The matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach decisions than did the random-selection tests. Ten tables, 1 figure, and a 19-item list of references are included.

T1  - A Study of Black At-Risk Urban Youth Using Computer Assisted Testing
AN  - 62942037; ED348024
AB  - The objectives of this study were to develop, implement, and evaluate the year long project, Microcomputer Adaptive Testing High-Risk Urban Students (MATH-R-US). The project produced diagnostic software to meet the following criteria: (1) help students obtain high school mathematics credit needed for graduation; (2) motivate students to learn mathematics; (3) account for erratic student attendance; and (4) use computer adaptive testing as an integral part of the program. The project was used for an entire school year by a class in an urban high school with an at-risk predominantly black population and a high rate of absenteeism. The tests, which accept generative responses rather than multiple choice answers, were administered once a week in the school's computer lab. The results of each test were saved and practice sheets, with answer keys, were generated for the missed objectives. The program was evaluated to improve implementation and furnish descriptive data to the classroom teachers and school administrators. It was found that the program generated intense student competition to see who could get the most hamburger graphics--which appeared on the screen when students completed a test with 100% accuracy--in an hour. Both males and female students expressed positive attitudes about the course components, but female responses reflected more confidence in their own abilities. Computer math test scores indicated a consistent improvement on retesting of a topic, with 23 perfect scores on 43 retests. A discussion of the implications of this study concludes the paper.

T1  - Correlates of Examinee Item Choice Behavior in Self-Adapted Testing
AN  - 63001252; ED331889
AB  - The strategies examinees employ when making item difficulty level choices in self-adapted computerized testing were investigated. Subjects were 148 college students (88 females and 60 males) in an introductory statistics course. The primary instrument was a self-adapted computerized algebra test used to measure student readiness for the statistics course. Each examinee was administered 20 items from a pool of 93. Students rated their self-efficacy before the test and were administered measures of mathematics anxiety and test anxiety. Inspection of each student's data file provided an indicator of selection strategy. Examinees who chose a more difficult first test item expressed greater capability and higher confidence, reported less anxiety just prior to testing, and less anxiety about mathematics in general. When selecting additional items, examinees tended toward what was termed a sluggishly flexible strategy; they chose more difficult items after passing an item or string of items, and chose less difficult items after failing a single item or string of items. The most frequent choice was to remain at the same level. Results indicate that self-adaptive testing may be a viable alternative to computerized adaptive testing. Two figures and two tables contain data from the study. (SLD)

T1  - Equivalence of Rasch Item Calibrations and Ability Estimates across Modes of Administration
AN  - 62571708; ED400281
AB  - The equivalence of pencil and paper Rasch item calibrations when used in a computer adaptive test administration was explored in this study. Items (n=726) were precalibarted with the pencil and paper test administrations. A computer adaptive test was administered to 321 medical technology students using the pencil and paper precalibrations in the item selection algorithms and in the computation of examinee ability estimates. The response data from the computer adaptive test administration were analyzed yielding recalibrated item difficulties and examinee ability estimates. Item precalibrations were compared with item recalibrations. Examinee ability estimates obtained using the item precalibrations on the computer adaptive administration were compared with the examinee ability estimates obtained from using the item recalibrations on the computer adaptive administration. The correlation for examinee ability estimates was 0.99 and for item correlations it was 0.90. Some item calibrations shifted but most remained consistent within the limits of error. Item shift, however, did not affect the ordering of examinee ability estimates. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 23 references.) (Author/SLD)

T1  - Individual Differences in Computer Adaptive Testing: Anxiety, Computer Literacy and Satisfaction
AN  - 62563471; ED400285
AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

T1  - Test anxiety and test performance under computerized adaptive testing methods
AN  - 303923651
AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection).    Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited.    No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.

T1  - Application of an IRT-based response aberrancy statistic to personality trait measurement
AN  - 303860707
AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore psychometric issues pertinent to application of an IRT-based response aberrancy detection statistic in the domain of personality measurement. Monte Carlo and real-data analyses were conducted to address several issues regarding the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ response aberrancy statistic. The major issues explored were characteristics of the null distribution of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic, and its power to identify aberrant response patterns. In addition, the consistency of examinee Z$\sb{\rm L}$ level across half-tests, and the recovery of Z$\sb{\rm L}$ at different adaptive test lengths was examined. There were four main results. First, the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ index null distribution was not well standaradized when item parameters of personality scales were used; the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ null distribution variance was significantly less than the hypothesized value of 1.0 under several conditions. Second, the power of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic to detect response aberrancy was affected by the scoring method. It appeared that detection power was optimal when a biweight estimator of $\theta$ was used. Third, examinee Z$\sb{\rm L}$ level was not consistent across half-tests. This result implied that response aberrancy is not a reliable person characteristic within a particular trait domain. Finally, identifying aberrant response patterns in an adaptive testing context was problematic. A major problem was that the null distribution of the Z$\sb{\rm L}$ statistic was not consistent across adaptive test lengths. In the discussion, several recommendations are made regarding proper implementation of response aberrancy statistics in personality measurement.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Comparison of the Nominal Response Model and the Three Parameter Logistic Model
AN  - 63257550; ED281872
AB  - A nominal response model-based computerized adaptive testing procedure (nominal CAT) was implemented using simulated data. Ability estimates from the nominal CAT were compared to those from a CAT based upon the three-parameter logistic model (3PL CAT). Furthermore, estimates from both CAT procedures were compared with the known true abilities used to generate the simulated data. Results showed that the nominal CAT's ability estimates were highly correlated with those of the 3PL CAT as well as with the true abilities. Furthermore, the nominal CAT had a significantly higher association with negative true thetas than did the 3PL CAT, and it also had significantly lower standard errors of estimate than did the 3PL CAT. However, the nominal model-based CAT had difficulty estimating positive thetas and had a poor convergence rate. In contrast, the 3PL CAT had a high convergence rate and its performance was not affected by whether the true abilities were positive or negative. Potential reasons for the nominal CAT's high nonconvergence rate as well as implications for computerized adaptive testing were discussed. (Author)

T1  - COMPUTERIZED ADAPTIVE TESTING: A COMPARISON OF THE NOMINAL RESPONSE MODEL AND THE THREE PARAMETER MODEL
AN  - 303612757
AB  - Item Response Theory (IRT) is a relatively recent development in psychometrics that has emerged as an attractive alternative to classical test theory. This is primarily a result of IRT's potential for solving many long standing measurement problems. One important and very promising application of IRT is Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). CAT is a procedure for administering tests which are individually tailored for each examinee. A CAT system uses a particular IRT model in combination with test item characteristics to estimate the examinee's ability.    To date, all implementations of CATs have been built on models which require dichotomous scoring of test items. For the purpose of ability estimation these systems do not differentiate between an examinee's incorrect answer and other incorrect alternatives.    In contrast to the IRT models presently used in CAT implementations, the Nominal Response Model utilizes the information in the pattern of wrong responses for ability estimation. No assumptions are made about a particular response being more correct than another.    A Nominal Response Model-based CAT (nominal CAT) was implemented using real and simulated data. Comparisons were made between the nominal CAT's ability estimates and those of a CAT based upon the three-parameter logistic model (3PL CAT). In addition, estimates from the nominal CAT were compared with the known true ability estimates used to generate the simulated data. Results showed that the nominal CAT's ability estimates were highly correlated with those of the 3PL CAT as well as with the true abilities. Furthermore, the nominal CAT had a significantly higher association with the negative true abilities than did the 3PL CAT and it also had significantly lower standard errors of estimate than did the 3PL CAT. However, the nominal CAT had difficulty estimating positive abilities and had a poor convergence rate. In contrast, the 3PL CAT has a high convergence rate and its performance was not affected by whether the true abilities were positive or negative. Implications for computerized adaptive testing were discussed.

T1  - An adaptive test of musical memory: An application of item response theory to the assessment of musical ability
AN  - 303589997
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an item response theory-based adaptive test of musical ability designed to overcome common shortcomings of commercially available musical ability tests. These shortcomings include test inefficiency, poor reliability and validity, ceiling effects, and examinee fatigue and boredom. Because of its suitability for item response theory-based techniques and its history in the music test field, tonal memory was chosen as the specific musical skill to be assessed.    The research was conducted in three phases. The goal of the first phase was to develop item-prototypes for the adaptive test pool by determining combinations of instrumental timbre, rhythmic complexity, and tonality that provide unidimensional, unbiased and reasonably valid ability estimates. Four forms of a tonal memory test were administered to 125 college students. Results from a split-plot ANOVA of total test scores, a factor analysis of item clusters, and comparisons of test validity coefficients indicated that tonal and atonal items with synthesized timbre and varied rhythms were the most appropriate items to include in the adaptive test pool.    The goal of the second phase was to select a final set of adaptive test items and assess their reliability and validity. One of three forms of a 104-item tonal memory test was administered to each of 336 high school and college students. Each form contained items matching the prototypes identified in the first phase. One hundred eighty items from phases one and two that provided good discrimination across all musical ability levels were chosen for the final adaptive test pool. Results indicated that scores based on the adaptive test items provided more reliable and valid ability estimates than two widely used conventional tests, the Seashore Tonal Memory Test and the Drake Musical Memory Test.    The goal of the third phase was to assess the efficiency of the actual adaptive test by administering it to 20 examinees. An average of 6, 9 and 12 items was needed to obtain reliabilities of.80,.85, and.90 respectively.    Taken as a whole these results provide compelling evidence that many shortcomings of conventional music tests can be overcome by adaptive tests. Adaptive testing appears to hold great promise for significantly improving the assessment of musical abilities. The development of adaptive tests of other musical skills is recommended.

T1  - PRESSUREMETER CREEP TESTING IN LABORATORY ICE
AN  - 303532124
AB  - Single stage and multistage pressuremeter creep tests have been conducted in large, laboratory-prepared samples of polycrystalline ice at temperatures of -2(DEGREES)C. One purpose of the experimental program was to investigate the validity and applicability of two creep theories, the widely used simple power law theory (strain-hardening formulation) and the recently proposed modified second-order fluid model. Another purpose was to investigate the relationship between single stage and multistage pressuremeter creep tests, in the same stress range, and thus to deduce the effect of loading history on the creep parameters.    For both models, the creep information obtained from the multistage pressuremeter tests was found to compare very well with the information derived from single stage pressuremeter creep tests, both in terms of creep parameters and predicted long-term behaviour. The modified second-order fluid model, however, produced less scatter in the stress exponent n derived from the multistage tests than the simple power law model.    Through analysis of the multistage tests, it appears that the past history of applied stresses in a pressuremeter creep test has little effect on the nature of the creep; rather, the amount of accumulated strain appears to be the controlling factor.    For pressuremeter testing in ice or ice-rich frozen soils, it should be assumed that a steady-state creep condition will eventually prevail with continued straining. Each stress increment in a pressuremeter creep test should be applied until at least the steady-state condition is approached, as evidenced by a b (time exponent) of at least 0.90 or an exponentially increasing cavity radius with time. In order to attain the steady-state condition in a reasonable amount of time, a field multistage pressuremeter creep test may be started at any stress level.    With carefully run calibrations both before and after each test, the OYO Elastmeter-100 pressuremeter with an electronic radius measuring device performed exceedingly well in this experimental program. Analysis of the results, for the time being, should be conducted in terms of the simple power law creep theory in its steady-state form. Because it can represent both primary and secondary creep in the same motion equation and is valid for large strains, the modified second-order fluid model is preferable to the simple power law model. Solutions to selected boundary-value problems, however, must be solved before it can be used in practice.

T1  - Computer Application Issues in Certification and Licensure Testing
AN  - 63291950; ED261079
AB  - Computer adaptive testing systems are feasible for certification and licensure testing. This is in part due to the availability of extensive yet inexpensive computers. Modern item response theory, combined with computerized adaptive testing, yields a powerful new method of testing which provides greater accuracy and efficiency and less boredom for the examinee. The computer presents each item, scores it, and then selects the next item which is appropriate for the individual examinee; thus, individual testing is much more feasible than it would be using human examiners. There are additional advantages: acceptable accuracy can be achieved with fewer items; more accurate estimates can be obtained at the extreme ends of the ability continuum; test security is improved; tests can be administered on demand when needed; and a greater variety of item types may be included. With licensing and certification tests, it is important to obtain a good pool of test items, to be accurate near the minimum cutting score, to have appropriate unidimensionality, and to use computers in a comfortable environment. It is also useful to have a large number of examinees, approximately 1000 or more. Cost estimates are encouraging, especially when the computer systems are used often. (GDC)

T1  - Computer-Based Measurement of Intellectual Capabilities. Final Report
AN  - 63350164; ED248258
AB  - During 1975-1979 this research into the potential of computerized adaptive testing to reduce errors in the measurement of human capabilities used Marine recruits for a live-testing validity comparison of computerized adaptive and conventional tests. The program purposes were to: (1) identify the most useful computer-based adaptive testing strategies; (2) identify testing conditions that maximize the positive rather than negative psychological effects of computerized testing; (3) investigate intra-individual multidimensionality problems in ability testing; (4) examine probabilistic responding and free-response methods for computerized adaptive testing in order to extract maximum information from each test item response; and (5) develop, refine and evaluate new computer administered ability tests for spacial, perceptive, memory, and other abilities not now measurable using paper and pencil testing. Monte Carlo and Bayesian adaptive testing methods were used in these studies. Fifteen major findings, primarily on adaptive testing and test administration conditions, and implications for further research are given. Abstracts of the 16 research reports for studies for this program are given. (BS)

T1  - Bias and Information of Bayesian Adaptive Testing. Research Report 83-2
AN  - 63511192; ED230615
AB  - Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate score bias and information characteristics of Owen's Bayesian adaptive testing strategy, and to examine possible causes of score bias. Factors investigated in three related studies included effects of item discrimination, effects of fixed vs. variable test length, and effects of an accurate prior theta estimate. Data were generated from a three-parameter logistic model for 3,100 simulees in each of eight data sets; Bayesian adaptive tests were administered, drawing items from a "perfect" item pool. The results indicate that theta estimates from Owen's Bayesian adaptive testing method are affected by the prior theta estimate used and that the method does not provide measurements that are unbiased and equiprecise except under the unrealistic condition of an accurate prior theta estimate.

T1  - EFFECTS OF ITEM PARAMETER ERROR AND OTHER FACTORS ON TRAIT ESTIMATION IN LATENT TRAIT-BASED ADAPTIVE TESTING
AN  - 303161995
AB  - Latent trait estimates derived from adaptive testing were evaluated as a function of item response theory model, scoring method, level of a,b item pool correlation, test length, and degree of item parameter error. 1700 simulated subjects were "administered" items from a pool of 150 items using maximum information adaptive item selection. Each simulee was tested under 100 combinations of conditions, with trait estimation precision evaluated using inaccuracy, bias, root mean square error, information, and fidelity.    Results indicated little deterioration in trait estimates for realistic a, b, or c error. Very extreme b error alone or combined with other parameter error generated substantial deterioration for all models and test lengths. Shorter tests deteriorated most, and maximum likelihood (ML) scores deteriorated progressively more than Bayesian scores as item parameter error increased. r(a,b) level affected the results only at certain latent trait levels under very extreme b error.    Bayesian and ML scores had equal fidelities, while ML scores excelled using information. The other indices suggested ML superiority for lesser item parameter error and Bayesian superiority as error increased. Less error was needed for Bayesian superiority under simpler models.    The 2-parameter model was more precise that 1- or 3-parameter models for all but the bias index; its performance under considerable item parameter error equaled or exceeded the other two models with no item parameter error. Between-model differences were greater for Bayesian scoring, more extreme error conditions, shorter tests, and low or extreme trait values. Under extreme b error, differences varied widely but unsystematically with r(a,b).    Level of r(a,b) had little or no systematic effect on precision, although precision and test length increased concomitantly. Per-item precision increments were greatest for the 1- and 3-parameter models and, at certain trait levels, for more extreme error conditions.    Results suggest that latent trait estimates are robust to item parameter error, that interrelationships among variables are important considerations in adaptive testing design decisions, and that free response items should be more seriously considered.

T1  - Robustness of Adaptive Testing to Multidimensionality
AN  - 63284410; ED264270
AB  - The present monte carlo simulation study was designed to examine the effects of multidimensionality during the administration of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). It was assumed that multidimensionality existed in the individuals to whom test items were being administered, i.e., that the correct or incorrect responses given by an individual were generated from a specified multidimensional structure, rather than the unidimensional item response theory (IRT) model normally assumed to have generated the observable dichotomous test item responses. The dichotomous response was then treated for CAT item selection and ability estimation purposes as if it had been generated by the unidimensional model. To the extent that the observed item response was affected by dimensions other than the first (which corresponded to the single dimension assumed to underlie the item selection and ability estimation process) errors should be introduced into the adaptive testing process. These errors should affect the ability estimates and the efficiency of CAT. The study focused on the nature and degree of these errors under a variety of multidimensional structures, to determine how robust CAT is to the effects of multidimensionality in examinees' responses to test items.

T1  - A Model for Incorporating Response-Time Data in Scoring Achievement Tests. Research Report No. 3
AN  - 63686872; ED183621
AB  - The differences in types of information-processing skills developed by different instructional backgrounds affect, negatively or positively, the learning of further advanced instructional materials. If prior and subsequent instructional methods are different, a proactive inhibition effect produces low achievement scores on a post test. This poses a serious problem for routing of students to an instructional level on the sole basis of performance on a diagnostic adaptive test and makes it essential to determine what information-processing strategy was used and consider this knowledge simultaneously. Response time often provides supplementary information which differentiates among individuals showing identical quality of performance. A model that reflects this kind of information, obtainable from response time scores, is formulated in a similar manner to latent trait theory. This model is useful in identifying discriminating items that are sensitive to differences in instructional method. It also is helpful in identifying an individual's instructional background to a certain extent. (Author/CTM)

T1  - The Danger of Relying Solely on Diagnostic Adaptive Testing When Prior and Subsequent Instructional Methods Are Different. Research Report No. 2, October 1 through December 31, 1979
AN  - 63685650; ED183608
AB  - A situation in which computer-assisted instruction was combined with teacher-taught classes and computerized diagnostic adaptive testing was examined. The computerized diagnostic adaptive test for pre-algebra signed-number lessons was programmed along with a computer-managed routing system by which examinees were sent to the instructional unit corresponding to the skill level at which they stopped in the initial test. Upon completing the course a computerized conventional post test was administered. It was found that results differed markedly from results obtained in a previous study. A cluster analysis was performed on the response patterns of the skills, and four different groups were found. A discriminant analysis indicated significant differences among the four groups in response patterns of the skills in signed number operations. It was determined that differences between prior and current instructional methods confused students and caused confusion in the post-test data, and that the scoring procedure of the adaptive testing was not sensitive to individual differences in information processing skills which were affected by the instructional method used in previous teaching. It was concluded that reliance should not be placed solely on test results determined by performance scores on a diagnostic pretest. (Author/CTM)

T1  - A Comparison of the Fairness of Adaptive and Conventional Testing Strategies. Research Report 78-1
AN  - 63740375; ED163036
AB  - This report examines how selection fairness is influenced by the characteristics of a selection instrument in terms of its distribution of item difficulties, level of item discrimination, degree of item bias, and testing strategy. Computer simulation was used in the administration of either a conventional or Bayesian adaptive ability test to a hypothetical target population consisting of a minority and majority subgroup. Fairness was evaluated by three indices which reflect the degree of differential validity, errors in prediction (Cleary's model), and proportion of applicants exceeding a selection cutoff (Thorndike's model). Major findings are: (1) when used in conjunction with either the Bayesian or conventional test, differential prediction increased fairness and facilitated the interpretation of the fairness indices; (2) the Bayesian adaptive tests were consistently fairer than the conventional tests for all item pools above the alpha=.7 discrimination level for tests of more than 30 items; (3) the differential prediction version of the Bayesian adaptive test produced almost perfectly fair performance on all fairness indices at high discrimination levels; and (4) the placement of subgroup prior distribution in the Bayesian adaptive testing procedure can affect test fairness.

T1  - Evaluations of Implied Orders as a Basis for Tailored Testing Using Simulations. Technical Report No. 4
AN  - 63821174; ED147369
AB  - TAILOR is a computer program that uses the implied orders concept as the basis for computerized adaptive testing. The basic characteristics of TAILOR, which does not involve pretesting, are reviewed here and two studies of it are reported. One is a Monte Carlo simulation based on the four-parameter Birnbaum model and the other uses a matrix of children's item responses to the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. In the Birnbaum model study, a variety of conditions were simulated; it was found that TAILOR typically used responses to about half the items and achieved validities with the true score within a few points of the validity of the complete test. Item discrimination parameters affected the efficiency of TAILOR. The Binet study used correlations between scores based on one bank of tailored items and another independent, parallel set and found results similar to those in the Birnbaum simulation. TAILOR, like other adaptive testing systems, apparently can aid efficiency when item discriminations are high or when ability variance is large. (Author/MV)

T1  - Psychological Effects of Immediate Knowledge of Results and Adaptive Ability Testing. Research Report 76-4
AN  - 63908573; ED129863
AB  - The effects of providing immediate knowledge of results (KR) and adaptive testing on test anxiety and test-taking motivation were investigated. Also studied was the accuracy of student perceptions of the difficulty of adaptive and conventional tests administered with or without immediate knowledge of results. Testees were 350 college students divided into high- and low-ability groups and randomly assigned to one of four test strategies by KR conditions. The ability level of examinees was found to be related to their reported levels of motivation and to differences in reported motivation under the different testing conditions. These results suggest that adaptive testing creates a psychological environment for testing which is more equivalently motivating for examinees of all ability levels and results in a greater standardization of the test-taking environment, than does conventional testing.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Ability Measurement
AN  - 63914574; ED128404
AB  - The general objective of a research program on adaptive testing was to identify several sources of potential error in test scores, and to study adaptive testing as a means for reducing these errors. Errors can result from the mismatch of item difficulty to the individual's ability; the psychological effects of testing and the test environment; the inability to extract enough information from the testee's response; deviations from unidimensionality; and an oversimplistic conceptualization of ability. Several different strategies of adaptive testing are discussed, along with the information level they yield, and the bias that can result from various scoring methods. In a discussion of the unidimentionality of test items, the consistency of the testee's response is analyzed. Finally, group differences are examined in terms of the psychological effects of receiving immediate feedback, especially on low ability groups. The author concludes that adaptive testing and immediate knowledge of results may be able to provide testing conditions more conclusive to each person's ability to demonstrate his/her fullest capacities in test performance.

T1  - ABILITY MEASUREMENT, TEST BIAS REDUCTION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTIONS TO TESTING AS A FUNCTION OF COMPUTER ADAPTIVE TESTING VERSUS CONVENTIONAL TESTING
AN  - 302020669
AB  - The effects of a test bias reduction technique on measurement precision in conventional and computer adaptive tests were investigated. Also, the relationships between test type, bias reduction procedures, and examinees' psychological reactions to testing were investigated. Latent trait theory was used in the construction and evaluation of the conventional and adaptive tests which were both administered on a computer terminal. The test items administered in this study were from the Scholastic Aptitude Test verbal section. The adaptive test used a Bayesian sequential item selection strategy to construct individualized 15-item tests for each examinee. The conventional test administered a fixed set of 15 items selected to measure equally well over the entire range of examinee ability.    The test bias reduction technique is a three step procedure for selecting items either interactively (adaptive) or a priori (conventional) to be in a test. First, the desired difficulty of the new item is specified. Second, either four or seven items with difficulty levels nearest the desired level are selected from the item pool. Third, the item with the lowest bias is selected to be in the test. The test bias reduction technique substantially reduced the bias index of the items administered to the examinees but also resulted in lower measurement precision of examinee ability. This effect on measurement precision was larger for the conventional test than the adaptive test. The levels of bias reduction, four items scanned for lowest bias compared to seven items scanned, made no difference on the measurement precision of the adaptive test. However, these levels of bias reduction made a difference on the measurement precision of the conventional test.    The adaptive test resulted in higher Bayesian modal estimates of ability than those from the conventional test. However, examinees perceived the adaptive test to be more difficult than the conventional test.    Examinees' psychological reactions of perceive guessing and perceived performance were affected by the type of test, adaptive or conventional, and were related to test performance independent of examinee ability. Also, the relationship between these psychological reactions and performance was generally greater for conventional than adaptive tests. Therefore, adaptive testing might affect performance scores differently than conventional testing through mediating psychological processes.    These findings are discussed in addition to possible directions for future research.

T1  - Development of a set of patient reported outcome measures for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts: patient focus groups and systematic review
AN  - 2748664452
AB  - BackgroundPatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be useful for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts (BLTC) to evaluate the impact of treatment and/or guide shared decision making. Yet, a set of PROMs relevant to patients with BLTC is currently unavailable. In this study, we selected a PROMs set for patients with BLTC.MethodsPotentially relevant patient reported outcomes (PROs) were selected by psychologist-researchers based on keywords used or suggested by participants of two virtual focus groups meetings consisting of thirteen female BLTC patients with a median age of 50 years. Subsequently, patients were asked to report their most relevant PROs. PROMs identified by systematic literature review and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) were considered in selecting the final PROMs set to assess relevant outcomes.ResultsThe most important PROs were: insecurity/anxiety (11/12 patients), pain (9/12 patients), fatigue (8/12 patients), and limitations in daily life (5/12 patients). The literature review included 23 studies, which used various generic and disease-specific PROMs, often not measuring (all) relevant PROs. The final selected PROMs set included numerical rating scales for pain, two questions on overall health and quality of life and four PROMIS CATs.ConclusionsA PROMs set generically and efficiently measuring outcomes relevant for patients with BLTC was developed and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

T1  - Computer adaptive testing to assess impairing behavioral health problems in emergency department patients with somatic complaints
AN  - 2729945609
AB  - ObjectivesTo assess: (1) the prevalence of mental health and substance use in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through use of a computer adaptive test (CAT‐MH), (2) the correlation among CAT‐MH scores and self‐ and clinician‐reported assessments, and (3) the association between CAT‐MH scores and ED utilization in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment.MethodsThis was a single‐center observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED for somatic complaints (97%) from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes were computer‐adaptive‐assessed domains of suicidality, depression, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We conducted Pearson correlations and logistic regression for objectives 2 and 3, respectively.ResultsFrom a sample of 794 patients, the proportion of those at moderate/severe risk was: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). CAT‐MH domains were highly correlated with self‐report assessments (r = 0.49–0.79). Individuals who had 2 or more ED visits in the prior year had 62% increased odds of being in the intermediate‐high suicide risk category (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–2.44) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. Individuals who scored in the intermediate‐high‐suicide risk group had 63% greater odds of an ED visit within 30 days after enrollment compared to those who scored as low risk (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.44).ConclusionThe CAT‐MH documented that a considerable proportion of ED patients presenting for somatic problems had mental health conditions, even if mild. Mental health problems were also associated with ED utilization.

T1  - Automated Speech Audiometry for Integrated Voice Over Internet Protocol Communication Services
AN  - 2717146391
AB  - Purpose: Problems in speech recognition are often apparent in telecommunication situations. For ecologically valid assessments of such conditions, it is important to quantify the impact of real environments including acoustic conditions at a far-end communication device and all paths of transmission degradation. This study presents an automated matrix sentence test procedure based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) integrated in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure and compares the individual effects of transmission degradations with results from laboratory measurements. Method: Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in 16 normalhearing subjects in four test conditions: (a) a laboratory condition guided by a human experimenter, (b) a laboratory condition with reduced bandwidth and (c) additionally reduced headset quality to simulate typical communication systems, and (d) an automated, ASR-controlled adaptive test procedure over a real VoIP infrastructure. Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and "laboratory" conditions, with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.

T1  - The Impact of Local Item Dependence on Computer Adaptive Testing Given Between and Within Testlet Adaptivity
AN  - 2729529785
AB  - In educational tests, a group of questions related to a shared stimulus is called a testlet (e.g., a reading passage with multiple related questions). Use of testlets is very common in educational tests. Additionally, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a mode of testing where the test forms are created in real time tailoring to the test taker's previous responses. CATs have gained popularity because they produce a more accurate test score estimate within a shorter time with fewer questions. In this dissertation, the performance of CAT with testlets was studied. 
Conditional independence is an essential assumption of Item Response Models. However, when testlets are used, item responses to the items in the same testlet may not be independent since these items are associated with a common stimulus. In this case, the conditional independence assumption is violated, and this violation can affect the entire performance of CAT and lead to inaccurate test scores. 
Common practice for testlet based CATs is to select a testlet adaptively and administer all the items bundled in the testlet. However, the accuracy and efficiency aspects of CAT may not be fully realized with this approach of adaptivity. To increase the accuracy and efficiency in testlet-based CATs, between and within testlet adaptivity was studied. Other manipulated variables were the level of adaptivity, different testlet/item selection approaches, latent trait estimation methods, test length/number of testlets, and magnitude of testlet dependence. The performances of testlet based CATs with various scenarios were evaluated descriptively by running a series of simulations. One of the important findings of the study is that not only between testlets but also within testlets adaptation improved the performance of the CAT for more accurate and precise estimation of the latent traits. The results will serve as a baseline for future research and practice.

T1  - Psychometric Performance of a Condition-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument for Dutch Children Born with Esophageal Atresia
AN  - 2728451966
AB  - A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL©) to assess quality of life of children born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance in Dutch children. After Swedish–Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old children, 8/17 items had >5% missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual child’s situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in different countries are needed.

T1  - Improving Test Security and Efficiency of Computerized Adaptive Testing for the Force Concept Inventory
AN  - 2722551713; EJ1343470
AB  - This paper presents improvements made to a computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-based version of the FCI (FCI-CAT) in regards to test security and test efficiency. First, we will discuss measures to enhance test security by controlling for item overexposure, decreasing the risk that respondents may (i) memorize the content of a pretest for use on the post-test or (ii) share information about the items with their classmates who take the assessment later. Second, we will discuss measures to enhance test efficiency, so that a shorter test length can yield a desired accuracy and precision of the measurement. Specifically, we utilized collateral information in the form of a pretest proficiency estimate of each respondent for selecting items and estimating respondent proficiency level in the post-test. To shorten the total testing time further, we also allowed the test lengths to be different for the pre- and post-test. To analyze how these improvements affect the accuracy and precision (which we measure in terms of root-mean-square error) of Cohen's d, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation and a "post hoc" simulation. Then, we calculated the minimal test length of the FCI-CAT whose accuracy and precision are equivalent to that of the paper-and-pencil version of the FCI. Consequently, we obtained the following three findings: (i) By using collateral information, we can achieve the accuracy and precision of the full-length FCI with fewer items via the FCI-CAT. (ii) For a class size of 40, we can control for test security while still reducing the sum of the pre- and post-test lengths of the FCI-CAT to a total of 33 items (17 items on the pretest and 16 items on the post-test), thereby reducing the testing time to 55%. (iii) If one's goal is to maximize test efficiency, the pretest length should be slightly larger than the post-test length. On the other hand, if the goal is to maximize test security, the pretest length should be smaller and the post-test length should be larger. If one desires a balance of these two goals, it would be reasonable to choose equal pre- and post-test lengths.

T1  - Developing a Web-Based App to Assess Mental Health Difficulties in Secondary School Pupils: Qualitative User-Centered Design Study
AN  - 2624025081
AB  - Background: Secondary schools are an ideal setting to identify young people experiencing mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression. However, current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment.
Objective: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools.
Methods: This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cycles—an initial stakeholder consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed.
Results: Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for designing mental health assessment apps are also provided.
Conclusions: Artemis-A is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training. Future research will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Artemis-A in a range of UK secondary schools.

T1  - Item Characteristic Curve Asymmetry: A Better Way to Accommodate Slips and Guesses than a Four-Parameter Model?
AN  - 2608863707; EJ1317106
AB  - Four-parameter models have received increasing psychometric attention in recent years, as a reduced upper asymptote for item characteristic curves can be appealing for measurement applications such as adaptive testing and person-fit assessment. However, applications can be challenging due to the large number of parameters in the model. In this article, we demonstrate in the context of mathematics assessments how the slip and guess parameters of a four-parameter model may often be empirically related. This observation also has a psychological explanation to the extent that both asymptote parameters may be manifestations of a single item complexity characteristic. The relationship between lower and upper asymptotes motivates the consideration of an asymmetric item response theory model as a three-parameter alternative to the four-parameter model. Using actual response data from mathematics multiple-choice tests, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of a three-parameter asymmetric model in several standardized tests of mathematics. To the extent that a model of asymmetry ultimately portrays slips and guesses not as purely random but rather as proficiency-related phenomena, we argue that the asymmetric approach may also have greater psychological plausibility.

T1  - Estimating Psychometric Properties of Computerized Multistage Testing
AN  - 2572971681
AB  - In recent decades, computerized multistage testing (MST) has been utilized as an alternative testing mode for large-scale testing programs. Although the usage of MST has been discussed extensively, there is little literature that addresses its psychometric properties. The motivation of this dissertation arises from the need to properly estimate psychometric properties under the MST framework. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrated set of formulas for estimating psychometric properties for MST, including error variance, reliability, and classification indices. To achieve this goal, existing methods that are used for the traditional P\&P tests are extended to the MST context, if possible; and new methods are proposed based on the characteristics of MST (i.e., routing probability) for the ML and EAP estimators. For the ML estimator, a conventional approach to computing MST test information analytically is also included for estimating the psychometric properties. The proposed approach and the conventional approach are then applied to a single set of MST data, with varied conditions. Further, a simulation approach is employed for the purpose of understanding and comparing the performance of the proposed approach and conventional approach. In the simulation approach, replications of test data are used to obtain results.
The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) for the ML estimator, the proposed analytic approach performed better than the conventional approach, indicated by comparing their results with those from the simulation approach; (2) for the EAP estimator, results from using the Bayesian approach approach led to smaller values of marginal error variances and higher values of reliability, compared with the quadrature approach; (3) longer test resulted in decreased error variances and improved reliability; (4) for the EAP Bayesian approach, increasing sample size had a limited impact on the estimation results; (5) for all the approaches, conditional classification consistency and accuracy gradually decreased when the ability parameter was moving further away from the cut scores. All of the estimation formulas provided in this dissertation can be applied directly to MST data in practice.

T1  - Evaluation of the measurement properties of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) in Hispanic caregivers to patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders
AN  - 2448808299
AB  - Objectives:The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used measure of perceived stress; however, minimal psychometric evaluation has been performed among Hispanic respondents, and even less among Hispanic caregivers to persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRDs).Design:Secondary data analysis.Setting:New York City, NY, USA.Participants:A sample of 453 community dwelling Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD.Measurements:Latent variable models were used to evaluate the PSS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine unidimensionality. Differential item functioning (DIF) was examined for age, education, and language using the graded item response model.Results:The factor and bifactor analyses results supported essential unidimensionality of the item set; however, positively worded items were observed using response item theory to be less informative than the negatively worded items. Reliability estimates were high. Salient DIF was not observed for age, education, or language of interview using the primary DIF detection method. Sensitivity analyses using a second DIF detection method identified uniform language-DIF for the item, “In the last month, how often have you felt that you were on top of things?” However, the non-compensatory DIF value was below the threshold considered salient.Conclusions:In summary, the 10-item PSS performed well in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. Very little DIF, and none of high magnitude and impact, was observed. However, the negatively worded items, perhaps because they are more directly reflective of stress, were more informative. In the context of a short-form measure or computerized adaptive test, more informative items are those that would be selected for inclusion.

T1  - Development of a computerized adaptive substance use disorder scale for screening and measurement: the CAT‐SUD: (Alcoholism and Drug Addiction)
AN  - 2411430799
AB  - Background and aimsThe focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multi‐dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risk‐taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the item‐bank, (2) calibrate the item‐bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptom‐specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CAT‐SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain.DesignItem bank construction, item calibration phase, CAT‐SUD validation phase.SettingPrimary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patient‐to‐patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles).Participants/casesCalibration phase: the CAT‐SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CAT‐SUD.MeasurementsA total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CAT‐SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis.FindingsCalibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multi‐dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168‐item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100‐point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CAT‐SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20‐fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CAT‐SUD (AUC = 0.85).ConclusionsWe have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multi‐dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CAT‐SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

T1  - Stopping Rules for Computer Adaptive Testing When Item Banks Have Nonuniform Information
AN  - 2400034544
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

T1  - <strong>Assessment of Fatigue in Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease:</strong> Validation of PROMIS Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test and Identifying Correlates of Fatigue in Patients with End-Stage Kdney Disease
AN  - 2466269139
AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD.

T1  - Comparison of patient-reported outcomes measurement information system and legacy instruments in multiple domains among older veterans with chronic back pain
AN  - 2444064198
AB  - Background 
Chronic low back pain (cLBP) results in significant physical, psycho-social and socioeconomic burden. Identifying efficient and reliable patient reported outcome measures is critical for research and clinical purposes. The NIH’s Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments have not been compared to validated “legacy” instruments in older adults with cLBP. This study evaluates construct (convergent and discriminant) validity and time to complete (TTC) PROMIS as compared to legacy instruments.
 Methods 
We enrolled older Veterans (age 60+) with cLBP with/without leg pain scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Subjects completed PROMIS computer adaptive test item banks and corresponding legacy instruments in the following domains: pain intensity, interference, and behavior; functional status; depression and anxiety; fatigue; sleep and social functioning. Convergent and discriminant validity between PROMIS and legacy instruments was evaluated using Spearman rank order correlations; Mann-Whitney U tests compared TTC.
 Results 
Of the 71 Veterans recruited, the median (IQR) age was 67 (63–71) years old, 94% were men, 76% were White, 17% Black, and 96% were Non-Hispanic. Spearman correlations between PROMIS and legacy instruments showed moderate to very strong convergent validity in all domains (r = 0.4–1.0), except for social functioning and pain behavior (PROMIS Pain Behavior with Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire). The total median TTC for all PROMIS items was significantly shorter than legacy items, 8 min 50 s vs 29 min 14 s respectively, p < 0.001.
 Conclusions 
Given time efficiency of using PROMIS, along with strong construct validity, PROMIS instruments are a practical choice for measuring multidimensional PROs in older Veterans with cLBP for both research and clinical purposes.

T1  - Are student nurses ready for new technologies in mental health? Mixed-methods study
AN  - 2338151433
AB  - Background Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. Method Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. Results We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.

T1  - Performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF Procedures in a Computerized Multistage Testing Environment
AN  - 2647707280
AB  - This study investigates the performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF procedures independently and in comparative terms in a computerized multistage testing (MST) environment. A simulation study was conducted to mimic an operational testing environment. Three factors that may typically affect DIF detection in an MST environment were manipulated – sample size (250, 500), impact (0, 0.5, 1) and DIF magnitude (0.45, 0.9). A fourth factor (DIF method) was included at the analysis stage to understand its effect on the outcomes. The criteria for evaluating the results were Type I error rates and power rates. Results reveal that MH has better control of Type I error rates across various study conditions. With respect to power, MH was more powerful in detecting large DIF for the large sample size condition (power rate of 1.00) compared to CATSIB, which had power rates between .84 and 1.00 under the same conditions. Regression results reveal that there were interaction effects of the study factors on Type I error rates and power rates. These results will guide practitioners on best practices regarding DIF detection procedures under various conditions in computerized MST environments. This research adds to the extant literature that promotes psychometric methods that can assist in ensuring that operational test scores are aligned with the principals of item-level statistical fairness.

T1  - Adult Learning across USA, Canada, and New Zealand: A Cross-Cultural Study of PIAAC
AN  - 2461117162; EJ1214292
AB  - Skeptics of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trend for International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) argue that while US elementary and high school students are behind their peers in other nations, the US workforce is still excellent because of the high quality post-secondary educational institutions in the US. However, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) indicates that US adults are in fact far behind their international peers in literacy, numeracy, and technology-based problem solving. Through the use of data mining, this study explored the possible association between PIAAC scores and several constructs. Since the US, Canada, and New Zealand were considered culturally similar nations, according to cluster analysis, patterns between PIAAC scores and selected constructs were analyzed by a variety of big data analytical methods, including cluster analysis, bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and data visualization. Given that PIAAC used multiple computerized adaptive testing, the consequential plausible values were randomly selected when the ensemble approach was used. Additionally, model comparison was utilized to decide between bagging and boosting in order to select the optimal model for each sample. In these samples, cultural engagement, readiness to learn, and social trust, respectively emerged as strong predictors for learning outcomes as they were assessed by PIAAC.

T1  - Optimizing Design of Incorporating Off-Grade Items for Constrained Computerized Adaptive Testing in K-12 Assessment
AN  - 2305945464
AB  - Incorporating off-grade items within an on-grade item pool is often seen in K-12 testing programs. Incorporating off-grade items may provide improvements in measurement precision, test length, and content blueprint fulfillment, especially for high- and low-performing examinees, but it may also identify some concerns when using too many off-grade items on tests that are primarily designed to measure grade-level standards. This dissertation investigates how practical constraints such as the number of on-grade items, the proportion, and range of off-grade items, and the stopping rules affect item pool characteristics and item pool performance in adaptive testing.This study includes simulation conditions with four study factors: (1) three on-grade pool sizes (150, 300, and 500 items), (2) three proportions of off-grade items in the item pool (small, moderate, and large), (3) two ranges of off-grade items (one grade level and two grade levels), and (4) two stopping rules (variable- and fixed-length stopping rule) with two SE threshold levels. All the results are averaged across 200 replications for each simulation condition.The item pool characteristics are summarized using descriptive statistics and histograms of item difficulty (the b-parameters), descriptive statistics and plots of test information functions (TIFs), and the standard errors of the ability estimate (SEEs). The item pool performance is evaluated based on the descriptive statistics of measurement precision, test length and exposure properties, content blueprint fulfillment, and mean proportion of off-grade items for each test.The results show that there are some situations in which incorporating off-grade items would be beneficial. For example, a testing organization with a small item pool attempting to improve item pool performance for high- and low-performing examinees. The results also show that practical constraints of incorporating off-grade items, organized here from most impact to least impact in item pool characteristics and item pool performance, are: 1) incorporating off-grade items into small baseline pool or large baseline pool; 2) broadening the range of off-grade items from one grade level to two grade levels; 3) increasing the proportion of off-grade items in the item pool; and 4) applying variable- or fixed-length CAT. The results indicated that broadening the range of off-grade items yields improvements in measurement precision and content blueprint fulfillment when compared to increasing the proportion of off-grade items. This study could serve as guidance for test organizations when considering the benefits and limitations of incorporating off-grade items into on-grade item pools.

T1  - Exam Anxiety: Using Paired Adaptive Tests to Reduce Stress in Business Classes
AN  - 2228651872; EJ1203830
AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

T1  - Predictors of health-related quality of life in chronically ill children and adolescents over time
AN  - 2088836455
AB  - Objective This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. Methods Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; aged 7–17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. Results Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. Conclusions HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

T1  - Accuracy of the of the PROMIS-57 questionnaire to identify significant depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients on hemodialysis
AN  - 2088794123
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone© crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

T1  - Correlation of PROMIS CAT instruments with Oswestry Disability Index in chiropractic patients
AN  - 2088124940
AB  - Background The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Methods All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. Results The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170 ± 67 s (average ± Stdev) to answer 25 ± 6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R2 values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R2 values of 0.5236. Conclusions PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

T1  - Improving Assessment of Work Related Mental Health Function Using the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB)
AN  - 2006744623
AB  - Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security Administration’s (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood & emotions, resilience, social interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition & communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental health subdomains: Cognition & Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 items), Resilience & Sociability (29 items) and Mood & Emotions (34 items). All scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational rehabilitation settings.

T1  - Comparison of Two Test Methods for VIS: Paper-Pencil Test and CAT
AN  - 2155996241; EJ1192194
AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

T1  - Predicting Certification Success for the Family Nurse Practitioner
AN  - 2050014573
AB  - High-stakes licensure or certification examinations are required for many health professions disciplines to ensure safe entry-level practice. Accrediting agencies set a benchmark for graduates’ first-time licensure or certification success as a measure of program effectiveness. Failures of graduates on licensure or certification examinations may directly affect the school’s recruitment and retention of qualified students and faculty, as well as institutional financial viability. A health science university has added Health Education System, Inc. (HESI) standardized examinations using computer adaptive testing into the family nurse practitioner (FNP) master’s program to support certification success, although research on these advanced practice examinations as related to certification outcomes was lacking. Guided by classical test theory, this study was an investigation of whether a relationship existed between students’ performance on 4 HESI standardized examinations (Advanced Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacotherapeutics, Advanced Health Assessment, and the APRN/FNP Exit exam) and first-time FNP certification success. Binary logistic regression analysis of data from 117 students who graduated between 2013–2016 indicated that none of the 4 standardized HESI examinations significantly predicted FNP certification success, perhaps due to the examinations not carrying any evaluative weight within the program. The results of this project study may be used to promote positive social change by providing a means to improve first-time certification success and increasing the availability of primary care providers in the role of FNP.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing in Pediatric Brain Tumor Clinics
AN  - 1963430746
AB  - Context: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. Objective: This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. Methods: Patients (ages 7-22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. Results: Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

T1  - Aberrant response detection using change-point analysis
AN  - 1874567901
AB  - Aberrant responses, which are caused by examinees' unusual behaviors (e.g., carelessness, speededness, item pre-knowledge, warm-up, copying answers from neighbors), are frequently seen in various testing programs. Having aberrant responses may bias item parameter estimates and threaten test validity. Thus proper modeling and detection of aberrant responses is crucial both theoretically and practically in educational and psychological measurement.    Previous work has primarily approached the aberrant responses research in terms of developing person fit statistics and proposing models to capture the aberrant behaviors. This dissertation attempts to incorporate change-point analysis (CPA) to investigate two types of aberrant responses: speededness and warm-up effect; both of which can be viewed as having an abrupt change point. This is an extension work of Shao, Li, and Cheng (in press) which first introduced the CPA method to detect test speededness with known item parameters. Following this line of research, three studies are carried out.    The first study investigates whether CPA can help improve item calibration in the presence of speededness. In this study, the CPA method is used to first detect speeded responses with unknown item parameters. After the detection of speeded examinees as well as their corresponding speeding point (the point at which an examinee starts to speed), a cleansing procedure based upon the detected speeding point is proposed to help improve item parameter estimation. The performance of speededness detection as well as the item parameter recovery before/after utilizing the cleansing procedure are evaluated.    The second study applies the CPA method to warm-up effect detection. This study first compares the impact of warm-up effect on ability estimation and examinees' classification accuracy on two types of tests: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Paper and Pencil (linear) Testing. In the second step, the CPA based detection of warm-up effect is carried out. Two methods of obtaining the critical values are utilized in the study.    Different from the first two studies which both conduct CPA using item response information, the third study applies CPA to response time data in speededness detection. A gradual change log-normal model is proposed to better model the real-life change of response time affected by speededness. Two test statistics are introduced to test for a change point using response time. Moreover, this study explores the possibility of using a fixed critical value across conditions at each nominal level so that practitioners do not have to obtain a critical value through simulation every time they run speededness detection.    The dissertation thesis concludes with the final chapter including a discussion of the results, limitations, practical implications, and future directions.

T1  - Investigating Robustness of Item Response Theory Proficiency Estimators to Atypical Response Behaviors under Two-Stage Multistage Testing. ETS GRE® Board Research Report. ETS GRE®-16-03. ETS Research Report No. RR-16-22
AN  - 1895976126; EJ1124833
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which item response theory (IRT) proficiency estimation methods are robust to the presence of aberrant responses under the "GRE"® General Test multistage adaptive testing (MST) design. To that end, a wide range of atypical response behaviors affecting as much as 10% of the test items were simulated using a generic GRE 2-stage MST and the 2-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model. As expected, some differences were found among the 5 estimators in terms of the recovery of the true theta ability; for example, Bayesian estimators had lower error variance and their estimates were regressed to the mean.Once the IRT theta estimates were scaled onto a comparable reporting score scale, however, it was found that all the estimation methods investigated, including the one currently used to score GRE MSTs, were equally robust under the simulated conditions.

T1  - Methods for Hypothesis Testing in Animal Carcinogenicity Experiments
AN  - 1830448193
AB  - Animal carcinogenicity experiments are conducted by private entities and government agencies to investigate whether a substance causes cancer. Since most tumors are occult and it is necessary to conduct a necropsy to detect the presence of cancer, producing unbiased tests for differences in tumor incidence is challenging. The highest doses given in these experiments often have toxic effects in the animals or might affect tumor lethality, and many common statistical methods for survival data perform poorly when such effects induce differences in mortality across treatment groups. The poly- k test, developed by Bailer & Portier (1988) as a modification of the Cochran-Armitage test, was designed to avoid problems from differential mortality, but is based on strong parametric assumptions, specifically that underlying tumor hazard may be modeled as Weibull with shape parameter  k (usually set to 3). Existing literature that examines the performance of the poly-k and competitor tests assumes Weibull tumor hazards, and finds that the poly-k can be biased under treatment toxicity when its shape parameter assumption is not met. Given that this test has become a standard for government agencies such as the National Toxicology Program and the FDA, closer examination is warranted. Our simulations examine the performance of the poly-k under non-Weibull tumor hazards, and find that our own parametric tests can outperform it under these conditions. For tests like the poly-k, our goal is to develop and examine the performance of adaptive testing algorithms that estimate a test's parameter based on the data; one such estimation was suggested under Weibull assumptions by Moon et al. (2003), though their approach based on estimating lifetime cumulative tumor incidence rates does not make full use of the available data, and requires that the experiment include multiple interim sacrifices for adequate performance. Under most of our simulation settings, our kˆ MLE test, based on estimating the shape parameter  k by maximizing the full likelihood, has type I error and power very similar to the poly-k test with correctly-specified  k, and it maintains size better, with comparable or higher power, than the test based on the Moon et al. estimate. Our MLE-based test does not require interim sacrifices, although it may perform better under some interim sacrifice experimental designs. We compare these tests under a variety of parametric assumptions and serial sacrifice designs to examine which experimental settings are most optimal for test performance.

T1  - Non-parametric item response theory applications in the assessment of dementia
AN  - 1857763144
AB  - This thesis sought to address the application of non-parametric item response theory (NIRT) to cognitive and functional assessment in dementia. Performance on psychometric tests is key to diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. NIRT can be used to improve the psychometric properties of tests used in dementia assessment in multiple ways: confirming an underlying unidimensional structure, establishing formal item hierarchical patterns of decline, increasing insight by examining item parameters such as difficulty and discrimination, and creating shorter tests. From a NIRT approach item difficulty refers to the ease with which an item is endorsed. Discrimination is an index of how well an item can differentiate between patients of varying levels of severity. Firstly I carried out a systematic review to identify applications of both parametric and non-parametric IRT to measures assessing global cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This review demonstrated that IRT can increase the interpretive power of cognitive assessment scales and confirmed the limited number of IRT analyses of cognitive scales in dementia populations. This thesis extended this approach by applying Mokken scaling analysis to commonly used measures of current cognitive ability (Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)) and of premorbid cognitive ability (National Adult Reading Test (NART)). Differential item functioning (DIF) by diagnosis identified slight variations in the patterns of hierarchical decline in the ACE-R. These disease-specific sequences of decline could serve as an adjunct to diagnosis, for example where learning a name and address is a more difficult task than being orientated in time, late onset Alzheimer’s disease is a more probable diagnosis than mixed Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. These analyses also allowed key items to be identified which can be used to create briefer scales (mini-ACE and Mini-NART) which have good psychometric properties. These scales are clinically relevant, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items. They also allow sensitive measurement and adaptive testing and can reduce test administration time and patient stress. Impairment of functional abilities represents a crucial component of dementia diagnosis with performance on these functional tasks predictive of overall disease. A second aspect of this thesis, therefore, was the application of Mokken scaling analyses to measures of functional decline in dementia, specifically the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS). While gender DIF was observed for several items, implying the likelihood of equal responses from men and women is not equal a generally consistent pattern of impairment in functional ability was observed across different types of dementia.

T1  - Recent stress history effects in clays and associated improvements to the brick model
AN  - 1827521410
AB  - It is known that the stiffness of many soils is higher at small strains than at the large strains used in typical triaxial testing. Understanding this initial high stiffness and the factors affecting it is key to accurate displacement predictions. The recent stress history (RSH) effect describes how the stiffness degradation curve at small strains is affected by the immediately preceding stress path. The effect is usually described in terms of stress path rotation angle between an approach path and the shear probe upon which stiffness degradation is measured. The principle aim of the work was to investigate the relationship between the RSH effect, approach path length, and time dependent effects in more detail. A combination of physical testing and simulations with the BRICK constitutive model were used to achieve this. This has shown that in multistage testing the residual RSH effect from the first test increased the stiffness exhibited in the second, thus masking the natural behaviour. In addition the stress path rotation from consolidation to testing caused a stiffness reduction in the first test. This effect, newly termed recent consolidation history (RCH), was found to be degraded by the first test and so did not impact on the second. When allowance was made for these effects trends seen in the literature were supported. Due to the complex stress paths used in the physical testing, a number of improvements were required to the strain rate dependent (SRD) BRICK model to allow accurate simulations to be run. These included implementation of a bisecting iteration within the strain calculations, and a coordinate decent routine to allow creep and creep rupture to be modelled. The model was then used to simulate the physical tests to allow more insight into the interplay between the effects identified in the physical testing, ultimately supporting the conclusions drawn.

T1  - New group testing paradigms: From practice to theory
AN  - 1751005379
AB  - We propose a novel group testing framework, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome screening experiments in addition to other applications such as interpretable rule learning for decision making. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an integer-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a unifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing models are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the notion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable test matrices, representing generalizations of classical disjunct and separable matrices. We describe combinatorial and probabilistic constructions for such matrices without considering any restriction on the thresholds of the SQGT model (i.e. SQGT with arbitrary thresholds). Then, we focus on the important special case in which the thresholds are equidistant, and construct SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable matrices for this model. While for most of the constructions described in this dissertation, it is assumed that the number of defectives is much smaller than total number of test subjects, we also consider the case in which there is no restriction on the number of defectives and they may be as large as the total number of subjects. For the constructed matrices, we describe a number of efficient decoding algorithms based on algebraic methods and message passing on graphical models. Finally, we introduce the novel probabilistic group testing framework of Poisson group testing, applicable to dynamic testing with diminishing relative rates of defectives. For this new model, we consider both nonadaptive and adaptive testing schemes and develop lower bounds and tight constructive upper bounds on the number of required tests.

T1  - The EORTC emotional functioning computerized adaptive test: phases I-III of a cross-cultural item bank development
AN  - 1515781565
AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

T1  - Comparing the Effect of Two Types of Computer Screen Background Lighting on Students' Reading Engagement and Achievement
AN  - 1871572088; ED568528
AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

T1  - Designing <i>p</i>-Optimal Item Pools for Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 1615091454
AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the  p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context.   The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24  p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature.   Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

T1  - Student Perceptions of Barriers to Success on the Nursing Exit Exam
AN  - 1566941687
AB  - Nursing programs increasingly use exit exams to increase graduating nursing students' readiness for the nurse licensing examination. These exams prepare students for computer adaptive testing and identify areas where remediation is needed. This study examines an Associate Degree in Nursing program that has shown consistently low exit exam scores causing delays in student graduation, eligibility to sit for the licensing exam, and entry into the workforce. The study was crafted to investigate student perspectives of the barriers to student success on the Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) exit exam. It employed a quantitative one-shot survey design to evaluate factors related to performance on the HESI exit exam, including lack of study time, lack of knowledge despite passing nursing courses, lack of motivation to prepare for the exam, overwhelming stress, poor test-taking skills, and lack of confidence. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that students' self-perceptions of poor test-taking skills had a significant negative effect on HESI exit exam scores. These findings were used to design a project focused on teaching test-taking skills throughout the nursing program. The study and project collectively promote positive social change by providing a means to improve nursing program graduation rates, a tool of great importance in addressing the current shortage of nurses in the United States' workforce.

The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test.     The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process.     The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

T1  - Statistical Methods in Genetic Association Studies and a Genetic Risk Score for Predictive Modeling of Disease Risk: from Gene Discovery to Translation
AN  - 1554331595
AB  - Fueled by rapid technological and methodological development, research in the area of genetic epidemiology has brought many successes as well as analytical challenges in identification of genetic risk factors for disease risk. Many have predicted that the detection of heritable disease susceptibility variants could eventually lead to stable models for prediction of disease risk. This dissertation is devoted to the statistical methodological consideration and development in genetic association studies, as well as the use of weighted genetic risk score in predictive modeling of disease risk.   We begin the work by reviewing a brief background into genetic association studies, predictive modeling and relevant analytic challenges. In Chapter 2, we discuss the theoretical relationship between classical multiple linear regression (MLR) and two-stage residual-outcome regression analysis (2SR) in terms of confounding adjustment. We demonstrate that the 2SR would introduce bias and loss of power in the presence of confounding, and thus remind researchers to be cautious in applying the 2SR in genetic association studies. In Chapter 3, we propose an adaptive permutation procedure in testing the significance of susceptibility genetic variants. Results show that the adaptive test is statistically valid as well as computationally feasible in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recommendations are made for the implementation of adaptive permutation in real studies. In Chapter 4, we develop an explained-variance based genetic risk score (GRS) for predictive modeling of disease risk. Extensive simulation studies suggest that this new weighted GRS is a robust risk score approach that consistently outperforms simple count and odds ratio based GRS approaches. In Chapter 5, we further explore the performance of GRS approaches in the presence of interactions, including statistical interaction, dependence and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results emphasize the advantage of weighted GRS even in more complicated settings, motivating its application in predictive modeling. This work concludes with several practical guidelines in genetic association studies and predictive modeling, and discussions of future perspectives.

T1  - Employing Online S-P Diagnostic Table for Qualitative Comments on Test Results
AN  - 1509087439; EJ1016233
AB  - The major concerns of adaptive testing studies have concentrated on effectiveness and efficiency of the system built for the research experiments. It has been criticised that such general information has fallen short of providing qualitative descriptions regarding learning performance. Takahiro Sato of Japan proposed an analytical diagram called Student-Problem Chart (S-P Chart) in the 1970. The S-P Chart is able to establish a learning diagnostic table which comments student learning performance in a verbal form. The advancement of computer technology has made the S-P analytical process more applicable for school teachers. This study examined how online comments provided by the S-P diagnostic table could affect the students' learning attitude. One hundred sixth grade students were selected to be the subjects of the study. An online embedded test was given to the subjects and an S-P diagnostic table was drawn by the computer to display instant comments on each student's learning performance. A Questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews were performed after the experiment. Results indicated that students liked the online qualitative comments. This is because students were able to instantly understand why they performed well/poor in the test, which is much beyond the numerical scores can explain. The results also showed that the online S-P diagnostic table made students more circumspect on answering the test questions in order to reduce careless mistakes. Students would also be more likely to review what they missed on the test. However, the S-P comment table seemed to have no effect on improving their learning performance. An online iterative drilling platform was consequently built to incorporate with the S-P diagnostic process to assist poorly performed students. It may effectively work with the S-P diagnostic process to provide constructive remediation for the students who exhibited a poor performance on the S-P chart.

T1  - A Mixture Rasch Model-Based Computerized Adaptive Test for Latent Class Identification
AN  - 1037907830; EJ974723
AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

T1  - A computerized adaptive version of the SF-36 is feasible for clinic and Internet administration in adults with HIV
AN  - 1023777666
AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N=100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N=101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A New Approach to the Measurement of Adaptive Behavior: Development of the PEDI-CAT for Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 1018479370; EJ964543
AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. (Contains 3 tables.)

T1  - Feedback type as a moderator of the relationship between achievement goals and feedback reactions
AN  - 905711494
AB  - The aim of the current study is to shed new light on the inconsistent relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining feedback type as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by feedback type. Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and feedback type also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used in a wide range of human resource and performance management instruments (e.g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/360° feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees' reactions and rate of performance improvement.

T1  - Potential Impact of Context Effects on the Scoring and Equating of the Multistage GRE® Revised General Test. ETS GRE® Board Research Report. ETS GRE® GREB-08-01. ETS Research Report. RR-11-26
AN  - 1871579900; EJ1110374
AB  - Both theoretical and practical considerations have led the revision of the Graduate Record Examinations® (GRE®) revised General Test, here called the rGRE, to adopt a multistage adaptive design that will be continuously or nearly continuously administered and that can provide immediate score reporting. These circumstances sharply constrain the available options for equating or linking together the thousands of unique test forms that will need to be administered each year. The only practical method is to pre-equate each form through item response theory (IRT) methods. Unfortunately, doing so means that item position and context effects are both vitally important and potentially difficult to control. This study examines item position effects in a GRE context and attempts to assess the extent to which they may affect the rGRE. It was found that position effects are in fact present in GRE data and that they can be particularly troublesome under multistage testing. Pretest strategies are able to mitigate effects to some degree, but complete control will require careful attention be paid to the time limits and associated test configuration details in the design of the rGRE.

T1  - Adaptive Architectures for Robust and Efficient Computing
AN  - 896357604
AB  - Semiconductor technology scaling has long been a source of dramatic gains in our computing capabilities. However, as we test the physical limits of silicon feature size, serious reliability and computational efficiency challenges confront us. The supply voltage levels have practically stagnated, resulting in increasing power densities and operating temperatures. Given that most semiconductor wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Further, the rise in power density is also limiting the number of resources that can be kept active on chip simultaneously, motivating the need for energy-efficient computing.    In this landscape of technological challenges, incremental architectural improvements to existing designs are likely insufficient, motivating a need to rethink the architectural fabric from the ground up. Towards this end, this thesis presents adaptive architecture and compiler solutions that can effectively tackle reliability, performance and energy-efficiency demands expected in future microprocessors.    For the reliability challenge, we present StageNet, a highly reconfigurable multicore architecture that is designed as a network of pipeline stages, rather than isolated cores. The interconnection flexibility in StageNet allows it to adaptively route around defective pieces of a processor, and deliver graceful performance degradation in the face of failures. We further complement the fault isolation ability of StageNet with an adaptive testing framework that significantly reduces the overhead of in-field fault detection.    As a second contribution, we build upon the interconnection flexibility of StageNet to develop a unified performance-reliability solution. This subsequent design, named CoreGenesis, relies on a set of microarchitectural innovations and compiler hints to merge processor cores for a higher single-thread performance. This enables customization of processing ability (narrow or wide-issue pipelines) to the dynamic workload requirements.    In the final work of this thesis, we investigate the sources of computational inefficiency in general purpose processors, and propose a configurable compute engine, named BERET, for substantial energy savings. The insight here is to cut down on the redundant instruction fetch, decode and register file access energy by optimizing the execution of recurring instruction sequences.

T1  - Development of the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument: A Sequential Exploratory Mixed Methods Design
AN  - 1123912459
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that commonly manifests in the feet as pain, swelling and deformity. These symptoms often have extensive and severe mutlidimensional consequences for people's lives and can be evaluated using a class of subjective outcome measures known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs have been advocated by the Darzi report and are central to reforms in the NHS.Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a new and novel PROM, the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument (SAFE), using a clinimetric approach and featuring an adequately pre-tested nomothetic (fixed scale) and idiographic (patient-specific scale) assessment strategy. A mixed methods approach was employed to develop the SAFE, with the formulation and implementation of a four phase sequential exploratory fully mixed methods design (SEMMD) that featured equal priority between the qualitative and quantitative components.The four phase SEMMD enabled the strategic and effective combination of methods to produce a PROM that is firmly rooted in the views and experiences of people with feet affected by RA. The nomothetic scale of the SAFE has evidence for face, content and convergent validity (Spearman-Rank co-efficients: 0.62 - 0.80) and excellent one week test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.86 - 1.00 ). The idiographic scale has evidence for face and content validity.The SAFE is a tool for both clinical practice and clinical research. In order to realise the full potential of the SAFE, further research will be undertaken to refine, develop the PROM and integrate it into clinical practice. Initially, it will be necessary to demonstrate additional measurement properties for the nomothetic scale, including clinical interpretability and responsiveness and also necessary to demonstrate quantitative measurement properties for the idiographic scale. Long term, the SAFE will be redeveloped using item response theory and implemented as a computerised adaptive test.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing, Anxiety Levels, and Gender Differences
AN  - 757171388; EJ896744
AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

T1  - Measuring Social Well-Being in People with Chronic Illness
AN  - 742867924; EJ878855
AB  - Although social well-being (SWB) is recognized as an integral component of health, it is rarely included in health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments. Two SWB dimensions were identified by literature review: social support (SWB-SS) and social function (SWB-SF). As part of a larger project to develop item response theory-derived item banks and computerized adaptive testing, we developed and tested items for the SWB banks. Item ratings of three large (n greater than 600) datasets were conducted by 15 reviewers. Rasch measurement analyses were conducted to initially define item hierarchies. Out of 83 total items, 8 were removed due to model misfit and 8 were removed because of overlapping item content. We then wrote 11 new SWB-SS and 16 new SWB-SF items to fill content gaps, and edited items to improve comprehension and consistency. A total of 94 items (65 SWB-SS, 29 SWB-SF) was administered by computer to 202 cancer patients. Confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch analyses, and evaluations of construct validity were performed. Patients commented favorably on the content of the items and expressed appreciation for attention to this aspect of their HRQL. Using current psychometric standards for unidimensionality, reliability, and content and construct validity, we derived six preliminary item banks for social support (instrumental support, informational support, positive and negative emotional support, positive and negative social companionship) and two for social function (limitations and satisfaction). The empirical construct hierarchy was consistent with clinical observations; e.g., hobbies and leisure activities tended to reflect more limitations, while meeting the needs of family and friends tended to reflect fewer limitations. Optimal care for patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses includes obtaining a complete picture of patients' physical and properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment.psychosocial health status. SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With

We then wrote 11 new SWB-SS and 16 new SWB-SF items to fill content gaps, and edited items to improve comprehension and consistency. A total of 94 items (65 SWB-SS, 29 SWB-SF) was administered by computer to 202 cancer patients. Confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch analyses, and evaluations of construct validity were performed. Patients commented favorably on the content of the items and expressed appreciation for attention to this aspect of their HRQL. Using current psychometric standards for unidimensionality, reliability, and content and construct validity, we derived six preliminary item banks for social support (instrumental support, informational support, positive and negative emotional support, positive and negative social companionship) and two for social function (limitations and satisfaction). The empirical construct hierarchy was consistent with clinical observations; e.g., hobbies and leisure activities tended to reflect more limitations, while meeting the needs of family and friends tended to reflect fewer limitations. Optimal care for patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses includes obtaining a complete picture of patients' physical and psychosocial health status. SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment can affect quality of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Un algorithme d’échantillonnage permettant d’améliorer la performance prédictive d’un modèle bayésien dans le cadre d’applications de tests adaptatifs
AN  - 750964376
AB  - Bayesian graphical models are commonly used to build student models from data. A number of standard algorithms are available to train Bayesian models from student skills assessment data. These models can assess student knowledge and skills from a few observations. They are useful for Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), for example, where the test items can be administered in order to maximize the information they will provide. In practice, such data often contain missing values and, under some circumstances, missing values far outnumber observed values. However, when collecting data from test results, one can often choose which values will be present or missing by a consequent test design. We study how to optimize the choice of test items for collecting the data that will be used for training a Bayesian CAT model, such as to maximize the predictive performance of the model. We explore the use of a simple heuristic for test item choice based on the level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of an item is derived from its initial probability of success and, thus, from its difficulty.    The results show that this choice does affect model performance and that the heuristic can lead to better performance. Although the study’s results are more exploratory than conclusive, they suggest interesting research avenues.

T1  - Impact of item parameter drift on examinee ability measures in a computer adaptive environment
AN  - 750171758
AB  - This dissertation investigated the impact of item parameter drift (IPD) on examinee ability measures, in the analysis of data generated from a computerized adaptive test (CAT) collected in year 2003 by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in a Medical Technologist (MT) examination. For the 2003 ASCP MT exam, the item bank included 1,270 items. Items were selected from seven subscales: (a) blood banking, (b) chemistry, (c) hematology, (d) immunology, (e) laboratory operations, (f) microbiology, and (g) urinalysis. ASCP administered this CAT to 2,555 examinees.    The data were analyzed using a new hierarchical linear model (HLM), called the Rasch longitudinal model (RLM), which models interaction between the item and time, in addition to parameters of examinee ability and item difficulty (easiness). The analysis demonstrated how IPD within the item bank for the ASCP MT exam affected examinee ability measures, and the extent to which IPD altered certification or pass-fail decisions.    The RLM identified items that exhibited significant IPD for each subscale and provided the magnitude (and direction) of IPD within the 2003 ASCP MT exam data. No one subscale was more sensitive to IPD than any other. Further, by including significant time effects (IPD), the RLM provided a better fit to the data than the Rasch model as an HLM. The RLM not only determined items exhibiting IPD but also compensated for the existence of IPD within the calculation of examinee abilities by using the drifted item difficulty value versus the anchored one. Consequently, the RLM provided more accurate measures of examinee ability and item difficulty than the Rasch model as analyzed using the WINSTEPS program As a result, using the RLM yielded a more efficient IPD detection method, one that identified items with IPD but also corrected the estimation of examinee abilities for the existence of IPD.

T1  - Using real-data simulations to compare computer adaptive testing and static short-form administrations of an upper extremity item bank
AN  - 304874079
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which administers only items relevant to respondents’ ability, has the advantage of measuring persons’ ability precisely with considerably fewer items than traditional tests. CAT has been proposed for use in healthcare to reduce the respondents’, administrators’ or researchers’ burden in clinics/clinical trials. However, there have been few studies in healthcare that have investigated the optimal characteristics of a CAT. The objective of my study was to investigate: (1) the psychometrics of an item bank measuring upper extremity (UE) disorders for CAT use, (2) how different testing procedures affect the ability estimates from CAT, and (3) whether CAT produce better ability estimates than a traditional static short assessment. The psychometrics of the item bank developed by combining items from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Upper Extremity Functional Index were examined by confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis across body part impairments (neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand). Repeated-measures MANOVA was used to investigate the standard error (SE) and bias of ability estimates from CAT with different testing procedures. Structural equation modeling was implemented to examine the correlations between ability estimates from the full test and different CAT structures and the full test with a short form. Further, paired-sample t test was performed to investigate the SE and bias of ability estimates from CAT and a static short form. In general, the item bank was found essentially unidimensional, the generalized partial credit model fit to the data better than partial credit model and there was no significant DIF. The ability estimates from CAT with expected a posteriori ability estimation method was found to be more precise and more comparable to those from full test than ability estimates derived from the maximum likelihood estimation. Further, CAT had better precision, comparability to full test and sensitivity to detect change than a static short form. The findings from this study suggest that UE CAT differ across estimations methods and are significantly better than a short form version.

T1  - Relationships between NWEA -MAP score information and teachers' efficacy beliefs for student performance on the North Dakota State Assessment
AN  - 304845516
AB  - In the current environment of federally mandated high-stakes testing, teachers and schools are under great pressure to ensure that students demonstrate proficiency on state assessments. Without formative feedback that connects what a teacher did in the classroom with positive outcomes on the state assessment, a teacher may not feel that he or she can make a difference in how students fare on the state assessment. Teachers who experience low self-efficacy use less effective teaching techniques, and this affects student learning.    Many schools are now using computer adaptive testing, such as the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA-MAP), to provide teachers with formative information to use for instructional improvement. When adjustments to instruction result in higher student achievement, it can provide the teacher with mastery experiences that increase the teacher's efficacy perceptions.    The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teachers' efficacy beliefs for making a difference in their students' performances on the state assessment and teachers' uses of NWEA-MAP test results. Teachers were surveyed using four measures of teacher efficacy and collective teacher efficacy. Two measures that were created for this study demonstrated high reliability with the study sample and correlated well with the two existing scales. Data were also collected on the ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information and the number of different ways they used score information.    The results indicated that the number of ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information made a significant difference in teachers' scores on the efficacy measures: Using score information in three or four different ways was associated with the highest scores on the efficacy scales. Also, using test score information to set goals with students and to individualize instruction predicted teachers' efficacy scores to a greater degree than did using scores to adjust curriculum and instruction.    The current study, with its two new measures and its suggestions of relationships between variables, provides a starting point for new lines of research in sources of teacher efficacy beliefs.

T1  - Computerized adaptive test item response times for correct and incorrect pretest and operational items: Testing fairness and test -taking strategies
AN  - 304842739
AB  - This study examined the amount of time spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items.    Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels.    A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners’ manual.

T1  - Impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification on ability estimation in computerized adaptive sequential testing (CAST)
AN  - 305322722
AB  - Computer Adaptive Sequential Testing (CAST) is a test delivery model that combines features of the traditional conventional paper-and-pencil testing and item-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The basic structure of CAST is a panel composed of multiple testlets adaptively administered to examinees at different stages. Current applications of CAST reply on the item response theory (IRT) and assume a unidimensional IRT model for scoring.    This study evaluated the robustness of CAST when tests were constructed, administered, and scored by a unidimensional IRT model but item responses were multidimensional. Various conditions of multidimensionality were simulated in item pools, as well as different levels of content misclassification through manipulation of the correspondence between content area and dimension of items. An automated test assembly (ATA) process constructed CAST panels from the item pools, each representing a unique combination of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Administration of the panels was simulated and multidimensional response data were scored by the unidimensional IRT model. The ability scores, routing decisions, and pass-fail decisions were evaluated against "true" ability scores and decisions to assess the impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification.    Results showed that, when multidimensionality was mild as measured by the angle distance between item clusters, unidimensional ability estimates and routing decisions were not sensitive to the level of content misclassification in item pools. Only when multidimensionality was severe, panels without content misclassification yielded more accurate ability estimates and routing decisions. However, type I errors of pass-fail decisions (defined as passing unqualified examinees) were the smallest for panels without content misclassification, regardless of the severity of multidimensionality. The conclusion was that, although content classification, affecting dimensional structure during test assembly, might not be a serious concern for unidimensional ability estimation and routing decisions for CAST with multidimensional data, it played a significant role in the accuracy of pass-fail decisions.

T1  - Computerized adaptive testing and the experience of flow in examinees
AN  - 305308795
AB  - In recent years, comparisons between computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and paper-and-pencil tests (P&Ps) have focused less on equivalency and more on the construct validity of shifting between the modalities. Examinee motivation is one area of concern, including test and computer anxiety. One type of motivation, flow, has a characteristic pattern of development similar to the pattern of item selection in CAT. Flow theory posits that positive reinforcement is gained through the sensation of achieving optimal performance. This study attempts to determine whether CAT facilitates flow in examinees, enabling them to perform better than on P&Ps. Covariates like test and computer anxiety, academic achievement, and certain personality traits are taken into account. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 94 middle-school CAT examinees to 65 middle-school P&P examinees on their responses to the Flow State Scale 2 (FSS-2), and regression modeling revealed a significant interaction between test modality and test anxiety on state flow, and significant effects for trait flow, typical study time, gender, and ethnicity when controlling for other covariates. Significant effects on specific flow dimensions were also found. The effect of flow on test performance was examined, but may have been limited by sample size. Reliability and dimensionality was confirmed for several instruments, some for the first time with an adolescent population: FSS-2, the Dispositional Flow Scale 2, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Test Anxiety Inventory-Short Form, and the Computer Attitude Scale. Interviews with students were also conducted to confirm the validity of measuring flow in testing situations. Implications of the results are discussed.

T1  - On the beat: Human movement and timing in the production and perception of music
AN  - 305378616
AB  - This thesis addresses three aspects of movement, performance and perception in music performance. First, the playing of an accent, a simple but much used and practiced element in drumming is studied, second, the perception of gradually changing tempo, and third, the perception and communication of specific emotional intentions through movements during music performance.    Papers I and II investigated the execution and interpretation of an accent in drumming, performed under different playing conditions. Players' movements, striking velocities and timing patterns were studied for different tempi, dynamic levels and striking surfaces. It was found that the players used differing movement strategies and that interpreted the accent differently, reflected in their movement trajectories. Strokes at higher dynamic levels were played from a greater average height and with higher striking velocities. All players initiated the accented strokes from a greater height, and delivered the accent with increased striking velocity compared to the unaccented strokes. The interval beginning with the accented stroke was also prolonged, generally by delaying the following stroke. Recurrent cyclic patterns were found in the players' timing performances. In a listening test, listeners perceived grouping of the strokes according to the cyclic patterns.    Paper III concerned the perception of gradual tempo changes in auditory sequences. Using an adaptive test procedure subjects judged stimuli consisting of click sequences with either increasing or decreasing tempo, respectively. Each experiment included three test sessions at different nominal tempi (80, 120, and 180 beats per minute). The results showed that ten of the eleven subjects showed an inherent bias in their perception of tempo drift. The direction and magnitude of the bias was consistent between test sessions but varied between individuals. The just noticeable differences for tempo drift agreed well with the estimated tempo drifts in production data, but were much smaller than earlier reported thresholds for tempo drift.    Paper IV studied how emotional intent in music performances is conveyed to observers through the movements of the musicians. Three players of marimba, bassoon, and saxophone respectively, were filmed when playing with the expressive intentions Happiness, Sadness, Anger and Fear. Observers rated the emotional content and movement cues in the videos clips shown without sound. The results showed that the observers were able to identify the intentions Sadness, Anger, and Happiness, but not Fear. The rated movement cues showed that an Angry performance was characterized by jerky movements, Happy performances by large, and somewhat fast and jerky movements, and Sad performances by slow, and smooth movements.

T1  - Constructing Rotating Item Pools for Constrained Adaptive Testing: Journal of Educational Measurement
AN  - 197414203
AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

T1  - A calibration of the McGill Pain Questionnaire -Short Form: Using item response theory
AN  - 305195281
AB  - The McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ - SF) is a measure of pain published in 1987. This dissertation conducts a confirmatory factor analysis of the measure's structure, as well as a calibration of the items on the measure, using Item Response Theory. A total of 1185 patients reporting to two chronic pain care treatment centers completed the MPQ - SF in the course of their admission to treatment. Factor analyses of their data suggests a three-factor solution of “acute,” “emotional,” and “soreness” factors led to a higher order factor of “pain.” This solution provides an adequate fit for the data. Previously published one and two factor structures did not demonstrate adequate fit in this data set. Unidimensionality in this sample was supported by the presence of a higher order factor of “Pain.” Items on the measure are calibrated using the two-parameter logistic model. Specifically, item slope and location parameters are calculated for each of the items, and differential item functioning is investigated between four subgroups of data. Performance on the items was contrasted between subgroups differing on gender, pain diagnosis, workers' compensation status and pain coping status using Raju's DFIT methodology. No differential test functioning was found; however, some individual items did display differential item functioning by subgroup. Sample characteristics that contribute to differential item functioning are examined further. Additionally, implications for diagnostic considerations and computer adaptive testing are discussed.

T1  - Evaluating the effects of several multi -stage testing design variables on selected psychometric outcomes for certification and licensure assessment
AN  - 305176302
AB  - Computer-based testing is becoming popular with credentialing agencies because new test designs are possible and the evidence is clear that these new designs can increase the reliability and validity of candidate scores and pass/fail decisions. Research on MST to date suggests that the measurement quality of MST results is comparable to full-fledged computer-adaptive tests and improved over computerized fixed-form tests. MST's promise dwells in this potential for improved measurement with greater control than other adaptive approaches for constructing test forms.    Recommending use of the MST design and advising how best to set up the design, however, are two different things. The purpose of the current simulation study was to advance an established line of research on MST methodology by enhancing understanding of how several important design variables affect outcomes for high-stakes credentialing.   Modeling of the item bank, the candidate population, and the statistical characteristics of test items reflect an operational credentialing exam's conditions. Studied variables were module arrangement (4 designs), amount of overall test information (4 levels), distribution of information over stages (2 variations), strategies for between-stage routing (4 levels), and pass rates (3 levels), for 384 conditions total.   Results showed that high levels of decision accuracy (DA) and decision consistency (DC) were consistently observed, even when test information was reduced by as much as 25%. No differences due to the choice of module arrangement were found. With high overall test information, results were optimal when test information was divided equally among stages; with reduced test information gathering more test information at Stage 1 provided the best results.    Generalizing simulation study findings is always problematic. In practice, psychometric models never completely explain candidate performance, and with MST, there is always the potential psychological impact on candidates if test difficulty shifts are noticed. At the same time, two findings seem to stand out in this research: (1) with limited amounts of overall test information, it may be best to capitalize on available information with accurate branching decisions early, and (2) there may be little statistical advantage in exceeding test information much above 10 as gains in reliability and validity appear minimal.

T1  - Statistical detection and estimation of differential item functioning in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 305338294
AB  - Differential item functioning (DIF) is an important issue in large scale standardized testing. DIF refers to the unexpected difference in item performances among groups of equally proficient examinees, usually classified by ethnicity or gender. Its presence could seriously affect the validity of inferences drawn from a test. Various statistical methods have been proposed to detect and estimate DIF.    This dissertation addresses DIF analysis in the context of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whose item selection algorithm adapts to the ability level of each individual examinee. In a CAT, a DIF item may be more consequential and more detrimental be cause fewer items are administered in a CAT than in a traditional paper-and-pencil test and because the remaining sequence of items presented to examinees depends in part on their responses to the DIF item. Consequently, an efficient, stable and flexible method to detect and estimate CAT DIF becomes necessary and increasingly important.    We propose simultaneous implementations of online calibration and DIF testing. The idea is to perform online calibration of an item of interest separately in the focal and reference groups. Under any specific parametric IRT model, we can use the (online) estimated latent traits as covariates and fit a nonlinear regression model to each of the two groups. Because of the use of the estimated, not the true &thetas;, the regression fit has to adjust for the covariate “measurement errors”. It turns out that this situation fits nicely into the framework of nonlinear error-in-variable modelling, which has been extensively studied in statistical literature.    We develop two bias-correction methods using asymptotic expansion and conditional score theory. After correcting the bias caused by measurement error, one can perform a significance test to detect DIF with the parameter estimates for different groups. This dissertation also discusses some general techniques to handle measurement error modelling with different IRT models, including the three-parameter normal ogive model and polytomous response models. Several methods of estimating DIF are studied as well.    Large sample properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies show that the resulting methods perform well in terms of Type-I error rate control, accuracy in estimating DIF and power against both unidirectional and crossing DIF.

T1  - The implications of the use of non -optimal items in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment
AN  - 276279115
AB  - This study describes the effects of manipulating item difficulty in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment. There are many potential benefits when using CATS as compared to traditional tests. These include increased security, shorter tests, and more precise measurement. According to IRT, the theory underlying CAT, as the computer continually recalculates ability, items that match that current estimate of ability are administered. Such items provide maximum information about examinees during the test. Herein, however, lies a potential problem. These optimal CAT items result in an examinee having only a 50% chance of a correct response. Some examinees may consider such items unduly challenging. Further, when test anxiety is a factor, it is possible that test scores may be negatively affected.    This research was undertaken to determine the effects of administering easier CAT items on ability estimation and test length using computer simulations. Also considered was the administration of different numbers of initial items prior to the start of the adaptive portion of the test, using three different levels of measurement precision.    Results indicate that regardless of the number of initial items administered, the level of precision employed, or the modifications made to item difficulty, the approximation of estimated ability to true ability is good in all cases. Additionally, the standard deviations of the ability estimates closely approximate the theoretical levels of precision used as stopping rules for the simulated CATs.    Since optimal CAT items are not used, each item administered provides less information about examinees than optimal CAT items. This results in longer tests. Fortunately, using easier items that provide up to a 66.4% chance of a correct response results in tests that only modestly increase in length, across levels of precision. For larger standard errors, even easier items (up to a 73.5% chance of a correct response) result in only negligible to modest increases in test length.    Examinees who find optimal CAT items difficult or examinees with test anxiety may find CATs that implement easier items enhance the already existing benefits of CAT.

T1  - Effects of Changes in the Examinees' Ability Distribution on the Exposure Control Methods in CAT
AN  - 62355853; ED453228
AB  - To satisfy the security requirements of computerized adaptive tests (CATs), efforts have been made to control the exposure rates of optimal items directly by incorporating statistical methods into the item selection procedure. Since differences are likely to occur between the exposure control parameter derivation stage and the operational CAT administrations, the exposure control methods may not fully accomplish the goal of controlling item exposure. This study explored the effects of the distribution changes on the performance of the Sympson and Hetter (SH) (J. Sympson and R. Hetter, 1985) and the Davey and Parshall (DP) (T. Davey and C. Parshall, 1995) procedures and provided an examination of the assertion that the Stocking and Lewis (M. Stocking and C. Lewis, 1998) conditional multinomial (SLC) procedure would function independently of an real examinee population. Simulations were carried out for this study using various combinations of the intended and real ability distributions. The results show that the changes in the examinees' ability distribution affected both SH and DP procedures in their control of the observed maximum exposure rates, and the effects were more profound for the SH method. The performance of the SLC method was demonstrated to be independent of the examinee's ability distributions in the operational CAT administrations. Contains 19 references, 5 tables, and 4 figures.

T1  - Computerized -adaptive versus paper -and -pencil testing environments: An experimental analysis of examinee experience
AN  - 250988108
AB  - Computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) is quickly becoming the test mode of choice among many high-stakes testing agencies. Although some researchers suggest that CAT is comparable, if not better, than traditional paper-and-pencil testing, others have suggested that individual differences among examinees have not been fully explored. In particular, the additional cognitive demands imposed by CAT are not well understood. For example, in the CAT mode there is the added demand of moving back and forth from computer screen to scrap paper when one has to solve more complex problems. In traditional paper and-pencil (P&P) testing environments, there is but one mode with which to contend: paper-and-pencil. In addition, CAT may generate greater anxiety—which further increases cognitive load—among some test-takers than would be found with more traditional testing modes. For example, with CAT you cannot go back to review previous items or change previous answers. And CAT requires something that is anxiety provoking in and of itself for some individuals: use of a computer.    The purpose of this study was to explore the effects, particularly the cognitive effects, of different testing environments on individual test-taker experience. Forty undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions: CAT mode or P&P testing mode. All subjects took the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination. Methodology for the study included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil instruments, videotaped recording of subject behavior, observation, and interview. Verbal protocol analysis of subsamples of subjects' work-toward-solution behavior on two analytical reasoning problems was also included.    Results of multivariate and univariate analyses suggest significant differences across test mode, with respect to cognitive demands. Compared to subjects in the paper-and-pencil test mode, CAT subjects had significantly longer response times on analytical reasoning (AR) problems, relied more on scrap paper to model AR problems diagrammatically, and employed different problem-solving strategies. Differences in affective responses—including anxiety and frustration—further suggest test mode effects were present. CAT subjects expressed significantly more frustration with the test mode than did their P&P counterparts. Furthermore, CAT subjects with low computer confidence experienced significantly higher levels of test anxiety than did their more computer-confident peers. Implications for test developers and recommendations for further research are offered.

T1  - A ‘rearrangement procedure’ for administering adaptive tests when review options are permitted
AN  - 250951635
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained increased popularity during the last decades. Consequently, admissions tests such as the GRE, the TOEFL, as well as other certification and licensure exams have been transformed from their paper-and-pencil versions to computerized adaptive versions. However, a major difference between the two test formats, from an examinee's point of view, is that examinees are usually not allowed to revise their answers on CATs. Some researchers feel that the validity of a CAT can increase with item review, since it allows them to rethink their answers and make corrections to items that have been misread or miskeyed. Other researchers believe that item review can decrease the efficiency and validity of a CAT since item review allows examinees to cheat on the test.    The purpose of this study was to test the efficiency of a ‘ rearrangement procedure’ that rearranges and skips certain items in order to better estimate the examinees' abilities. This was examined through a simulation study. This rearrangement procedure permits examinees to change their answers on a CAT without allowing them to artificially inflate their test scores. If this procedure were adopted, it could help reduce the stress of examinees who feel that they have more control over the testing situation when they can revise their answers. This procedure could also help improve the reliability and validity of the CAT since errors due to misread and miskeyed answers would be corrected.    The results of this simulation study have shown that when the Maximum Likelihood estimation was used, the rearrangement procedure was effective in reducing the bias of the ability estimates. With the Bayesian estimation, the rearrangement procedure increased the reliability, and slightly decreased the standard error of the estimates. However, the Bayesian method was not effective in reducing the bias of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure.    There were not many differences in the accuracy of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure, when three or five items were reviewed. There were also very small differences in the effects that the item pool size had on the accuracy of the ability estimates after the rearrangement procedure.

T1  - Applicant reactions to novel selection tools
AN  - 304615853
AB  - Organizations are increasingly using novel tools (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in designing selection systems. While there is great interest in using these tools, there is little research to indicate how applicants react to them. As applicant reactions have been shown to affect a number of variables important to organizations (e.g., test fairness, job acceptance, productivity, recommendation intentions), it is important to understand what determines these reactions. A framework was developed to highlight a number of antecedents to, types of, and consequences of reactions to novel testing. The current study has a 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil - computerized) x 2 (perceived technical level of the job: high technical job - low technical job) x 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design. While test-takers' post-test perceptions do not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, factors such as computer anxiety and experience were shown to be important factors in determining success in the selection process. Results show the significant relationships between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing novel selection tools in an applicant setting.

T1  - Impact of Local Item Dependence on Item Response Theory Scoring in CAT. Law School Admission Council Computerized Testing Report. LSAC Research Report Series
AN  - 62188696; ED467817
AB  - This study represented a first attempt to evaluate the impact of local item dependence (LID) for Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The most basic CAT design and a simplified design for simulating CAT item pools with varying degrees of LID were applied. A data generation method that allows the LID among items to be defined was applied to generate five CAT item pools. The LID exhibited by these pools ranged from zero LID (complete local item independence) to extreme LID. Results indicate that for certain types of scoring an extreme amount of LID may adversely impact the final score obtained by the examinee. The estimated precision of the test was also affected by the extreme LID level studied here. For the medium level of LID, structured to display the amount of LID typically displayed by the Law School Admission Test, the effects of the LID were not troublesome.

T1  - The development of a computerized version of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the effect of visuo -spatial working memory loading
AN  - 304522650
AB  - This dissertation focused on the generation and evaluation of web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Memory and spatial visualization theory were explored in relation to the addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component.    Analysis of the data determined that there was a significant difference between scores on the MRT Computer and MRT Memory test. The addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component did significantly affect results at the .05 alpha level. Reliability and discrimination estimates were higher on the MRT Memory version. The computerization of the paper and pencil version on the MRT did not significantly effect scores but did effect the time required to complete the test.    The population utilized in the quasi-experiment consisted of 107 university students from eight institutions in engineering graphics related courses. The subjects completed two researcher developed, Web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the original paper and pencil version of the Mental Rotation Test. One version of the test included a visuo-spatial working memory loading.    Significant contributions of this study included developing and evaluating computerized versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Previous versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test did not take advantage of the ability of the computer to incorporate an interaction factor, such as a visuo-spatial working memory loading, into the test. The addition of an interaction factor results in a more discriminate test which will lend itself well to computerized adaptive testing practices.    Educators in engineering graphics related disciplines should strongly consider the use of spatial visualization tests to aid in establishing the effects of modern computer systems on fundamental design/drafting skills. Regular testing of spatial visualization skills will result assist in the creation of a more relevant curriculum. Computerized tests which are valid and reliable will assist in making this task feasible.

T1  - Simulating Nonmodel-Fitting Responses in a CAT Environment. ACT Research Report Series 98-10
AN  - 62483487; ED427042
AB  - This study developed a model to simulate nonmodel-fitting responses in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment, and to examine the effectiveness of the model. The underlying idea was to simulate examinees' test behaviors realistically. This study simulated a situation in which examinees are exposed to or are coached on test items before actual testing. The multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) (M. Reckase, 1985) model was adopted for this study. Test characteristic curves and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were investigated. The results indicate that the probability of an examinee responding to an item correctly and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were influenced by the severity and the number of affected items. The results also suggest that the proposed model might be an effective tool for investigating the issue of nonmodel-fitting responses in a CAT environment. (Contains 7 figures and 39 references.)

T1  - A study of two computerized adaptive tests within an item response theory framework
AN  - 304433174
AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an item response theory (IRT). Additionally this study examined the effect of repeated practice with ACCUPLACER on subsequent ACCUPLACER and COMPASS scores. General opinions of students toward ACCUPLACER and COMPASS and correlations between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and paper-and-pencil (P&P) formats were investigated.    Methods. The investigator sampled 517 ACCUPLACER tests in order to develop a large number of response patterns and scores. This data source was used to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers and consistency between item response patterns and test scores in ACCUPLACER. This study employed seven classes of developmental mathematics; specifically, three classes were the experimental group and four classes comprised the control group. As treatment, students from the experimental group practiced the ACCUPLACER four times during the quarter. Students from all seven classes took the preACCUPLACER, postACCUPLACER, preCOMPANION, postCOMPANION, postCOMPASS, and Developmental Final Examinations. All students responded to the Opinionnaires of the ACCUPLACER and COMPASS. Scores on SAT-Math, SAT-Verbal, and Collegiate Placement Examination were obtained from students' records.    Results. Test questions generated from all correct responses and test questions generated from all incorrect responses were disjoint. Starter questions were found to be moderately easy rather than average difficulty. Six of the twelve items were identical and appeared in the same position on many initially correct response patterns. Lower scores came from initially incorrect response patterns. Scores varied greatly within the same response pattern when different sequences of items were given. A total of 108 different items were found, not the expected 214 items. Several starter questions appeared as later items in tests with primarily incorrect responses. Some correlations between CAT and P&P formats were significant $(p < .05).$ Students found that instructions and graphics were unclear on CATs.    Conclusions. The results of this study are not consistent with five of the purported claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an IRT framework. Several sets of scores within the same response pattern widely varied. Repeated practice on a CAT did not affect subsequent CAT scores. Correlations between CAT and P&P formats indicate that one format of testing is not a good predictor of the other form of testing. Remedial students find CATs difficult to understand.

T1  - A comparative study of item exposure control methods in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 304414840
AB  - This study investigated and compared the properties of five methods of item exposure control within the purview of estimating examinees' abilities in a CAT context. Simulations were used to carry out this research. The item pools were constructed based on item parameters calibrated from the existing paper-and-pencil ACT Assessment Mathematics Test. Each of the exposure control algorithms was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed according to the CAT design established for this study. The merits and shortcomings of these strategies were considered under two item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of item security, test overlap rates, pool utilization, and the conditional standard errors of measurement, bias, and root mean squared errors.    The general observations revealed that the randomization technique did not better ensure item security to any noticeable extent than the procedure without exposure control. The Sympson and Hetter and the Stocking and Lewis unconditional multinomial procedures produced very similar results under all conditions. However, when developing the exposure control parameters, the Sympson and Hetter method was much more efficient. The results yielded by the Davey and Parshall procedure were in general favorable. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates, but this came at the price of decreases in precision due to the strict control of item exposure.    The performance of the various methods was affected differentially by the size of the item pool. Also, the comparative properties of the various methods were not consistent under the two desired exposure rate conditions. These differential effects might be attributed to the specific features of the algorithms in combination with the structure of the item pool.    Each method had its advantages and disadvantages, but none possessed all desired characteristics. There was a clear and logical trade-off between exposure control and measurement precision. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure, and to a slightly lesser extent, the Davey and Parshall method seemed to be the most promising considering all factors this study addressed.

T1  - Overview of Practical Issues in a CAT Program
AN  - 62624506; ED408330
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

T1  - Examinee Issues in CAT
AN  - 62603310; ED408329
AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

T1  - An investigation of selected variables to predict student performance on the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) in one baccalaureate degree nursing program
AN  - 304377477
AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well academic, demographic, and programmatic variables could explain and predict variation in graduate performance on NCLEX-RN in one baccalaureate nursing program. The study specifically sought to address the void in empirical research in the area of programmatic variables predictive of NCLEX-RN performance. The study also investigated whether the changes made in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to computer adaptive testing (CAT), which was initiated in 1994, could help explain variations experience in program pass rate between 1990 and 1996.    The population was composed of 360 May and June graduates from one baccalaureate nursing program. The research method used in this study was an archival survey.    Analysis of t-tests and z-tests showed that the two outcome groups (pass group and fail group) differed significantly (p $<$.05) in terms of gender and ethnicity. Moreover, the two groups differed significantly in terms of many academic variables (ACT Composite score; admission, freshman, sophomore, junior, cumulative, nursing and science GPA's; and number of nursing and support courses repeated). In the final logistic regression model, four of the independent variables; gender (SEX), nursing GPA, number of nursing and support courses repeated (REPEAT), and the mean educational level of the clinical nursing faculty (C-ED), were found to be significant predictors of NCLEX-RN performance (p $<$.05; one-tailed probability). The author concluded that male and minority students, and student who have repeated nursing and support courses, are at risk for failure on NCLEX-RN. Additionally, because the education of the clinical faculty proved to affect graduate odds for success on NCLEX-RN, it was recommended that programs strive to attract, recruit, and retain highly qualified clinical faculty.    When added to the regression equation, the version of the NCLEX-RN did not prove to be statistically significant. The researcher concluded, therefore, that the change in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to CAT did not contribute to the variations in the NCLEX-RN pass rate experienced by this nursing program.

T1  - Accuracy of parameter estimation on polytomous IRT models
AN  - 304356874
AB  - Procedures based on item response theory (IRT) are widely accepted for solving various measurement problems which cannot be solved using classical test theory (CTT) procedures. The desirable features of dichotomous IRT models over CTT are well known and have been documented by Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991). However, dichotomous IRT models are inappropriate for situations where items need to be scored in more than two categories. For example, in performance assessments, most of the scoring rubrics for performance assessment require scoring of examinee's responses in ordered categories. In addition, polytomous IRT models are useful for assessing an examinee's partial knowledge or levels of mastery. However, the successful application of polytomous IRT models to practical situations depends on the availability of reasonable and well-behaved estimates of the parameters of the models. Therefore, in this study, the behavior of estimators of parameters in polytomous IRT models were examined.    In the first study, factors that affected the accuracy, variance, and bias of the marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimators in the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) were investigated. Overall, the results of the study showed that the MML estimators of the parameters of the GPCM, as obtained through the computer program, PARSCALE, performed well under various conditions. However, there was considerable bias in the estimates of the category parameters under all conditions investigated. The average bias did not decrease when sample size and test length increased. The bias contributed to large RMSE in the estimation of category parameters. Further studies need to be conducted to study the effect of bias in the estimates of parameters on the estimation of ability, the development of item banks, and on adaptive testing based on polytomous IRT models.    In the second study, the effectiveness of Bayesian procedures for estimating parameters in the GPCM was examined. The results showed that Bayes procedures provided more accurate estimates of parameters with small data sets. Priors on the slope parameters, while having only a modest effect on the accuracy of estimation of slope parameters, had a very positive effect on the accuracy of estimation of the step difficulty parameters.

T1  - A Critical Analysis of the Arguments for and against Item Review in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62583642; ED400267
AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT.

T1  - The effects of person misfit in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 304265537
AB  - In the past several years many statistical indices have been developed that attempt to quantify the extent to which responses to questions on a test fit the underlying test model. This area of research is commonly referred to as person fit.    Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a test administration procedure in which questions are selected from a pool of available questions depending on how an examinee has responded to previous test questions. Thus, within the CAT environment each examinee is administered a tailored or dynamic test that is unique compared to other examinees' tests.    Previous researchers have not investigated the issue of person fit within the context of CAT. The present study was a monte carlo investigation that simulated nonmodel-fitting responses within the CAT environment under a variety of conditions. The independent variables in this investigation were (1) the number of nonmodel-fitting responses, (2) the location of the nonmodel-fitting responses, (3) the point in the CAT process at which testing terminated, and (4) the entry point used for the CAT. The dependent variables were (1) the number of questions administered, (2) accuracy of the estimates of examinees' location on the latent trait ability continuum ($\theta$), (3) each examinee's fit to the underlying model using the $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices, and (4) the distribution of $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices within the CAT environment.    It was found that when several nonmodel-fitting responses occurred early in the CAT procedure (i.e., warm-up effect) the recovery of $\theta$ was very poor. When a warm-up effect was simulated, not only did test length increase but also more examinees were identified as not fitting the model. Using a standard error of less than.20 to terminate the CAT resulted in estimated $\theta$ values that were biased and poorly estimated. Finally, the entry point used in the CAT administration did not seem to affect final ability estimates.    Future research should consider developing new indices to quantify the extent to which examinees fit the test model within the CAT environment, and new methods of simulated nonmodel-fitting response patterns within CAT.

T1  - The Estimation of Item Difficulty from Restricted CAT Calibration Samples
AN  - 62632850; ED386466
AB  - Whether the presence of bidimensionality has any effect on the adaptive recalibration of test items was studied through live-data simulation of computer adaptive testing (CAT) forms. The source data were examinee responses to the 298 scored multiple choice items of a licensure examination in a health care profession. Three 75-item part-forms, differing in the degree of bidimensionality, were constructed from the examination forms. The dimensionality of each item was determined based on principal factor loadings using W. F. Stout's (1987) procedure. Samples of 2,100 examinees from an U.S.-educated group and a predominantly foreign-educated group were used, with samples sizes of 100, 200, 400, and 1,000 used for the analyses. As expected, an increase in sample size resulted in greater agreement between calibration and bank b-values. It appeared that dimensionality affected adaptive recalibration. Results from this study varied depending on the dimensionality of the part-forms. Results also affirm the importance of a well-defined reference group for recalibration, since samples from varying ability ranges sometimes produced considerably different b-values. Three tables present details of the analyses. (Contains six references.) (SLD)

T1  - Practical Design and Implementation Considerations of a Computer Adaptive Foreign Language Test: The Monash/Melbourne French CAT
AN  - 750312360
AB  - While the psychometric and statistical models underlying the design of computer adaptive tests (CAT) are well understood, relatively few working models exist for the purpose of foreign language assessment. Likewise, little has been published concerning the practical considerations affecting the implementation of such tests. in the process of constructing the Monash/Melbourne French CAT, we discovered much about putting testing theory into practice. The present paper reports this experience in three parts. In a preliminary section, we describe the academic context in which the French CAT was created and trialed. This is followed by a detailed consideration of the test presentation platform and operating algorithms. Lastly, we give an evaluation of the first administration of the French CAT, accompanied by a discussion of the test's reliability and validity as a placement instrument for first year Australian university students.

T1  - The Relationships between Individual Difference Variables and Test Performance in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62742305; ED382623
AB  - The relationship between several individual difference variables and test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was studied with 208 South Korean college students. The general individual difference variable selected was test anxiety, and the math-related individual difference variables were mathematics aptitude, math test anxiety, and math self-concept. Computer-related individual difference variables were computer literacy, computer anxiety, and computer experience. The CAT was an algebra test. Test anxiety and other individual difference variables were measured with instruments translated into Korean for the study. The seven difference variables and their squares were submitted to an analysis using the RSQUARE Procedure from Statistical Analysis System software. Math aptitude, math self-concept, math test anxiety, and computer literacy, in that order, were significantly related to test performance using CAT, but test anxiety, computer experience, and computer anxiety were not. Results suggest that the relationship between individual difference variables and test performance using CAT may be curvilinear. Two tables present analysis results. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing Exploring Examinee Response Time Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling
AN  - 62566300; ED400287
AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

T1  - Technological Applications in Science Assessment
AN  - 62779434; ED361207
AB  - Educational technology has been a focus of development and research in science teaching and learning. This document reviews research dealing with computer and hypermedia applications to assessment in science education. The paper reports the findings first for computer applications for assessment and then for hypermedia applications in assessment. Computer applications include access to large test banks, evaluation of student data collected in laboratory exercises, microcomputer-administered diagnostic testing, effects of computer use on student motivation during computer-administered tests, and computerized adaptive testing. Hypermedia applications include interactive videodisc technology for teaching biology, assessing teachers' knowledge for certification purposes, problem-based learning in chemistry found in the "Hyperequation" project, and administering figural response test items to cell and molecular biology students. The summary describes three advantages for incorporating computer-assisted assessment: immediate student feedback, ease of test taking, and availability of another form of formative assessment. Users of computer-assisted assessment are cautioned that computer-generated tests can lull the teacher into simply testing low level recall knowledge, and that the linear nature of computer testing does not allow the student to go back and reflect upon particular items.

T1  - How Review Options and Administration Modes Influence Scores on Computerized Vocabulary Tests
AN  - 62917480; ED346161
AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

T1  - Computer-adaptive versus pencil and paper tests
AN  - 304053062
AB  - This dissertation examined the feasibility of using computer adaptive technology to administer certification examinations. The agenda for this research was (1) to compare a computer adaptive test (CAT) with paper and pencil (PAP) tests in terms of the comparability of item calibrations and the comparability of examinee ability estimates and (2) to examine the CAT under varying test conditions to determine whether modifications in traditional test design affect examinee performance.    Results show that PAP item calibrations were functionally equivalent to the CAT item calibrations even though items on the CAT were administered to varying numbers of examinees and appeared in different contexts for different examinees. Examinees performed comparably on the CAT and the PAP as evidenced by a.83 correlation, adjusted for measurement error, and a mean difference of.01 across the two modes of administration. There were no significant differences between the CAT and the PAP ability estimates due to sex, ethnic origin, age or whether or not English was the examinee's first language.    On the CAT, examinees were randomly placed in test design conditions in which the effects of altering the difficulty of the start, the difficulty of the test, the minimum test length and the option to skip, defer or review items were examined. There were no significant differences in examinee performance across these groups indicating that some of these design options may be viable for CAT.    Test length was reduced on the CAT without sacrificing confidence in the pass/fail decision. Test length on the PAP was 109 items; mean test length on the CAT was 66 items when the maximum test length was set at 100 items and 86 items when the maximum test length was set at 240 items.    Results from this study indicate that CAT can be an excellent way to administer certification exams. Examinees can benefit by being able to take shorter exams, scheduled at their convenience and receive immediate test results. For the certification board, CAT can improve data collection and test security, and provide greater confidence in pass/fail decisions.

T1  - The effect of adaptive testing item selection methods on the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation
AN  - 304000167
AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty.    The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data.    Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

T1  - Linguistic predictors of SAT antonym item difficulty: Identification and employment
AN  - 303987555
AB  - This research investigates the extent to which linguistic features of standardized test antonym items can be used to predict the empirical difficulty of these items. The study was motivated by both theoretical and practical considerations. Theoretically, exploring content-feature correlates of difficulty is a form of construct validation as such inquiry attends to the question of why an item is easy or difficult. The pursuit of evidential links between content and difficulty is a scientific, falsifiable approach to validation. In contrast, conventional response-based analyses do not address the central role played by item content in controlling difficulty. From a practical standpoint, detecting content-based predictors allows for the scaling of similarly constructed items without having to establish difficulty measurements via pretesting.    Twelve variables associated with stem and keyed answer words of 975 published SAT antonym items are considered. Results reveal that the stem word's standard frequency index (SFI) is the most robust predictor of empirical difficulty (as measured by Educational Testing Service's equated delta statistic), distantly followed by the keyed answer word's SFI and part of speech. Across all items, one-third of difficulty variance was explained by this predictor set, confirming the frequency-difficulty relationship reported in studies employing more common words and smaller samples. Prediction was attenuated by the relatively high proportion of words having low frequencies. Presumably, a larger representation of familiar words and more differentiated low frequency values would significantly improve prediction.    These findings suggest that feature-based scaling is an efficient, cost effective means for advancing local development of adaptive assessment systems. A computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system is suggested as one practical, psychometric application of the study's findings. The proposed system would extract verbal stimuli from an electronic word domain and employ the aforementioned word variables as proxies for vocabulary item difficulty. Among the design issues discussed are the automatic construction of vocabulary items, adaptive branching, sequential decision-making, iterative refinement of item calibrations, and the provision of timely output for formative direction of learning and instruction.

T1  - Loudness of quasi-continuous impulse noise
AN  - 303926746
AB  - The loudness of quasi continuous impulse noise has been studied as a function of impulse duration and repetition rate, and the spectral shape and relative level of steady background noise. The measurements were performed on 1-second trains of white-noise bursts with exponentially decaying envelopes. The repetition rates were 5 to 100 Hz. The impulse durations were adjusted so that the duty factor of the impulse train (product of the repetition rate and the effective duration of the impulses) varied from 0.025 to 0.1. Steady white background noise was added at peak-to-background ratios of 10, 20 and 30 dB. The loudness levels of the stimuli relative to a steady white noise reference stimulus at a presentation level of 60.5 dB L$\sb{\rm eq}$ were measured in ten normal-hearing subjects using an adaptive testing procedure.    Under most conditions, the loudness levels of the quasi continuous impulse noise stimuli were best predicted by the equivalent sound pressure level, L$\sb{\rm eq}$, indicating that the "equal energy" relation was followed. At the 50 and 100-Hz repetition rates, the loudness level of the impulse noise test stimuli at the 20 and 30-dB peak-to-background ratios exceeded that of the reference stimulus due to the "roughness effect". The loudness levels of the stimuli at the lower repetition rates, on the other hand, was significantly less than the equal energy prediction at the shortest durations, which suggests that auditory temporal integration depends on the duty factor of the impulse train. The data of experiment 1 were fit by a simple model involving the duty factor of the impulse train and the difference between the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the impulsive component and the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the steady background noise component of the test stimuli.    In the second experiment, the spectral shape of the background noise did not significantly affect the point of subjective equality. However, there was a significant interaction between background noise spectrum and peak-to-background noise ratio which was suggestive of a masking process.

T1  - Investigating Differences in Mean Score on Adaptive and Paper and Pencil Versions of the College Level Academic Skills Reading Test
AN  - 63059154; ED319791
AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

T1  - Test Anxiety and Item Order: New Parameters for Item Response Theory
AN  - 63129829; ED307313
AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

T1  - Work hardening, strength, restorative mechanisms, and ductility in the hot working of 300 series stainless steels
AN  - 303829589
AB  - Stress-strain curves, generated through continuous and multistage torsion tests of as-cast and homogenized 301, 304, 316 and 317 $\gamma$ stainless steels in the range of 1200-900$\sp\circ$C and 0.1 to 5.0 s$\sp{\rm -1}$, were analyzed with respect to the characteristics of work hardening, dynamic and static recovery, dynamic and static recrystallization, and ductility. Work hardening was related to the Kocks-Mecking analysis. The associated enthalpy which rose across the deformation range attaining a maximum at the highest temperature, was in close agreement with the constant activation energy determined by sinh analysis.    Dynamic softening mechanisms were analyzed through examination of the flow curves, with conclusions based upon mechanical data being confirmed by optical metallographic methods. Upon attaining a critical strain, dynamic recrystallization DRX was initiated, producing a peak and then softening to a steady state regime. The rate of dynamic softening was determined by means of the Avrami equation. The critical stress and strain for subgrain formation and for DRX were determined from changes in slope of the strain hardening-flow stress $\theta$-$\sigma$ curves. A transition from multiple peak grain coarsening to single peak grain refinement behavior was observed and analyzed.    Static restorative mechanisms were examined by mechanical metallographic methods. Fractional softening was due to both static recovery SRV and static recrystallization SRX. The kinetics were analyzed through use of the Avrami equation. At low strains, the time for 50% SRX was a strong function of strain to the $-2$ power. In addition, the temperature compensated time for SRX depended upon the three-eights power of the Zener-Hollomon parameter for both isothermal and declining temperature T multistage tests.    Simulation of a cross country mill showed that multistage flow curves increased as strain rate rose and as interval time and T declined, particularly below 1050$\sp\circ$C. Since the time between successive planetary rolls is insufficient for any restorative mechanisms to operate, the instantaneous power requirements for the planetary hot rolling mill were determined from continuous flow curves. The results favorably agreed with similar mills installed in both Canada and Japan.

T1  - Local independence and item context in a simulated adaptive version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
AN  - 303794941
AB  - The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was evaluated for Item Response Theory (IRT) assumptions, local independence and parameter invariance in order to determine the feasibility of developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version. Three conditions were studied including two simulated CAT versions and a standard version (Form R). A sex difference was noted across all groups, but item order did not otherwise affect scores which were highly correlated with the IRT based scores. After excluding those items which did not fit the model, the local independence assumption generally held across groups, and since the procedure used to assess local independence was also sensitive to multidimensionality, this provides implied support for unidimensionality of the various scales. The procedures used to investigate item order effects and parameter invariance yielded mixed results. Overall, this study provides evidence favorable to a CAT adaptation of the MMPI, and suggestions for further research are discussed.

T1  - The contribution of matric suction to the shear strength of unsaturated soils
AN  - 303722305
AB  - The shear strength of remolded specimens of an unsaturated, silty, copper tailings sand was measured in a triaxial apparatus. Multistage tests were completed under consolidated-drained (CD) conditions, where both the pore air and pore water pressures were controlled, and under constant water content (CW) conditions, where the specimen was drained with respect to the pore air pressure and undrained with respect to the pore water pressure. A triaxial testing system with automatic data capturing capabilities was assembled for the study.    A total of eight specimens were tested, two in a saturated condition and three each under unsaturated CD and CW conditions, respectively. The saturated specimens were staged with respect to increasing effective stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$), while each unsaturated specimen was tested with a constant value of net applied stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$), and increasing values of matric suction (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) from stage to stage. The range of net applied stress and matric suction studied was 15 to 150 kPa.    The parameter $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ quantifies the increase in shear strength which can be attributed to the matric suction stress state variable. The results indicated that the intersection of the failure surface with the plane containing the (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) axis was curved over the range of suction studied, and did not differ appreciably between the CD and CW test methods. This demonstrated uniqueness of the failure surface.    When account was made for a slight curvature in the failure surface in the direction of the ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$) axis, the variation in $\phi\sp\prime$ with respect to (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) was reduced. This supported the concept of independence of the shear strength parameters $\phi\sp\prime$, c$\sp\prime$, and $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ for unsaturated soils, and verified the form of the shear strength equation used in the study (Fredlund, Morgenstern, and Widger, 1978).

T1  - Simulation of hot strip rolling by compression testing: Effect of the variation of strain-rate on the constitutive behaviour of a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel
AN  - 276038323
AB  - The major objective of this investigation was to test experimentally the relative validity of simulating hot strip rolling by compression testing at constant true strain rates under axisymmetric conditions.    For the purpose of the simulation, the material's flow through the roll gap was theoretically modelled.    Isothermal, single- and multi-stage compression tests were carried out on a microprocessor-controlled servohydraulic testing system by using a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel. Cylindrical specimens were subjected to deformation at rates of strain either constant or varying as during a rolling pass/passes. True stress-true strain flow curves were obtained by correcting the measured stress-strain data for the effect of friction at the specimen/die interface. The constant friction shear factor was determined quantitatively by hot ring tests. Optical microscopy was used to observe the prior austenite microstructures.    Based on the results of single-stage, constant true strain-rate tests, the dependence of the flow strength as a function of strain, rate of strain and temperature was modelled by using an Arrhenius-type equation.    The comparison of the responses of the material to the two types of compression revealed no significant differences between flow curves except at the very end of the tests. This observation agreed with the predictions of the model, which was developed based on the constant strain-rate flow curves, indicating that the material follows a mechanical equation of state in hot rolling processes.    The flow curves and the average flow strengths were compared between the constant and varying strain-rate, four-stage tests. Differences were also found negligible. The variation of the average flow strength during multistage testing was dependent of the length of the interpass time and the average strain rate in a significant manner.    It was found that the microstructures developed from single- as well as multi-stage compression tests were independent of the variation of the strain rate during deformation.    This study showed that the constant true strain-rate compression testing is a very useful technique in simulating hot flat strip rolling processes.

T1  - REMEDIATION IN BASIC SKILLS MATHEMATICS WITH AND WITHOUT COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION (CAI, TUTORING, INDEPENDENT-STUDY)
AN  - 303437375
AB  - This study focused on the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in remedial mathematics when compared with tutoring and independent-study as methods of instruction. In this investigation, the relationship between these three methods of instruction and the ethnicity of the subjects was explored.    Results were measured by analyzing differences in achievement scores as measured by Computer Adaptive Testing and Comparative Guidance Placement. The results showed that there was a significant difference between minority and non-minorities for both tutoring and independent-study. Such differences are frequently encountered and are generally attributable to cultural differences or prior educational experiences, which may cause some minority students to experience emotional and value conflicts in the classroom. This could result in psychological defenses being called into play. No significant differences in test scores were apparent between minorities and non-minorities when using CAI as the method of instruction, indicating that CAI may not activate such defenses.    Results also showed that minorities scored significantly higher in testing after using CAI as a method of instruction than after using tutoring or independent-study methods. This suggests that CAI, when used for remedial instruction in basic skills mathematics, reduces the frequently encountered differences in achievement between minorities and non-minorities. This supports the theory that CAI is multicultural and a value-neutral tool that can assist to alleviate some of these pre-existing problems, thereby enabling minority students to attain greater academic success.

T1  - National Statistics to Improve Educational Productivity
AN  - 63304897; ED272571
AB  - The value of statistical research depends on valid comparisons which can usefully influence educational policy. Educational research needs to extend the measures of learning (such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress) through nationally-calibrated absolute measures and through computer-assisted and adaptive testing. Direct sampling by computer would make educational polls and national assessment faster and less expensive. A national bureau of educational standards might be founded to collect, coordinate, calibrate, archive, analyze, synthesize, and make available the data that is needed to improve educational productivity. Nine factors promoting efficiency and productivity of learning are classified in three broad categories: (1) student aptitude, including ability, development, and motivation; (2) instruction, including amount of time students engage in learning and quality of instructional experience; and (3) environmental factors, such as home climate, classroom social group, peer group, and television viewing. The tables in the appendix illustrate the effect of productivity factors on achievement revealed by quantitative syntheses carried out by a number of investigators in Australia, Canada and the United States during the past decade.

T1  - TEACHER AND STUDENT RESPONSES TO A SYSTEM FOR RATIONAL MEASUREMENT
AN  - 303459373
AB  - Feedback is a key element in the teaching/learning cycle. It tells teachers and students how they are progressing and how effective their instruction/learning has been. Despite the importance of feedback, it is rarely obtained in optimal ways and is poorly understood by teachers and students. The problem lies in ineffective methods of obtaining and utilizing feedback information.    This study has attempted to define, implement, and determine the effects of a set of rational measurement practices. It is based on the premise that testing should be an integral part of teaching, providing information to students and teachers in an efficient and non-intrusive manner. The components for rational measurement include well-written item sets which communicate teachers'expectations to students, individualized selection of items, detailed comments on student answers, and reports portraying the changing relationship of students to items as instruction proceeds. The system utilizes a microcomputer programmed with an algorithm for Rasch measurement and adaptive testing.    Nine classes participated in a study of the effectiveness of the system. After training, each teacher wrote item sets corresponding to two units. Qualitative data were gathered on teachers' use of measurement information for improving teaching practice. Teacher proficiency in writing items was measured. Students within classes were randomly assigned to four groups created by the crossing of a feedback factor and an item selection factor. Students were tested weekly with subsets of items from the set written by the teacher. Ability measures were obtained from each session to determine whether detailed feedback was effective in raising achievement. Attitude and anxiety data were collected at the beginning and end of each unit to assess whether adaptive item selection caused a more positive student reaction to testing.    Data analysis showed that four teachers used the system to improve their teaching. Three teachers displayed positive verbal responses, but did not change practices. Two teachers did not use the measurement information. There was no discernible increase in item-writing proficiency. Analysis of student data showed a nonsignificant positive effect of detailed feedback on student achievement. No difference between selection or feedback groups was observed for any affective measures.

T1  - The stability of a silty clay under repeated loading
AN  - 2312324222
AB  - The object of this research programme was to investigate the stability of a silty clay under undrained repeated loading. Equipment has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading. This model can be used to predict pore pressures and failure for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils.

AB  - BackgroundPatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be useful for patients with benign liver tumours and cysts (BLTC) to evaluate the impact of treatment and/or guide shared decision making. Yet, a set of PROMs relevant to patients with BLTC is currently unavailable. In this study, we selected a PROMs set for patients with BLTC.MethodsPotentially relevant patient reported outcomes (PROs) were selected by psychologist-researchers based on keywords used or suggested by participants of two virtual focus groups meetings consisting of thirteen female BLTC patients with a median age of 50 years. Subsequently, patients were asked to report their most relevant PROs. PROMs identified by systematic literature review and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) were considered in selecting the final PROMs set to assess relevant outcomes.ResultsThe most important PROs were: insecurity/anxiety (11/12 patients), pain (9/12 patients), fatigue (8/12 patients), and limitations in daily life (5/12 patients). The literature review included 23 studies, which used various generic and disease-specific PROMs, often not measuring (all) relevant PROs. The final selected PROMs set included numerical rating scales for pain, two questions on overall health and quality of life and four PROMIS CATs.ConclusionsA PROMs set generically and efficiently measuring outcomes relevant for patients with BLTC was developed and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

T1  - Computer adaptive testing to assess impairing behavioral health problems in emergency department patients with somatic complaints
AN  - 2729945609
AB  - ObjectivesTo assess: (1) the prevalence of mental health and substance use in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through use of a computer adaptive test (CAT‐MH), (2) the correlation among CAT‐MH scores and self‐ and clinician‐reported assessments, and (3) the association between CAT‐MH scores and ED utilization in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment.MethodsThis was a single‐center observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED for somatic complaints (97%) from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes were computer‐adaptive‐assessed domains of suicidality, depression, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We conducted Pearson correlations and logistic regression for objectives 2 and 3, respectively.ResultsFrom a sample of 794 patients, the proportion of those at moderate/severe risk was: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). CAT‐MH domains were highly correlated with self‐report assessments (r = 0.49–0.79). Individuals who had 2 or more ED visits in the prior year had 62% increased odds of being in the intermediate‐high suicide risk category (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–2.44) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. Individuals who scored in the intermediate‐high‐suicide risk group had 63% greater odds of an ED visit within 30 days after enrollment compared to those who scored as low risk (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.44).ConclusionThe CAT‐MH documented that a considerable proportion of ED patients presenting for somatic problems had mental health conditions, even if mild. Mental health problems were also associated with ED utilization.

T1  - Automated Speech Audiometry for Integrated Voice Over Internet Protocol Communication Services
AN  - 2717146391
AB  - Purpose: Problems in speech recognition are often apparent in telecommunication situations. For ecologically valid assessments of such conditions, it is important to quantify the impact of real environments including acoustic conditions at a far-end communication device and all paths of transmission degradation. This study presents an automated matrix sentence test procedure based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) integrated in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure and compares the individual effects of transmission degradations with results from laboratory measurements. Method: Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in 16 normalhearing subjects in four test conditions: (a) a laboratory condition guided by a human experimenter, (b) a laboratory condition with reduced bandwidth and (c) additionally reduced headset quality to simulate typical communication systems, and (d) an automated, ASR-controlled adaptive test procedure over a real VoIP infrastructure. Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and "laboratory" conditions, with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.

T1  - The Impact of Local Item Dependence on Computer Adaptive Testing Given Between and Within Testlet Adaptivity
AN  - 2729529785
AB  - In educational tests, a group of questions related to a shared stimulus is called a testlet (e.g., a reading passage with multiple related questions). Use of testlets is very common in educational tests. Additionally, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a mode of testing where the test forms are created in real time tailoring to the test taker's previous responses. CATs have gained popularity because they produce a more accurate test score estimate within a shorter time with fewer questions. In this dissertation, the performance of CAT with testlets was studied. 
Conditional independence is an essential assumption of Item Response Models. However, when testlets are used, item responses to the items in the same testlet may not be independent since these items are associated with a common stimulus. In this case, the conditional independence assumption is violated, and this violation can affect the entire performance of CAT and lead to inaccurate test scores. 
Common practice for testlet based CATs is to select a testlet adaptively and administer all the items bundled in the testlet. However, the accuracy and efficiency aspects of CAT may not be fully realized with this approach of adaptivity. To increase the accuracy and efficiency in testlet-based CATs, between and within testlet adaptivity was studied. Other manipulated variables were the level of adaptivity, different testlet/item selection approaches, latent trait estimation methods, test length/number of testlets, and magnitude of testlet dependence. The performances of testlet based CATs with various scenarios were evaluated descriptively by running a series of simulations. One of the important findings of the study is that not only between testlets but also within testlets adaptation improved the performance of the CAT for more accurate and precise estimation of the latent traits. The results will serve as a baseline for future research and practice.

T1  - Psychometric Performance of a Condition-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument for Dutch Children Born with Esophageal Atresia
AN  - 2728451966
AB  - A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL©) to assess quality of life of children born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance in Dutch children. After Swedish–Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old children, 8/17 items had >5% missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual child’s situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in different countries are needed.

T1  - Improving Test Security and Efficiency of Computerized Adaptive Testing for the Force Concept Inventory
AN  - 2722551713; EJ1343470
AB  - This paper presents improvements made to a computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-based version of the FCI (FCI-CAT) in regards to test security and test efficiency. First, we will discuss measures to enhance test security by controlling for item overexposure, decreasing the risk that respondents may (i) memorize the content of a pretest for use on the post-test or (ii) share information about the items with their classmates who take the assessment later. Second, we will discuss measures to enhance test efficiency, so that a shorter test length can yield a desired accuracy and precision of the measurement. Specifically, we utilized collateral information in the form of a pretest proficiency estimate of each respondent for selecting items and estimating respondent proficiency level in the post-test. To shorten the total testing time further, we also allowed the test lengths to be different for the pre- and post-test. To analyze how these improvements affect the accuracy and precision (which we measure in terms of root-mean-square error) of Cohen's d, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation and a "post hoc" simulation. Then, we calculated the minimal test length of the FCI-CAT whose accuracy and precision are equivalent to that of the paper-and-pencil version of the FCI. Consequently, we obtained the following three findings: (i) By using collateral information, we can achieve the accuracy and precision of the full-length FCI with fewer items via the FCI-CAT. (ii) For a class size of 40, we can control for test security while still reducing the sum of the pre- and post-test lengths of the FCI-CAT to a total of 33 items (17 items on the pretest and 16 items on the post-test), thereby reducing the testing time to 55%. (iii) If one's goal is to maximize test efficiency, the pretest length should be slightly larger than the post-test length. On the other hand, if the goal is to maximize test security, the pretest length should be smaller and the post-test length should be larger. If one desires a balance of these two goals, it would be reasonable to choose equal pre- and post-test lengths.

T1  - Developing a Web-Based App to Assess Mental Health Difficulties in Secondary School Pupils: Qualitative User-Centered Design Study
AN  - 2624025081
AB  - Background: Secondary schools are an ideal setting to identify young people experiencing mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression. However, current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment.
Objective: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools.
Methods: This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cycles—an initial stakeholder consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed.
Results: Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for designing mental health assessment apps are also provided.
Conclusions: Artemis-A is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training. Future research will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Artemis-A in a range of UK secondary schools.

T1  - Item Characteristic Curve Asymmetry: A Better Way to Accommodate Slips and Guesses than a Four-Parameter Model?
AN  - 2608863707; EJ1317106
AB  - Four-parameter models have received increasing psychometric attention in recent years, as a reduced upper asymptote for item characteristic curves can be appealing for measurement applications such as adaptive testing and person-fit assessment. However, applications can be challenging due to the large number of parameters in the model. In this article, we demonstrate in the context of mathematics assessments how the slip and guess parameters of a four-parameter model may often be empirically related. This observation also has a psychological explanation to the extent that both asymptote parameters may be manifestations of a single item complexity characteristic. The relationship between lower and upper asymptotes motivates the consideration of an asymmetric item response theory model as a three-parameter alternative to the four-parameter model. Using actual response data from mathematics multiple-choice tests, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of a three-parameter asymmetric model in several standardized tests of mathematics. To the extent that a model of asymmetry ultimately portrays slips and guesses not as purely random but rather as proficiency-related phenomena, we argue that the asymmetric approach may also have greater psychological plausibility.

T1  - Psychometric Properties of the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory in a Nationally Representative Sample of Youth
AN  - 2583230001
AB  - Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Scientific Standards and refined through factor analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI’s psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth.Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI’s structure and psychometric properties.Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences.Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

T1  - Applying Item Response Theory to the OPD Structure Questionnaire: Identification of a Unidimensional Core Construct and Feasibility of Computer Adaptive Testing
AN  - 2564184059
AB  - Recent developments in the dimensional assessment of personality functioning have made the implementation of latent measurement models increasingly attractive. In this study, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a well-established personality functioning instrument (the OPD Structure Questionnaire) to identify a unidimensional latent trait and to evaluate the feasibility of computer adaptive testing (CAT). We hypothesized that the use of IRT could reduce the test burden – compared to a fixed short form – while maintaining high precision over a wide range of the latent trait. The OPD-SQ was collected from 1235 patients in a psychosomatic clinic. IRT assumptions were fulfilled. A 9-factor model yielded sufficient fit and unidimensionality in exploratory factor analysis with bifactor rotation. Items were iteratively reduced, and a graded-response IRT model was fitted to the data. Simulations showed that a CAT with approximately 7 items was able to capture an OPD-SQ global severity score with an accuracy similar to that of a fixed 12-item short form. The final item bank and CAT yielded satisfactory content validity. Strong correlations with depression and anxiety replicated previous results on the OPD-SQ. We concluded that IRT applications could be useful to reduce the test burden of personality functioning instruments.

T1  - Development and validation of computerized adaptive assessment tools for the measurement of posttraumatic stress disorder among US military veterans
AN  - 2553796755; 1572666
AB  -   IMPORTANCE: Veterans from recent and past conflicts have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5. RESULTS: Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r = 0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r = 0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic screening and severity measurement are possible. [Author Abstract]

T1  - Predicting suicidality using a computer adaptive test: Two longitudinal studies of sexual and gender minority youth
AN  - 2518415392
AB  - Objective: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk assessments need to be validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of a highly efficient computerized adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among SGMY. Methods: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n = 1,073) and at their follow-up visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity were performed. Results: Younger, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual (e.g., bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender nonconforming or nongender binary (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior wave. Conclusions: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for the identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual, and gender nonconforming or nongender binary.

T1  - Estimating Psychometric Properties of Computerized Multistage Testing
AN  - 2572971681
AB  - In recent decades, computerized multistage testing (MST) has been utilized as an alternative testing mode for large-scale testing programs. Although the usage of MST has been discussed extensively, there is little literature that addresses its psychometric properties. The motivation of this dissertation arises from the need to properly estimate psychometric properties under the MST framework. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrated set of formulas for estimating psychometric properties for MST, including error variance, reliability, and classification indices. To achieve this goal, existing methods that are used for the traditional P\&P tests are extended to the MST context, if possible; and new methods are proposed based on the characteristics of MST (i.e., routing probability) for the ML and EAP estimators. For the ML estimator, a conventional approach to computing MST test information analytically is also included for estimating the psychometric properties. The proposed approach and the conventional approach are then applied to a single set of MST data, with varied conditions. Further, a simulation approach is employed for the purpose of understanding and comparing the performance of the proposed approach and conventional approach. In the simulation approach, replications of test data are used to obtain results.
The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) for the ML estimator, the proposed analytic approach performed better than the conventional approach, indicated by comparing their results with those from the simulation approach; (2) for the EAP estimator, results from using the Bayesian approach approach led to smaller values of marginal error variances and higher values of reliability, compared with the quadrature approach; (3) longer test resulted in decreased error variances and improved reliability; (4) for the EAP Bayesian approach, increasing sample size had a limited impact on the estimation results; (5) for all the approaches, conditional classification consistency and accuracy gradually decreased when the ability parameter was moving further away from the cut scores. All of the estimation formulas provided in this dissertation can be applied directly to MST data in practice.

T1  - Evaluation of the measurement properties of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) in Hispanic caregivers to patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders
AN  - 2448808299
AB  - Objectives:The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used measure of perceived stress; however, minimal psychometric evaluation has been performed among Hispanic respondents, and even less among Hispanic caregivers to persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRDs).Design:Secondary data analysis.Setting:New York City, NY, USA.Participants:A sample of 453 community dwelling Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD.Measurements:Latent variable models were used to evaluate the PSS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine unidimensionality. Differential item functioning (DIF) was examined for age, education, and language using the graded item response model.Results:The factor and bifactor analyses results supported essential unidimensionality of the item set; however, positively worded items were observed using response item theory to be less informative than the negatively worded items. Reliability estimates were high. Salient DIF was not observed for age, education, or language of interview using the primary DIF detection method. Sensitivity analyses using a second DIF detection method identified uniform language-DIF for the item, “In the last month, how often have you felt that you were on top of things?” However, the non-compensatory DIF value was below the threshold considered salient.Conclusions:In summary, the 10-item PSS performed well in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. Very little DIF, and none of high magnitude and impact, was observed. However, the negatively worded items, perhaps because they are more directly reflective of stress, were more informative. In the context of a short-form measure or computerized adaptive test, more informative items are those that would be selected for inclusion.

T1  - Development of a computerized adaptive substance use disorder scale for screening and measurement: the CAT‐SUD: (Alcoholism and Drug Addiction)
AN  - 2411430799
AB  - Background and aimsThe focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multi‐dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risk‐taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the item‐bank, (2) calibrate the item‐bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptom‐specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CAT‐SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain.DesignItem bank construction, item calibration phase, CAT‐SUD validation phase.SettingPrimary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patient‐to‐patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles).Participants/casesCalibration phase: the CAT‐SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CAT‐SUD.MeasurementsA total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CAT‐SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis.FindingsCalibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multi‐dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168‐item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100‐point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CAT‐SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20‐fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CAT‐SUD (AUC = 0.85).ConclusionsWe have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multi‐dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CAT‐SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

T1  - Stopping Rules for Computer Adaptive Testing When Item Banks Have Nonuniform Information
AN  - 2400034544
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

T1  - Classification and Regression Tree and Computer Adaptive Testing in Cardiac Rehabilitation: Instrument Validation Study
AN  - 2737517712
AB  - Background: There is a need for shorter-length assessments that capture patient questionnaire data while attaining high data quality without an undue response burden on patients. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods have the potential to meet these needs and can offer attractive options to shorten questionnaire lengths.
Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT or CART was best suited to reduce the number of questionnaire items in multiple domains (eg, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and social support) used for a needs assessment procedure (NAP) within the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) without the loss of data quality.
Methods: NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a Web-based portal, MyCARDSS, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
Results: With CAT and CART, an overall reduction of 36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length, respectively, was achieved, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT, 0.777 and 0.877 for classification trees, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees, respectively.
Conclusions: Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the NAP used within the field of CR. CART, however, showed the best performance, with a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress in multiple domains. For CR professionals, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their patients by providing real-time patient measurements.

T1  - <strong>Assessment of Fatigue in Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease:</strong> Validation of PROMIS Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test and Identifying Correlates of Fatigue in Patients with End-Stage Kdney Disease
AN  - 2466269139
AB  - Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The routine assessment of fatigue with patient-reported outcome measures can help clinicians identify and manage fatigue efficiently. In this study, the measurement properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Fatigue CAT) were assessed in patients with ESKD. A cross-sectional sample of adult patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients completed the PROMIS Fatigue CAT as well as a legacy instrument. PROMIS Fatigue CAT demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Excellent discrimination was also found for PROMIS Fatigue CAT to discriminate patients with fatigue. In addition, sex, depression, anxiety, social support and self-reported health status were strongly associated with fatigue. Thus, PROMIS Fatigue CAT may be a useful measure of fatigue and psychosocial interventions may be important to consider in the management of fatigue in patients with ESKD.

AN  - 2459005490; EJ1254419
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the "SE" is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the "SE" threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the "SE" stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

T1  - Comparison of patient-reported outcomes measurement information system and legacy instruments in multiple domains among older veterans with chronic back pain
AN  - 2444064198
AB  - Background 
Chronic low back pain (cLBP) results in significant physical, psycho-social and socioeconomic burden. Identifying efficient and reliable patient reported outcome measures is critical for research and clinical purposes. The NIH’s Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments have not been compared to validated “legacy” instruments in older adults with cLBP. This study evaluates construct (convergent and discriminant) validity and time to complete (TTC) PROMIS as compared to legacy instruments.
 Methods 
We enrolled older Veterans (age 60+) with cLBP with/without leg pain scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Subjects completed PROMIS computer adaptive test item banks and corresponding legacy instruments in the following domains: pain intensity, interference, and behavior; functional status; depression and anxiety; fatigue; sleep and social functioning. Convergent and discriminant validity between PROMIS and legacy instruments was evaluated using Spearman rank order correlations; Mann-Whitney U tests compared TTC.
 Results 
Of the 71 Veterans recruited, the median (IQR) age was 67 (63–71) years old, 94% were men, 76% were White, 17% Black, and 96% were Non-Hispanic. Spearman correlations between PROMIS and legacy instruments showed moderate to very strong convergent validity in all domains (r = 0.4–1.0), except for social functioning and pain behavior (PROMIS Pain Behavior with Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire). The total median TTC for all PROMIS items was significantly shorter than legacy items, 8 min 50 s vs 29 min 14 s respectively, p < 0.001.
 Conclusions 
Given time efficiency of using PROMIS, along with strong construct validity, PROMIS instruments are a practical choice for measuring multidimensional PROs in older Veterans with cLBP for both research and clinical purposes.

T1  - Are student nurses ready for new technologies in mental health? Mixed-methods study
AN  - 2338151433
AB  - Background Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. Method Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. Results We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.

T1  - Detection of Cognitive Change: Examination of Approaches for Improving The Accuracy on Impact
AN  - 2303324792
AB  - Concussion is an increasingly recognized public health concern. Proper assessment and management of concussion are critical factors in mitigating adverse effects associated with this injury. Neuropsychological assessment has demonstrated utility in identifying cognitive symptoms related to concussion and monitoring their resolution. Early methods involved administering paper and pencil tests to appraise cognitive domains thought to be most affected by concussion. As interest in concussion and methods of assessment evolved, baseline testing became an integral component of assessment in sport-related concussion (SRC). Baseline testing consists of administering a healthy, or non-injured, individual a battery of cognitive tests that subsequently serve as a reference point to evaluate the individual’s performance on the same tests following a suspected injury or change in cognitive status. Recent advances, spurred by an interest in increasing access to baseline testing, contributed to the adoption of computerized neurocognitive tests (CNTs). CNTs allow for baseline testing of groups of individuals, in one setting, and in a short amount of time. Immediate Post Concussion and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) has emerged as the most commonly used CNT in the assessment and management of SRC. This body of research aimed to explore ImPACT’s reliability and validity to appraise its efficacy in accurately detecting cognitive change associated with concussion and explore potential improvements. The first chapter is devoted to examining ImPACT’s test-retest reliability, which refers to the expected consistency in results over time in healthy individuals. This study examines ImPACT score reports for 107 healthy individuals that included testing at two time points. Results reveal less than adequate test-retest reliability attributable to, at least in part, a restricted range of possible scores, or the presence of a ceiling effect, on numerous subscales. Additional discussion includes corrective measures, such as proactively identifying individuals producing maximum scores on baseline testing, extending the length of subscales, and incorporating adaptive testing. The second chapter evaluates ImPACT’s validity, and specifically, its classification accuracy in differentiating between individuals with and without concussion. This study incorporates a novel approach through its use of standardized regression based (SRB) reliable change index (RCI) scores to measure post-injury testing deviations from baseline scores. The SRB methodology, coupled with discriminant function analyses (DFAs), is compared to current interpretive procedures. The study includes 129 individuals without concussion whose SRB RCI scores are compared to 81 individuals with concussion. Results of analyses suggest that the current interpretive procedure performs at a chance level in accurately identifying individuals with concussion; conversely, the SRB method and DFA approach yield positive predictive values exceeding 80%, however sensitivities below 50%. Additionally, the Post Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), a self-report measure of symptoms, is largely equivalent to ImPACT’s cognitive measures in classification accuracy. Collectively, these results raise considerable concern regarding ImPACT’s efficacy as a measure to aid in the assessment and management of concussion.

T1  - Calibration of an item bank in 474 orthopedic patients using Rasch analysis for computer-adaptive assessment of anxiety
AN  - 2281774362
AB  - Objective:To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test.Design:This is a psychometric study.Setting:The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany.Subjects:A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study.Interventions:Not applicable.Main measures:The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients.Results:The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item–trait interaction (χ2(203) = 172.59; P = .94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits).Conclusion:The unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

T1  - Computerized Quality of Life Assessment: A Randomized Experiment to Determine the Impact of Individualized Feedback on Assessment Experience
AN  - 2269958634
AB  - Background Quality of life (QoL) assessments, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), are becoming increasingly important in health care and have been associated with improved decision making, higher satisfaction, and better outcomes of care. Some physicians and patients may find questionnaires too burdensome; however, this issue could be addressed by making use of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In addition, making the questionnaire more interesting, for example by providing graphical and contextualized feedback, may further improve the experience of the users. However, little is known about how shorter assessments and feedback impact user experience. Objective We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the impact of tailored multimodal feedback and CAT on user experience in QoL assessment using validated PROMs. Methods We recruited a representative sample from the general population in the United Kingdom using the Oxford Prolific academic Web panel. Participants completed either a CAT version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-CAT) or the fixed-length WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100. We randomly assigned participants to conditions in which they would receive no feedback, graphical feedback only, or graphical and adaptive text-based feedback. Participants rated the assessment in terms of perceived acceptability, engagement, clarity, and accuracy. Results We included 1386 participants in our analysis. Assessment experience was improved when graphical and tailored text-based feedback was provided along with PROMs (Δ=0.22, P<.001). Providing graphical feedback alone was weakly associated with improvement in overall experience (Δ=0.10, P=.006). Graphical and text-based feedback made the questionnaire more interesting, and users were more likely to report they would share the results with a physician or family member (Δ=0.17, P<.001, and Δ=0.17, P<.001, respectively). No difference was found in perceived accuracy of the graphical feedback scores of the WHOQOL-CAT and WHOQOL-BREF (Δ=0.06, P=.05). CAT (stopping rule [SE<0.45]) resulted in the administration of 25% fewer items than the fixed-length assessment, but it did not result in an improved user experience (P=.21). Conclusions Using tailored text-based feedback to contextualize numeric scores maximized the acceptability of electronic QoL assessment. Improving user experience may increase response rates and reduce attrition in research and clinical use of PROMs. In this study, CAT administration was associated with a modest decrease in assessment length but did not improve user experience. Patient-perceived accuracy of feedback was equivalent when comparing CAT with fixed-length assessment. Fixed-length forms are already generally acceptable to respondents; however, CAT might have an advantage over longer questionnaires that would be considered burdensome. Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between assessment length, feedback, and response burden in diverse populations.

T1  - Integrating PROMIS® computerized adaptive tests into a web-based intervention for prostate cancer
AN  - 2222645398
AB  - Objective: This study outlined the implementation and feasibility of delivering PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) using a web-based method to evaluate the impact of a technological adaptation of Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) on the psychosocial functioning of men with advanced prostate cancer (APC) undergoing hormone therapy. Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS® CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS® domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS® anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS® CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

T1  - Relationship Between PROMIS Computer Adaptive Tests and Legacy Hip Measures Among Patients Presenting to a Tertiary Care Hip Preservation Center
AN  - 2234586780
AB  - Background:Legacy hip outcome measures may be burdensome to patients and sometimes yield floor or ceiling effects. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) allow for low-burden data capture and limited ceiling and floor effects.Purpose/Hypothesis:The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PROMIS CAT domains demonstrate correlation against commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The authors hypothesized the following: (1) PROMIS CAT scores based on physical function (PF), pain interference (PIF), pain behavior, and pain intensity would show strong correlation with the following legacy scores: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), International Hip Outcome Tool–12 (iHOT-12), Hip Outcome Score (HOS) Sports and Activities of Daily Living subscales, and Veterans RAND–6D (VR-6D) utility measure. (2) The mental and physical health portions of the VR-6D legacy measure would show weak correlation with mental- and psychosocial-specific PROMIS elements—depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. (3) All PROMIS measures would exhibit fewer floor and ceiling effects than legacy scores.Study Design:Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Prospective data were collected on 125 patients in the hip preservation clinics. Enrollees completed legacy scores (visual analog scale for pain, mHHS, iHOT-12, HOS, and VR-6D) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (PF, PIF, pain behavior, anxiety, depression, sleep, social roles and activities, pain intensity, fatigue). Spearman rank correlations were calculated, with rs values of 0 to 0.3 indicating negligible correlation; 0.3 to 0.5, weak correlation; 0.5 to 0.7, moderately strong correlation; and >0.7, strong correlation. Floor and ceiling effects were evaluated.Results:As anticipated, the PF-CAT yielded strong correlations with the iHOT-12, mHHS, HOS–Sports, HOS–Activities of Daily Living, and VR-6D, with rs values of 0.76, 0.71, 0.81, 0.87, and 0.71, respectively. The PIF-CAT was the only pain score to show moderately strong to strong correlation with all 14 patient-reported outcome measures. A strong correlation was observed between the VR-6D and the social roles and activities CAT (rs = 0.73). The depression CAT had a significant floor effect at 19%. No additional floor or ceiling effect was present for any other legacy or PROMIS measure.Conclusion:The PF-CAT shows strong correlation with legacy patient-reported outcome scores among patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The PIF-CAT also correlates strongly with legacy and PROMIS measures evaluating physical and mental well-being. PROMIS measures are less burdensome and demonstrate no floor or ceiling effects, making them a potential alternative to legacy patient-reported outcome measures for the hip.

T1  - Performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF Procedures in a Computerized Multistage Testing Environment
AN  - 2647707280
AB  - This study investigates the performance of the Mantel-Haenszel and CATSIB DIF procedures independently and in comparative terms in a computerized multistage testing (MST) environment. A simulation study was conducted to mimic an operational testing environment. Three factors that may typically affect DIF detection in an MST environment were manipulated – sample size (250, 500), impact (0, 0.5, 1) and DIF magnitude (0.45, 0.9). A fourth factor (DIF method) was included at the analysis stage to understand its effect on the outcomes. The criteria for evaluating the results were Type I error rates and power rates. Results reveal that MH has better control of Type I error rates across various study conditions. With respect to power, MH was more powerful in detecting large DIF for the large sample size condition (power rate of 1.00) compared to CATSIB, which had power rates between .84 and 1.00 under the same conditions. Regression results reveal that there were interaction effects of the study factors on Type I error rates and power rates. These results will guide practitioners on best practices regarding DIF detection procedures under various conditions in computerized MST environments. This research adds to the extant literature that promotes psychometric methods that can assist in ensuring that operational test scores are aligned with the principals of item-level statistical fairness.

T1  - Adult Learning across USA, Canada, and New Zealand: A Cross-Cultural Study of PIAAC
AN  - 2461117162; EJ1214292
AB  - Skeptics of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trend for International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) argue that while US elementary and high school students are behind their peers in other nations, the US workforce is still excellent because of the high quality post-secondary educational institutions in the US. However, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) indicates that US adults are in fact far behind their international peers in literacy, numeracy, and technology-based problem solving. Through the use of data mining, this study explored the possible association between PIAAC scores and several constructs. Since the US, Canada, and New Zealand were considered culturally similar nations, according to cluster analysis, patterns between PIAAC scores and selected constructs were analyzed by a variety of big data analytical methods, including cluster analysis, bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and data visualization. Given that PIAAC used multiple computerized adaptive testing, the consequential plausible values were randomly selected when the ensemble approach was used. Additionally, model comparison was utilized to decide between bagging and boosting in order to select the optimal model for each sample. In these samples, cultural engagement, readiness to learn, and social trust, respectively emerged as strong predictors for learning outcomes as they were assessed by PIAAC.

T1  - Optimizing Design of Incorporating Off-Grade Items for Constrained Computerized Adaptive Testing in K-12 Assessment
AN  - 2305945464
AB  - Incorporating off-grade items within an on-grade item pool is often seen in K-12 testing programs. Incorporating off-grade items may provide improvements in measurement precision, test length, and content blueprint fulfillment, especially for high- and low-performing examinees, but it may also identify some concerns when using too many off-grade items on tests that are primarily designed to measure grade-level standards. This dissertation investigates how practical constraints such as the number of on-grade items, the proportion, and range of off-grade items, and the stopping rules affect item pool characteristics and item pool performance in adaptive testing.This study includes simulation conditions with four study factors: (1) three on-grade pool sizes (150, 300, and 500 items), (2) three proportions of off-grade items in the item pool (small, moderate, and large), (3) two ranges of off-grade items (one grade level and two grade levels), and (4) two stopping rules (variable- and fixed-length stopping rule) with two SE threshold levels. All the results are averaged across 200 replications for each simulation condition.The item pool characteristics are summarized using descriptive statistics and histograms of item difficulty (the b-parameters), descriptive statistics and plots of test information functions (TIFs), and the standard errors of the ability estimate (SEEs). The item pool performance is evaluated based on the descriptive statistics of measurement precision, test length and exposure properties, content blueprint fulfillment, and mean proportion of off-grade items for each test.The results show that there are some situations in which incorporating off-grade items would be beneficial. For example, a testing organization with a small item pool attempting to improve item pool performance for high- and low-performing examinees. The results also show that practical constraints of incorporating off-grade items, organized here from most impact to least impact in item pool characteristics and item pool performance, are: 1) incorporating off-grade items into small baseline pool or large baseline pool; 2) broadening the range of off-grade items from one grade level to two grade levels; 3) increasing the proportion of off-grade items in the item pool; and 4) applying variable- or fixed-length CAT. The results indicated that broadening the range of off-grade items yields improvements in measurement precision and content blueprint fulfillment when compared to increasing the proportion of off-grade items. This study could serve as guidance for test organizations when considering the benefits and limitations of incorporating off-grade items into on-grade item pools.

T1  - Exam Anxiety: Using Paired Adaptive Tests to Reduce Stress in Business Classes
AN  - 2228651872; EJ1203830
AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

T1  - Comparison of two test methods for VIS: paper-pencil test and CAT
AN  - 2112006727
AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

T1  - Predictors of health-related quality of life in chronically ill children and adolescents over time
AN  - 2088836455
AB  - Objective This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five dimensions of HRQoL. Methods Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; aged 7–17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & Peers, and School WB over time. Results Besides effects of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations over time. Conclusions HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

T1  - Accuracy of the of the PROMIS-57 questionnaire to identify significant depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients on hemodialysis
AN  - 2088794123
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone© crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

T1  - Correlation of PROMIS CAT instruments with Oswestry Disability Index in chiropractic patients
AN  - 2088124940
AB  - Background The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Methods All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. Results The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170 ± 67 s (average ± Stdev) to answer 25 ± 6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R2 values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R2 values of 0.5236. Conclusions PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

T1  - Improving Assessment of Work Related Mental Health Function Using the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB)
AN  - 2006744623
AB  - Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security Administration’s (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood & emotions, resilience, social interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition & communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental health subdomains: Cognition & Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 items), Resilience & Sociability (29 items) and Mood & Emotions (34 items). All scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational rehabilitation settings.

T1  - Large-Scale Multiple Hypothesis Testing and Simultaneous Inference: Compound Decision Theory and Data Driven Procedures
AN  - 2408568105
AB  - Two-sample multiple testing has a wide range of applications. The conventional practice first reduces the original observations to a vector of p-values and then chooses a cutoff to adjust for multiplicity. However, this data reduction step could cause significant loss of information and thus lead to suboptimal testing procedures. In this thesis, I present a new framework for two-sample multiple testing by incorporating a carefully constructed auxiliary variable in inference to improve the power. A data-driven multiple testing procedure is developed by employing a covariate-assisted ranking and screening (CARS) approach that optimally combines the information from both the primary and auxiliary variables. The proposed CARS procedure is shown to be asymptotic valid and optimal for false discovery rate (FDR) control. The procedure is implemented in the R-package CARS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of CARS in FDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. CARS is also illustrated through an application to the analysis of satellite imaging data set for supernova detection.
In addition to the aforementioned two-sample multiple testing problem, multistage designs have been used in a wide range of scientific fields as well. By allocating sensing resources adaptively, one can effectively eliminate null locations and localize signals with a smaller study budget. We formulate a decision-theoretic framework for simultaneous multistage adaptive testing and study how to minimize the total number of measurements while meeting pre-specified constraints on both the false positive rate (FPR) and missed discovery rate (MDR). The new procedure, which effectively pools information across individual tests using a simultaneous multistage adaptive ranking and thresholding (SMART) approach, can achieve precise error rates control and lead to great savings in total study costs. Numerical studies confirm the effectiveness of SMART for FPR and MDR control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. The SMART procedure is demonstrated through the analysis of high-throughput screening data and spatial imaging data.
I also discuss ongoing and future research directions in this thesis, particularly on the topics of online FDR control and structured multiple testing. For applications, I discuss in detail on using online FDR control for real time anomaly detection for user engagement metrics at Snap Inc.

T1  - Comparison of Two Test Methods for VIS: Paper-Pencil Test and CAT
AN  - 2155996241; EJ1192194
AB  - This paper examines listening comprehension skills of visually impaired students (VIS) using computerised adaptive testing (CAT) and reader-assisted paper-pencil testing (raPPT) and student views about them. Explanatory mixed method design was used in this study. Sample is comprised of 51 VIS, in 7th and 8th grades. 9 of these students were interviewed for determining student views about tests. Results indicated that scores obtained from CAT are significantly lower than scores obtained from raPPT. Additionally, a positive and high correlation was found between scores of CAT and raPPT. This result suggests that similar ability estimations were made by CAT and raPPT. Another finding is CAT made more reliable predictions, and was completed in shorter duration using fewer items. In qualitative part, student views were gathered through interviews and content analysis revealed three themes as technical features, test features, and psychological effects. In general, students reported positive views about CAT. VIS prefer CAT due to its listening/control options, shorter test durations, clarity of reading, and fairness of test, elimination of dependency to reader. Study provides implications for test developers and test-users to consider CAT as a multi-accommodation for VIS through its advantages.

T1  - Predicting Certification Success for the Family Nurse Practitioner
AN  - 2050014573
AB  - High-stakes licensure or certification examinations are required for many health professions disciplines to ensure safe entry-level practice. Accrediting agencies set a benchmark for graduates’ first-time licensure or certification success as a measure of program effectiveness. Failures of graduates on licensure or certification examinations may directly affect the school’s recruitment and retention of qualified students and faculty, as well as institutional financial viability. A health science university has added Health Education System, Inc. (HESI) standardized examinations using computer adaptive testing into the family nurse practitioner (FNP) master’s program to support certification success, although research on these advanced practice examinations as related to certification outcomes was lacking. Guided by classical test theory, this study was an investigation of whether a relationship existed between students’ performance on 4 HESI standardized examinations (Advanced Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacotherapeutics, Advanced Health Assessment, and the APRN/FNP Exit exam) and first-time FNP certification success. Binary logistic regression analysis of data from 117 students who graduated between 2013–2016 indicated that none of the 4 standardized HESI examinations significantly predicted FNP certification success, perhaps due to the examinations not carrying any evaluative weight within the program. The results of this project study may be used to promote positive social change by providing a means to improve first-time certification success and increasing the availability of primary care providers in the role of FNP.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing in Pediatric Brain Tumor Clinics
AN  - 1963430746
AB  - Context: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. Objective: This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. Methods: Patients (ages 7-22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. Results: Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

T1  - Examining the Construct Validity of the MMPI-2-RF Interpersonal Functioning Scales Using the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder as a Comparative Framework
AN  - 1911185698
AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) interpersonal functioning scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011) using as a criterion measure the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms et al., 2011). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial ([greater than or equal to] |.30|) correlations. The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested.

T1  - Online Tools for Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation Among Graduate Students and Clinicians
AN  - 1978490262
AB  - Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice (EBBP) is a transdisciplinary systematic approach that emphasizes the use of best evidence in combination with clinical expertise, as well as patient preferences and values, to make clinically-informed decisions about care and treatment (Spring, 2007). Despite numerous benefits and strong policy support of EBBP, findings indicate that clinicians generally fail to implement EBBP in standard clinical practice due to a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and low self-efficacy associated with an absence of resources.    To address the need for EBBP resources and tools, Bonnie Spring, PhD and colleagues developed a theory-driven website for graduate students and clinicians. The website is primarily comprised of two components: nine interactive training modules and a novel assessment portal that utilizes patient-reported computer adaptive tests (CATs). To date, the training modules and assessment portal have not been evaluated, and there is currently a critical need to incorporate mixed methods evaluations into EBBP implementation science. The goal of this dissertation is to contribute to the ongoing evaluation and optimization of the EBBP Project by conducting summative and implementation-focused formative evaluations of its training modules and assessment portal.     Aim 1 evaluated changes in user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy for each EBBP module and determined whether these outcomes varied by user characteristics, including degree, professional discipline, and number of completed modules. Together, findings suggested heightened interest and use of asynchronous, web-based training modules about EBBP in social work and psychology, and that these modules can produce short-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about EBBP. Overall, however, attrition continues to be a challenge.    To better understand the attrition rates of the EBBP training modules and web-based modules, in general, Aim 2 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics related to module engagement. Overall, findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses (i.e., mixed method analyses) revealed that specific instructional guidance and interactive features, coupled with user technical knowledge, are particularly important characteristics that may improve engagement in asynchronous web-based training modules.   Given the novelty of the EBBP assessment portal, Aim 3 conducted implementation-focused formative evaluations to assess individual-level and intervention-level characteristics associated with its engagement and implementation. Results from mixed method analyses suggested that user knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy, coupled with programmatic functions to ensure privacy and confidentiality of patient information, may be important characteristics to improving engagement with a CATs-based assessment portal.    In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information on the short-term effectiveness of asynchronous web-based modules, and factors that may contribute to engagement and implementation of online training and clinical tools for EBBP.

T1  - Aberrant response detection using change-point analysis
AN  - 1874567901
AB  - Aberrant responses, which are caused by examinees' unusual behaviors (e.g., carelessness, speededness, item pre-knowledge, warm-up, copying answers from neighbors), are frequently seen in various testing programs. Having aberrant responses may bias item parameter estimates and threaten test validity. Thus proper modeling and detection of aberrant responses is crucial both theoretically and practically in educational and psychological measurement.    Previous work has primarily approached the aberrant responses research in terms of developing person fit statistics and proposing models to capture the aberrant behaviors. This dissertation attempts to incorporate change-point analysis (CPA) to investigate two types of aberrant responses: speededness and warm-up effect; both of which can be viewed as having an abrupt change point. This is an extension work of Shao, Li, and Cheng (in press) which first introduced the CPA method to detect test speededness with known item parameters. Following this line of research, three studies are carried out.    The first study investigates whether CPA can help improve item calibration in the presence of speededness. In this study, the CPA method is used to first detect speeded responses with unknown item parameters. After the detection of speeded examinees as well as their corresponding speeding point (the point at which an examinee starts to speed), a cleansing procedure based upon the detected speeding point is proposed to help improve item parameter estimation. The performance of speededness detection as well as the item parameter recovery before/after utilizing the cleansing procedure are evaluated.    The second study applies the CPA method to warm-up effect detection. This study first compares the impact of warm-up effect on ability estimation and examinees' classification accuracy on two types of tests: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Paper and Pencil (linear) Testing. In the second step, the CPA based detection of warm-up effect is carried out. Two methods of obtaining the critical values are utilized in the study.    Different from the first two studies which both conduct CPA using item response information, the third study applies CPA to response time data in speededness detection. A gradual change log-normal model is proposed to better model the real-life change of response time affected by speededness. Two test statistics are introduced to test for a change point using response time. Moreover, this study explores the possibility of using a fixed critical value across conditions at each nominal level so that practitioners do not have to obtain a critical value through simulation every time they run speededness detection.    The dissertation thesis concludes with the final chapter including a discussion of the results, limitations, practical implications, and future directions.

T1  - Development and validation of a computerized-adaptive test for PTSD (P-CAT)
AN  - 1935255325; 48556
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes >.90). The P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may be a viable and efficient assessment method.

T1  - Investigating Robustness of Item Response Theory Proficiency Estimators to Atypical Response Behaviors under Two-Stage Multistage Testing. ETS GRE® Board Research Report. ETS GRE®-16-03. ETS Research Report No. RR-16-22
AN  - 1895976126; EJ1124833
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which item response theory (IRT) proficiency estimation methods are robust to the presence of aberrant responses under the "GRE"® General Test multistage adaptive testing (MST) design. To that end, a wide range of atypical response behaviors affecting as much as 10% of the test items were simulated using a generic GRE 2-stage MST and the 2-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model. As expected, some differences were found among the 5 estimators in terms of the recovery of the true theta ability; for example, Bayesian estimators had lower error variance and their estimates were regressed to the mean.Once the IRT theta estimates were scaled onto a comparable reporting score scale, however, it was found that all the estimation methods investigated, including the one currently used to score GRE MSTs, were equally robust under the simulated conditions.

T1  - Improving Binary Classifier Performance Through an Informed Sampling Approach and Imputation

AB  - In the last two decades or so, some of the substantial advances in machine learning relate to sampling techniques. For example, boosting uses weighted sampling to improve model training, and active learning uses unlabeled data gathered so far to decide what are the most relevant data points to ask an oracle to label. This thesis introduces a novel sampling technique that uses features entropy to guide the sampling, a process we call  informed sampling. The central idea is that the reliability of model parameter learning may be more sensitive to variables that have low, or high entropy. Therefore, adapting the sampling rate of variables based on their entropy may lead to better parameter estimates.    In a series of papers, we first test this hypothesis for three classifier models, Logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and over a binary classification task with a 0–1 loss function. The results show that the high-entropy sampling (higher sampling rate for high entropy variables) systematically improves the prediction performance of the TAN classifier. However, for the NB and LR classifiers, the picture is more blurry. Improvements are obtained for only half of the 11 datasets used, and often the improvements come from high-entropy sampling, seldom from low-entropy sampling. This first experiment is replicated in a second study, this time using a more realistic context where the entropy of variables is unknown a priori, but instead is estimated with seed data and adjusted on the fly. Results showed that using a seed dataset of 1% of the total number of instances, which ranged from a few hundreds to around 1000, the improvements obtained from the former study hold for TAN with an average improvement of 13% in RMSE reduction. For the same seed size improvements were also obtained for the Naive Bayes classifier by a factor of 8% from low instead of high entropy sampling. Also, the pattern of improvements for LR was almost the same as obtained from the former study.    Notwithstanding that classifier improvements can be obtained through informed sampling, but that the pattern of improvements varies across the informed sampling approach and the classifier model, we further investigate how the imputation methods affect this pattern. This question is of high importance because informed sampling necessarily implies missing values, and many classifiers either require the imputation of missing values, or can be improved by imputation. Therefore imputation and informative sampling are likely to be combined in practice. The obvious question is whether the gains obtained from each are additive or if they relate in a more complex manner.    The gain from imputation methods are first studied in isolation with a comparative analysis of the performance of some new and some well known imputation algorithms, with the objective of determining to which extent the pattern of improvements is stable across classifiers for the binary classification and 0–1 loss function. Here too, results show that patterns of improvement of imputation algorithms can vary substantially per model and also per missing value rate. We also investigate the improvements along a different dimension which is whether the rate of sampling per record is stable or varies. Minor, but statistically significant differences are observed in the results, showing that this dimension can also affect classifier performance.    In a final paper, first the levels of improvement from informed sampling are compared with those from a number of imputation techniques. Next, we empirically investigate whether the gains obtained from sampling and imputation are additive, or they combine in a more complex manner. The results show that the individual gains from informed sampling and imputation are within the same range and that combining high-entropy informed sampling with imputation brings significant gains to the classifiers' performance, but generally, not as a simple sum of the individual improvements. It is also noteworthy that despite the encouraging results for some combinations of informed sampling and imputation algorithms, detailed analysis of individual dataset results reveals that these combinations rarely bring classification performance above the top imputation algorithms or informed sampling by themselves.    The results of our studies provide evidence of the effectiveness of informed sampling to improve the binary classification performance of the TAN model. Also, high-entropy sampling is shown to be the most preferable scheme to be conducted. This for example, in the context of Computerized Adaptive Testing, can be translated to favoring the highly uncertain questions (items of average difficulty). Variable number of items administered is another factor that should be taken into account when imputation is involved.  Alternative Kurzfassung:Au cours des deux dernières décennies, des progrès importants dans le domaine de l'apprentissage automatique ont été réalisés grâce à des techniques d'échantillonnage. Relevons par exemple le renforcement (boosting), une technique qui assigne des poids aux observations pour améliorer l'entraînement du modèle, ainsi que la technique d'apprentissage actif qui utilise des données non étiquetées partielles pour décider dynamiquement quels cas sont les plus pertinents à demander à un oracle d'étiqueter.Cette thèse s'inscrit dans ces recherches et présente une nouvelle technique d'échantillonnage qui utilise l'entropie des données pour guider l'échantillonnage, un processus que nous appelons l'échantillonnage informé. L'idée centrale est que la fiabilité de l'estimation des paramètres d'un modèle peut dépendre de l'entropie des variables. Donc, l'adaptation du taux d'échantillonnage de variables basée sur leur entropie peut conduire à de meilleures estimations des paramètres.Dans une série d'articles, nous étudions cette hypothèse pour trois modèles de classification, notamment Régression Logistique (LR), le modèle bayes naïf (NB) et le modèle d'arbre bayes naif (TAN—Tree Augmented Naive Bayes), en prenant une tâche de classification binaire avec une fonction d'erreur 0–1. Les résultats démontrent que l'échantillonnage d'entropie élevée (taux d'échantillonnage plus élevé pour les variables d'entropie élevée) améliore systématiquement les performances de prédiction du classificateur TAN. Toutefois, pour les classificateurs NB et LR, les résultats ne sont pas concluants. Des améliorations sont obtenues pour seulement la moitié des 11 ensembles de données utilisées et souvent les améliorations proviennent de l'échantillonnage à entropie élevée, rarement de l'échantillonnage à entropie faible.Cette première expérience est reproduite dans une deuxième étude, cette fois en utilisant un contexte plus réaliste où l'entropie des variables est inconnue à priori, mais plutôt estimée avec des données initiales et où l'échantillonnage est ajusté à la volée avec les nouvelles estimation de l'entropie.Les résultats démontrent qu'avec l'utilisation d'un ensemble de données initial de 1% du nombre total des exemplaires, qui variait de quelques centaines à environ 1000, les gains obtenus de l'étude précédente persistent pour le modèle TAN avec une amélioration moyenne de 13% dans la réduction l'erreur quadratique. Pour la même taille des semences, des améliorations ont également été obtenues pour le classificateur naïf bayésien par un facteur de 8% de l'entropie faible au lieu d'échantillonnage d'entropie élevée.L'échantillonnage informé implique nécessairement des valeurs manquantes, et de nombreux classificateurs nécessitent soit l'imputation des valeurs manquantes, ou peuvent être améliorés par imputation. Par conséquent, l'imputation et l'échantillonnage informatif sont susceptibles d'être combinés dans la pratique. La question évidente est de savoir si les gains obtenus de chacun sont additifs ou s'ils se rapportent d'une manière plus complexe. Nous étudions dans un premier temps comment les méthodes d'imputation affectent la performance des classificateurs puis si la combinaison de techniques d'imputation avec l'échantillonnage informé apporte des gains qui se cumulent.Le gain de méthodes d'imputation sont d'abord étudiés isolément avec une analyse comparative de la performance de certains nouveaux algorithmes et d'autres algorithmes d'imputation bien connus avec l'objectif de déterminer dans quelle mesure le motif des améliorations est stable dans les classificateurs pour la classification binaire. Ici encore, les résultats montrent que les améliorations obtenues par des techniques d'imputation peuvent varier considérablement par modèle et aussi par taux de valeur manquante. Nous étudions également les améliorations le long d'une autre dimension qui est de savoir si le taux d'échantillonnage par enregistrement est stable ou varie. Des différences mineures, mais statistiquement significatives sont observées dans les résultats, montrant que cette dimension peut également affecter les performances du classificateur.Dans une dernière étude, nous étudions empiriquement si les gains obtenus de l'échantillonnage informé et de l'imputation sont additifs, ou s'ils se combinent d'une manière plus complexe. Les résultats montrent que les gains individuels de l'échantillonnage informé et d'imputation sont du même ordre de grandeur, mais en général, ils ne sont pas une simple somme des améliorations individuelles. Il faut noter aussi que, malgré les résultats encourageants pour certaines combinaisons d'échantillonnage informées et des algorithmes d'imputation, une analyse détaillée des résultats de l'ensemble de données individuelles révèle que ces combinaisons apportent rarement des performances supérieures aux algorithmes d'imputation ou à l'échantillonnage informé individuellement.Les résultats de nos études fournissent une démonstration de l'efficacité de l'échantillonnage informé pour améliorer les performances de classification binaire pour le modèle TAN, mais les résultats sont plus mitigés pour NB et LR. En outre, l'échantillonnage à entropie élevée se révèle être le régime le plus bénéfique.

T1  - Methods for Hypothesis Testing in Animal Carcinogenicity Experiments
AN  - 1830448193
AB  - Animal carcinogenicity experiments are conducted by private entities and government agencies to investigate whether a substance causes cancer. Since most tumors are occult and it is necessary to conduct a necropsy to detect the presence of cancer, producing unbiased tests for differences in tumor incidence is challenging. The highest doses given in these experiments often have toxic effects in the animals or might affect tumor lethality, and many common statistical methods for survival data perform poorly when such effects induce differences in mortality across treatment groups. The poly- k test, developed by Bailer & Portier (1988) as a modification of the Cochran-Armitage test, was designed to avoid problems from differential mortality, but is based on strong parametric assumptions, specifically that underlying tumor hazard may be modeled as Weibull with shape parameter  k (usually set to 3). Existing literature that examines the performance of the poly-k and competitor tests assumes Weibull tumor hazards, and finds that the poly-k can be biased under treatment toxicity when its shape parameter assumption is not met. Given that this test has become a standard for government agencies such as the National Toxicology Program and the FDA, closer examination is warranted. Our simulations examine the performance of the poly-k under non-Weibull tumor hazards, and find that our own parametric tests can outperform it under these conditions. For tests like the poly-k, our goal is to develop and examine the performance of adaptive testing algorithms that estimate a test's parameter based on the data; one such estimation was suggested under Weibull assumptions by Moon et al. (2003), though their approach based on estimating lifetime cumulative tumor incidence rates does not make full use of the available data, and requires that the experiment include multiple interim sacrifices for adequate performance. Under most of our simulation settings, our kˆ MLE test, based on estimating the shape parameter  k by maximizing the full likelihood, has type I error and power very similar to the poly-k test with correctly-specified  k, and it maintains size better, with comparable or higher power, than the test based on the Moon et al. estimate. Our MLE-based test does not require interim sacrifices, although it may perform better under some interim sacrifice experimental designs. We compare these tests under a variety of parametric assumptions and serial sacrifice designs to examine which experimental settings are most optimal for test performance.

T1  - Non-parametric item response theory applications in the assessment of dementia
AN  - 1857763144
AB  - This thesis sought to address the application of non-parametric item response theory (NIRT) to cognitive and functional assessment in dementia. Performance on psychometric tests is key to diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. NIRT can be used to improve the psychometric properties of tests used in dementia assessment in multiple ways: confirming an underlying unidimensional structure, establishing formal item hierarchical patterns of decline, increasing insight by examining item parameters such as difficulty and discrimination, and creating shorter tests. From a NIRT approach item difficulty refers to the ease with which an item is endorsed. Discrimination is an index of how well an item can differentiate between patients of varying levels of severity. Firstly I carried out a systematic review to identify applications of both parametric and non-parametric IRT to measures assessing global cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This review demonstrated that IRT can increase the interpretive power of cognitive assessment scales and confirmed the limited number of IRT analyses of cognitive scales in dementia populations. This thesis extended this approach by applying Mokken scaling analysis to commonly used measures of current cognitive ability (Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)) and of premorbid cognitive ability (National Adult Reading Test (NART)). Differential item functioning (DIF) by diagnosis identified slight variations in the patterns of hierarchical decline in the ACE-R. These disease-specific sequences of decline could serve as an adjunct to diagnosis, for example where learning a name and address is a more difficult task than being orientated in time, late onset Alzheimer’s disease is a more probable diagnosis than mixed Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. These analyses also allowed key items to be identified which can be used to create briefer scales (mini-ACE and Mini-NART) which have good psychometric properties. These scales are clinically relevant, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items. They also allow sensitive measurement and adaptive testing and can reduce test administration time and patient stress. Impairment of functional abilities represents a crucial component of dementia diagnosis with performance on these functional tasks predictive of overall disease. A second aspect of this thesis, therefore, was the application of Mokken scaling analyses to measures of functional decline in dementia, specifically the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS). While gender DIF was observed for several items, implying the likelihood of equal responses from men and women is not equal a generally consistent pattern of impairment in functional ability was observed across different types of dementia.

T1  - Recent stress history effects in clays and associated improvements to the brick model
AN  - 1827521410
AB  - It is known that the stiffness of many soils is higher at small strains than at the large strains used in typical triaxial testing. Understanding this initial high stiffness and the factors affecting it is key to accurate displacement predictions. The recent stress history (RSH) effect describes how the stiffness degradation curve at small strains is affected by the immediately preceding stress path. The effect is usually described in terms of stress path rotation angle between an approach path and the shear probe upon which stiffness degradation is measured. The principle aim of the work was to investigate the relationship between the RSH effect, approach path length, and time dependent effects in more detail. A combination of physical testing and simulations with the BRICK constitutive model were used to achieve this. This has shown that in multistage testing the residual RSH effect from the first test increased the stiffness exhibited in the second, thus masking the natural behaviour. In addition the stress path rotation from consolidation to testing caused a stiffness reduction in the first test. This effect, newly termed recent consolidation history (RCH), was found to be degraded by the first test and so did not impact on the second. When allowance was made for these effects trends seen in the literature were supported. Due to the complex stress paths used in the physical testing, a number of improvements were required to the strain rate dependent (SRD) BRICK model to allow accurate simulations to be run. These included implementation of a bisecting iteration within the strain calculations, and a coordinate decent routine to allow creep and creep rupture to be modelled. The model was then used to simulate the physical tests to allow more insight into the interplay between the effects identified in the physical testing, ultimately supporting the conclusions drawn.

T1  - New group testing paradigms: From practice to theory
AN  - 1751005379
AB  - We propose a novel group testing framework, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome screening experiments in addition to other applications such as interpretable rule learning for decision making. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an integer-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a unifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing models are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the notion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable test matrices, representing generalizations of classical disjunct and separable matrices. We describe combinatorial and probabilistic constructions for such matrices without considering any restriction on the thresholds of the SQGT model (i.e. SQGT with arbitrary thresholds). Then, we focus on the important special case in which the thresholds are equidistant, and construct SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable matrices for this model. While for most of the constructions described in this dissertation, it is assumed that the number of defectives is much smaller than total number of test subjects, we also consider the case in which there is no restriction on the number of defectives and they may be as large as the total number of subjects. For the constructed matrices, we describe a number of efficient decoding algorithms based on algebraic methods and message passing on graphical models. Finally, we introduce the novel probabilistic group testing framework of Poisson group testing, applicable to dynamic testing with diminishing relative rates of defectives. For this new model, we consider both nonadaptive and adaptive testing schemes and develop lower bounds and tight constructive upper bounds on the number of required tests.

T1  - Comparing the Effect of Two Types of Computer Screen Background Lighting on Students' Reading Engagement and Achievement
AN  - 1650526779; 201500650
AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

T1  - Validation of the depression item bank from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(TM)) in a three-month observational study
AN  - 1558993257; 201431254
AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(TM)) is an NIH Roadmap initiative devoted to developing better measurement tools for assessing constructs relevant to the clinical investigation and treatment of all diseases-constructs such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, sleep, physical functioning, and social participation. Following creation of item banks for these constructs, our priority has been to validate them, most often in short-term observational studies. We report here on a three-month prospective observational study with depressed outpatients in the early stages of a new treatment episode (with assessments at intake, one-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up). The protocol was designed to compare the psychometric properties of the PROMIS depression item bank (administered as a computerized adaptive test, CAT) with two legacy self-report instruments: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999). PROMIS depression demonstrated strong convergent validity with the CESD and the PHQ-9 (with correlations in a range from .72 to .84 across all time points), as well as responsiveness to change when characterizing symptom severity in a clinical outpatient sample. Identification of patients as 'recovered' varied across the measures, with the PHQ-9 being the most conservative. The use of calibrations based on models from item response theory (IRT) provides advantages for PROMIS depression both psychometrically (creating the possibility of adaptive testing, providing a broader effective range of measurement, and generating greater precision) and practically (these psychometric advantages can be achieved with fewer items-a median of 4 items administered by CAT-resulting in less patient burden).

T1  - Portuguese-language cultural adaptation of the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
AN  - 1692279184; 201507261
AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), structured in Itens Banks, provides a new tool for evaluating results that apply to various chronic diseases through advanced statistical techniques (TRI) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The aim of this study was to culturally adapt the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of PROMIS to the Portuguese language. The process followed the recommendations of PROMIS through the advanced translation, reconciliation, back-translation, FACIT review, independent review, finalization, pre-test, and incorporation of the results from the pre-test. The translated version was pre-tested in ten patients, and items 3, 46, and 53 of the Bank of Anxiety and item 46 of the bank of Depression had to be changed. Changes affected equivalence of meaning, and the final version was consistent with the Brazilian population's linguistic and cultural skills. In conclusion, for the Brazilian population the translated version proved semantically and conceptually equivalent to the original. Adapted from the source document

T1  - Deep massage to posterior calf muscles in combination with neural mobilization exercises as a treatment for heel pain: A pilot randomized clinical trial
AN  - 1680436212; 20064139
AB  - Background: Plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS) is a common foot disorder; however, there is limited clinical evidence on which to base treatment. Repeated clinical observations indicating heel pain during heel rise and minisquat on the affected leg, involving activation of posterior calf muscles, formed the basis of this study. Objective: To compare deep massage therapy to posterior calf muscles and neural mobilization with a self-stretch exercise program (DMS) to a common treatment protocol of ultrasound therapy to the painful heel area with the same self-stretch exercises (USS). Methods: Patients with PHPS were assigned to a program of 8 treatments over a period of 4-6 weeks in a single-blind randomized clinical trial. Functional status (FS) at admission and discharge from therapy as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was the main outcome measure. Results: Sixty-nine patients were included in the trial (mean age 53, standard deviation (SD) 13, range 25-86, 57% women), 36 received DMS treatment and 33 with USS. The overall group-by-time interaction for the mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was found statistically significant (p = 0.034), with a change of (mean (confidence interval, CI)) 15 (9-21) and 6 (1-11) FS points for the DMS and USS groups, respectively. Conclusions: Data indicated that both treatment protocols resulted in an overall short-term improvement, however, DMS treatment was significantly more effective in treating PHPS than USS treatment.

T1  - The EORTC emotional functioning computerized adaptive test: phases I-III of a cross-cultural item bank development
AN  - 1531918641; 201413633
AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

T1  - Comparing the Effect of Two Types of Computer Screen Background Lighting on Students' Reading Engagement and Achievement
AN  - 1871572088; ED568528
AB  - With increased dependence on computer-based standardized tests to assess academic achievement, technological literacy has become an essential skill. Yet, because students have unequal access to technology, they may not have equal opportunities to perform well on these computer-based tests. The researcher had observed students taking the STAR Reading test (Renaissance Learning, 2009) and noticed a variance in scores in relation to classroom performance. The researcher intended, therefore, to explore variables that may affect the performance of students on a computer-based reading assessment. The researcher tested two different technology-related variables as students took a summative exam, the STAR Reading test. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in visual stimuli affected the process of reading and student reading behavior. This quantitative study sought to ascertain whether changing the computer read-out to a black screen with white lettering made a difference in student engagement and comprehension among students in grades two through six during a computer-based adaptive test. The research site was one K-6 elementary school in a large suburban school district. The participants of the study were 316 children in grades two through six. One hundred and sixteen students were randomly sampled for student engagement data analysis. The researcher conducted a stratified random process to further select data for analysis. Students were exposed to both color display background variables throughout the study process. Teacher observers collected tallies on student engagement behaviors during the test-taking process. The researcher calculated the mean level of student engagement on each of five observed behaviors. The researcher also collected reading comprehension data for five subsequent benchmark sessions throughout the year. The engagement results of this study failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that elementary student behaviors during testing would verify a measureable difference in engagement when either a black or white display screen was presented. The results of the reading comprehension test also failed to support the hypothesis, which stated that there would be a measureable difference in elementary students' scores while taking computer-based tests when the computer screen was set to either black or white background.

T1  - Designing <i>p</i>-Optimal Item Pools for Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 1615091454
AB  - The interest in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has grown considerably over the last few years. While a significant amount of research has been conducted on item selection and ability estimation methods for MCAT, few studies specifically addressed the item pool design for MCAT. To ensure a proper functioning of MCAT, a well-designed item pool is imperative. A well-designed item pool should consist of a number of well-balanced items that achieve appropriate test precision, item usage, as well as lower the cost of item creation. One method to develop such an item pool is the  p-optimality method, which is proposed by Reckase (2003 & 2007) for unidimensional CAT. This paper aims to develop p-optimal item pools for MCAT by extending the Reckase's method to a multidimensional context.   The extension includes the generation of a multidimensional optimal item based on the D-Optimality item selection creation, the definition of the MDIFF-bin to describe multidimensional item succinctly for item pool design, and the interpretation for the p-optimal item pool in a multidimensional context. In this paper, a total of 24 p-optimal item pools were designed and then developed for different test specification, with different correlation among dimensions, based on different bin size, and under the condition with or without item exposure control. The characteristics for the 24  p-optimal item pools are summarized. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the p-optimal item pools against baseline pools existing in research literature.   Results show that p-optimal item pools achieve similar levels of measurement accuracy as baseline pools, but they consist of fewer items and perform better in terms of item pool usage and test security. The characteristics and the performance of the p-optimal item pools are affected by factors such as test specification, correlation among dimensions, bin size, and item exposure control. The results in this study can provide a general guideline for the item pool development for MCAT. More importantly, because the p-optimal item pool is specifically tailored to the MCAT programs, the p-optimal item pool design procedure described in this study can be adapted to other MCAT programs with different features and purposes. The end product of the p-optimal item pool design can be used as an instructive guide for item creation, item pool development, and item pool management.

T1  - Student Perceptions of Barriers to Success on the Nursing Exit Exam
AN  - 1566941687
AB  - Nursing programs increasingly use exit exams to increase graduating nursing students' readiness for the nurse licensing examination. These exams prepare students for computer adaptive testing and identify areas where remediation is needed. This study examines an Associate Degree in Nursing program that has shown consistently low exit exam scores causing delays in student graduation, eligibility to sit for the licensing exam, and entry into the workforce. The study was crafted to investigate student perspectives of the barriers to student success on the Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) exit exam. It employed a quantitative one-shot survey design to evaluate factors related to performance on the HESI exit exam, including lack of study time, lack of knowledge despite passing nursing courses, lack of motivation to prepare for the exam, overwhelming stress, poor test-taking skills, and lack of confidence. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that students' self-perceptions of poor test-taking skills had a significant negative effect on HESI exit exam scores. These findings were used to design a project focused on teaching test-taking skills throughout the nursing program. The study and project collectively promote positive social change by providing a means to improve nursing program graduation rates, a tool of great importance in addressing the current shortage of nurses in the United States' workforce.

T1  - Statistical Methods in Genetic Association Studies and a Genetic Risk Score for Predictive Modeling of Disease Risk: from Gene Discovery to Translation
AN  - 1554331595
AB  - Fueled by rapid technological and methodological development, research in the area of genetic epidemiology has brought many successes as well as analytical challenges in identification of genetic risk factors for disease risk. Many have predicted that the detection of heritable disease susceptibility variants could eventually lead to stable models for prediction of disease risk. This dissertation is devoted to the statistical methodological consideration and development in genetic association studies, as well as the use of weighted genetic risk score in predictive modeling of disease risk.   We begin the work by reviewing a brief background into genetic association studies, predictive modeling and relevant analytic challenges. In Chapter 2, we discuss the theoretical relationship between classical multiple linear regression (MLR) and two-stage residual-outcome regression analysis (2SR) in terms of confounding adjustment. We demonstrate that the 2SR would introduce bias and loss of power in the presence of confounding, and thus remind researchers to be cautious in applying the 2SR in genetic association studies. In Chapter 3, we propose an adaptive permutation procedure in testing the significance of susceptibility genetic variants. Results show that the adaptive test is statistically valid as well as computationally feasible in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recommendations are made for the implementation of adaptive permutation in real studies. In Chapter 4, we develop an explained-variance based genetic risk score (GRS) for predictive modeling of disease risk. Extensive simulation studies suggest that this new weighted GRS is a robust risk score approach that consistently outperforms simple count and odds ratio based GRS approaches. In Chapter 5, we further explore the performance of GRS approaches in the presence of interactions, including statistical interaction, dependence and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results emphasize the advantage of weighted GRS even in more complicated settings, motivating its application in predictive modeling. This work concludes with several practical guidelines in genetic association studies and predictive modeling, and discussions of future perspectives.

T1  - Employing Online S-P Diagnostic Table for Qualitative Comments on Test Results
AN  - 1509087439; EJ1016233
AB  - The major concerns of adaptive testing studies have concentrated on effectiveness and efficiency of the system built for the research experiments. It has been criticised that such general information has fallen short of providing qualitative descriptions regarding learning performance. Takahiro Sato of Japan proposed an analytical diagram called Student-Problem Chart (S-P Chart) in the 1970. The S-P Chart is able to establish a learning diagnostic table which comments student learning performance in a verbal form. The advancement of computer technology has made the S-P analytical process more applicable for school teachers. This study examined how online comments provided by the S-P diagnostic table could affect the students' learning attitude. One hundred sixth grade students were selected to be the subjects of the study. An online embedded test was given to the subjects and an S-P diagnostic table was drawn by the computer to display instant comments on each student's learning performance. A Questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews were performed after the experiment. Results indicated that students liked the online qualitative comments. This is because students were able to instantly understand why they performed well/poor in the test, which is much beyond the numerical scores can explain. The results also showed that the online S-P diagnostic table made students more circumspect on answering the test questions in order to reduce careless mistakes. Students would also be more likely to review what they missed on the test. However, the S-P comment table seemed to have no effect on improving their learning performance. An online iterative drilling platform was consequently built to incorporate with the S-P diagnostic process to assist poorly performed students. It may effectively work with the S-P diagnostic process to provide constructive remediation for the students who exhibited a poor performance on the S-P chart.

T1  - A Mixture Rasch Model-Based Computerized Adaptive Test for Latent Class Identification
AN  - 1037907830; EJ974723
AB  - This study explored a computerized adaptive test delivery algorithm for latent class identification based on the mixture Rasch model. Four item selection methods based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information were proposed and compared with the reversed and the adaptive KL information under simulated testing conditions. When item separation was large, all item selection methods did not differ evidently in terms of accuracy in classifying examinees into different latent classes and estimating latent ability. However, when item separation was small, two methods with class-specific ability estimates performed better than the other two methods based on a single latent ability estimate across all latent classes. The three types of KL information distributions were compared. The KL and the reversed KL information could be the same or different depending on the ability level and the item difficulty difference between latent classes. Although the KL information and the reversed KL information were different at some ability levels and item difficulty difference levels, the use of the KL, the reversed KL, or the adaptive KL information did not affect the results substantially due to the symmetric distribution of item difficulty differences between latent classes in the simulated item pools. Item pool usage and classification convergence points were examined as well. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

T1  - Influence of Fear-Avoidance Beliefs on Functional Status Outcomes for People With Musculoskeletal Conditions of the Shoulder
AN  - 1038598234; 17085261
AB  - The influence of elevated fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of fearavoidance on recovery of functional status during rehabilitation for people with shoulder impairments. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted. Data were collected from 3,362 people with musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder receiving rehabilitation. At intake and discharge, upperextremity function was measured using the shoulder Computerized Adaptive Test. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale. Completion rate at discharge was 57% for function and 47% for pain intensity. A single-item screen was used to classify patients into groups with low versus elevated fear-avoidance beliefs at intake. A general linear model (GLM) was used to describe how change in function is affected by fear avoidance in 8 disease categories. This study also accounted for within-clinic correlation and controlled for other important predictors of functional change in functional status, including various demographic and healthrelated variables. The parameters of the GLM and their standard errors were estimated with the weighted generalized estimating equations method. Functional change was predicted by the interaction between fear and disease categories. On further examination of 8 disease categories using GLM adjusted for other confounders, improvement in function was greater for the low fear group than for the elevated fear group among people with muscle, tendon, and softtissue disorders ( delta =1.37, P <.01) and those with osteopathies, chondropathies, and acquired musculoskeletal deformities ( delta =5.52, P<.02). These differences were below the minimal detectable change. Information was not available on whether therapists used information on level of fear to implement treatment plans. The influence of fear-avoidance beliefs on change in functional status varies among specific shoulder impairments.

T1  - A computerized adaptive version of the SF-36 is feasible for clinic and Internet administration in adults with HIV
AN  - 1283739985; 201301875
AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N=100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N=101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A New Approach to the Measurement of Adaptive Behavior: Development of the PEDI-CAT for Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 1018479370; EJ964543
AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. (Contains 3 tables.)

T1  - A New Approach to the Measurement of Adaptive Behavior: Development of the PEDI-CAT for Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 1010709080; 201208761
AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An empirical examination of the impact of item parameters on IRT information functions in mixed format tests
AN  - 928069566
AB  - IRT, also referred as “modern test theory”, offers many advantages over CTT-based methods in test development. Specifically, an IRT information function has the capability to build a test that has the desired precision of measurement for any defined proficiency scale when a sufficient number of test items are available. This feature is extremely useful when the information is used for decision making, for instance, whether an examinee attain certain mastery level. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is one of the many examples using IRT information functions in test construction.    The purposes of this study were as follows: (1) to examine the consequences of improving the test quality through the addition of more discriminating items with different item formats; (2) to examine the effect of having a test where its difficulty does not align with the ability level of the intended population; (3) to investigate the change in decision consistency and decision accuracy; and (4) to understand changes in expected information when test quality is either improved or degraded, using both empirical and simulated data.   Main findings from the study were as follows: (1) increasing the discriminating power of any types of items generally increased the level of information; however, sometimes it could bring adverse effect to the extreme ends of the ability continuum; (2) it was important to have more items that were targeted at the population of interest, otherwise, no matter how good the quality of the items may be, they were of less value in test development when they were not targeted to the distribution of candidate ability or at the cutscores; (3) decision consistency (DC), Kappa statistic, and decision accuracy (DA) increased with better quality items; (4) DC and  Kappa were negatively affected when difficulty of the test did not match with the ability of the intended population; however, the effect was less severe if the test was easier than needed; (5) tests with more better quality items lowered false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rate at the cutscores; (6) when test difficulty did not match with the ability of the target examinees, in general, both FP and FN rates increased; (7) polytomous items tended to yield more information than dichotomously scored items, regardless of the discriminating parameter and difficulty of the item; and (8) the more score categories an item had, the more information it could provide.   Findings from this thesis should help testing agencies and practitioners to have better understanding of the item parameters on item and test information functions. This understanding is crucial for the improvement of the item bank quality and ultimately on how to build better tests that could provide more accurate proficiency classifications. However, at the same time, item writers should be conscientious about the fact that the item information function is merely a statistical tool for building a good test, other criteria should also be considered, for example, content balancing and content validity.

T1  - Feedback type as a moderator of the relationship between achievement goals and feedback reactions
AN  - 925739821; 201203528
AB  - The aim of the current study is to shed new light on the inconsistent relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining feedback type as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task? showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by feedback type. Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and feedback type also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used in a wide range of human resource and performance management instruments (e.g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/360 degree feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees' reactions and rate of performance improvement.

T1  - Potential Impact of Context Effects on the Scoring and Equating of the Multistage GRE® Revised General Test. ETS GRE® Board Research Report. ETS GRE® GREB-08-01. ETS Research Report. RR-11-26
AN  - 1871579900; EJ1110374
AB  - Both theoretical and practical considerations have led the revision of the Graduate Record Examinations® (GRE®) revised General Test, here called the rGRE, to adopt a multistage adaptive design that will be continuously or nearly continuously administered and that can provide immediate score reporting. These circumstances sharply constrain the available options for equating or linking together the thousands of unique test forms that will need to be administered each year. The only practical method is to pre-equate each form through item response theory (IRT) methods. Unfortunately, doing so means that item position and context effects are both vitally important and potentially difficult to control. This study examines item position effects in a GRE context and attempts to assess the extent to which they may affect the rGRE. It was found that position effects are in fact present in GRE data and that they can be particularly troublesome under multistage testing. Pretest strategies are able to mitigate effects to some degree, but complete control will require careful attention be paid to the time limits and associated test configuration details in the design of the rGRE.

T1  - Controlling IC Quality through Diagnosis Based Adaptive Test
AN  - 897694545
AB  - The main purpose of manufacturing test has been and continues to be to separate good integrated circuits (ICs) from ones that do not meet the desired operational characteristics. An ideal testing procedure should pass all good chips and fail all those that do not deliver the required functionality. However, a defective chip may pass all the tests, which leads to reduction in product quality. Product quality is commonly measured using defect level, which is the ratio of defective chips in all the chips that pass all tests. Defect level is typically expressed in units of defective parts per million shipped (DPPM). A variety of test sets derived using different test metrics are usually applied to ensure an acceptable quality level. However, various experiments involving actual ICs have shown that a significant portion of the test patterns applied do not contribute to the improvement in product quality, which indicates the possibility of significantly reducing the cost of test without affecting product quality, or alternatively improving product quality without incurring additional test cost.    In this dissertation, a diagnosis-assisted adaptive test (DAT) method for improving test quality is described, developed, and validated. DAT uses diagnosis to capture the failure characteristics on a per-design basis and improves test quality by changing the test set to match the current failure characteristics. DAT uses (i) a multiple defect diagnosis method, referred to as MD2X, which is flexible in handling various defect behaviors, and (ii) a failing behavior identification (FBI) method that captures defect behavior by identifying signal lines related to defect activation.    MD2X is evaluated using logic simulation experiments. Results from over 5,700 simulated and 131 failing ICs show that MD 2X can effectively diagnose circuits that are affected by a large (>20) or small number of defects of various types. Specifically, when diagnosing circuits with more than 20 defects, MD2X identifies 74% of them. For circuits affected by two defects, the number changes to 87%. This level of diagnosis accuracy for ICs of this type exceeds all claims currently found in the literature.    The efficacy of FBI is validated using circuit- and logic-level simulation experiments. The results show that FBI achieves an average accuracy of 94% in identifying signal lines that are relevant to defect activation, a 28% improvement over prior art.    DAT is validated using circuit-level simulation experiments and experiments involving real IC fail data. Circuit-level simulation involving various types of defects shows that defect level can be reduced by 30% using DAT. In addition, a new cost-efficient framework for evaluating test quality using tester data from failing ICs, which we call FETQ, has also been developed. FETQ is used to evaluate the quality of tests based on DAT. Among the test sets of the same size, the test set generated using DAT detects the most failing chips, and it uniquely fails one defective chip that is not detected by any of the test sets that are generated based on stuck-at, bridge, and input-pattern fault models. The test quality of DAT test sets is also compared with the original one used in production. The result shows that DAT test sets detect more failing chips with the same number of test patterns, or alternatively, the same number of failing chips could be detected using significantly fewer tests.

T1  - Adaptive Architectures for Robust and Efficient Computing
AN  - 896357604
AB  - Semiconductor technology scaling has long been a source of dramatic gains in our computing capabilities. However, as we test the physical limits of silicon feature size, serious reliability and computational efficiency challenges confront us. The supply voltage levels have practically stagnated, resulting in increasing power densities and operating temperatures. Given that most semiconductor wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Further, the rise in power density is also limiting the number of resources that can be kept active on chip simultaneously, motivating the need for energy-efficient computing.    In this landscape of technological challenges, incremental architectural improvements to existing designs are likely insufficient, motivating a need to rethink the architectural fabric from the ground up. Towards this end, this thesis presents adaptive architecture and compiler solutions that can effectively tackle reliability, performance and energy-efficiency demands expected in future microprocessors.    For the reliability challenge, we present StageNet, a highly reconfigurable multicore architecture that is designed as a network of pipeline stages, rather than isolated cores. The interconnection flexibility in StageNet allows it to adaptively route around defective pieces of a processor, and deliver graceful performance degradation in the face of failures. We further complement the fault isolation ability of StageNet with an adaptive testing framework that significantly reduces the overhead of in-field fault detection.    As a second contribution, we build upon the interconnection flexibility of StageNet to develop a unified performance-reliability solution. This subsequent design, named CoreGenesis, relies on a set of microarchitectural innovations and compiler hints to merge processor cores for a higher single-thread performance. This enables customization of processing ability (narrow or wide-issue pipelines) to the dynamic workload requirements.    In the final work of this thesis, we investigate the sources of computational inefficiency in general purpose processors, and propose a configurable compute engine, named BERET, for substantial energy savings. The insight here is to cut down on the redundant instruction fetch, decode and register file access energy by optimizing the execution of recurring instruction sequences.

T1  - Development of the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument: A Sequential Exploratory Mixed Methods Design
AN  - 1123912459
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that commonly manifests in the feet as pain, swelling and deformity. These symptoms often have extensive and severe mutlidimensional consequences for people's lives and can be evaluated using a class of subjective outcome measures known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs have been advocated by the Darzi report and are central to reforms in the NHS.Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a new and novel PROM, the Salford Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Evaluation Instrument (SAFE), using a clinimetric approach and featuring an adequately pre-tested nomothetic (fixed scale) and idiographic (patient-specific scale) assessment strategy. A mixed methods approach was employed to develop the SAFE, with the formulation and implementation of a four phase sequential exploratory fully mixed methods design (SEMMD) that featured equal priority between the qualitative and quantitative components.The four phase SEMMD enabled the strategic and effective combination of methods to produce a PROM that is firmly rooted in the views and experiences of people with feet affected by RA. The nomothetic scale of the SAFE has evidence for face, content and convergent validity (Spearman-Rank co-efficients: 0.62 - 0.80) and excellent one week test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.86 - 1.00 ). The idiographic scale has evidence for face and content validity.The SAFE is a tool for both clinical practice and clinical research. In order to realise the full potential of the SAFE, further research will be undertaken to refine, develop the PROM and integrate it into clinical practice. Initially, it will be necessary to demonstrate additional measurement properties for the nomothetic scale, including clinical interpretability and responsiveness and also necessary to demonstrate quantitative measurement properties for the idiographic scale. Long term, the SAFE will be redeveloped using item response theory and implemented as a computerised adaptive test.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing, Anxiety Levels, and Gender Differences
AN  - 757171388; EJ896744
AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

T1  - A Computerized Adaptive Test for Patients With Shoulder Impairments Produced Responsive Measures of Function
AN  - 860387520; 14539822
AB  - Background Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. Design This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Methods Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. Results On average, patients took about 1.5 minutes (SD <2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal clinically important improvement. Limitations Because this study was a secondary analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future studies would benefit from more complete data. Conclusions The results indicate the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

T1  - Measuring Social Well-Being in People with Chronic Illness
AN  - 754037890; 201052290
AB  - Although social well-being (SWB) is recognized as an integral component of health, it is rarely included in health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments. Two SWB dimensions were identified by literature review: social support (SWB-SS) and social function (SWB-SF). As part of a larger project to develop item response theory-derived item banks and computerized adaptive testing, we developed and tested items for the SWB banks. Item ratings of three large (n>600) datasets were conducted by 15 reviewers. Rasch measurement analyses were conducted to initially define item hierarchies. Out of 83 total items, 8 were removed due to model misfit and 8 were removed because of overlapping item content. We then wrote 11 new SWB-SS and 16 new SWB-SF items to fill content gaps, and edited items to improve comprehension and consistency. A total of 94 items (65 SWB-SS, 29 SWB-SF) was administered by computer to 202 cancer patients. Confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch analyses, and evaluations of construct validity were performed. Patients commented favorably on the content of the items and expressed appreciation for attention to this aspect of their HRQL. Using current psychometric standards for unidimensionality, reliability, and content and construct validity, we derived six preliminary item banks for social support (instrumental support, informational support, positive and negative emotional support, positive and negative social companionship) and two for social function (limitations and satisfaction). The empirical construct hierarchy was consistent with clinical observations; e.g., hobbies and leisure activities tended to reflect more limitations, while meeting the needs of family and friends tended to reflect fewer limitations. Optimal care for patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses includes obtaining a complete picture of patients' physical and psychosocial health status. SWB measures are important since diseases like cancer and their treatment can affect quality of relationships, parental responsibilities, work abilities and social activities. With properly calibrated item banks, it will be possible to precisely and efficiently measure and monitor multiple HRQL dimensions in individual patients, and use their responses to inform care. Qualitative patient feedback and quantitative analyses suggest that it is possible and desirable to include SWB measures in HRQL assessment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An application of computerised adaptive testing for measuring health status in patients with knee osteoarthritis
AN  - 853208757; 201106032
AB  - Purpose. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for measuring health status in knee osteoarthritis. Method. Three hundred and fifty-one patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) answered 118 questions from a range of widely used questionnaires. Three dimensions relevant to knee OA were identified by expert opinion as 'pain, mental and emotional status'; 'self-care and household activities' and 'mobility and social activities'. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the relationship between the items and their dimensions. After CFA, these dimensions were subjected to Rasch analysis to calibrate the items onto an interval scale. A CAT was developed for each dimension, and the results checked against simulated applications from 10,000 simulees. Results. After CFA and Rasch analysis, 14, 22 and 23 items remained in the first, second and third dimensions, respectively. Items were mostly free of differential item functioning for age, gender and duration of disease. Reliability exceeded 0.87 for each dimension. The health status levels generated using item banks and those obtained from the simulated CAT application were highly correlated (i.e. >0.91 for each dimension). On average, 8, 10 and 10 items were used to estimate the health status levels using the CAT for the first, second and third dimensions respectively. Conclusions. Using a combination approach of CFA and Rasch analysis, this study has shown that it is possible to calibrate items onto a single metric in a way that can be used to provide the basis of a CAT application.

T1  - Comparison of Different Equating Methods and An Application to Link Testlet-Based Tests
AN  - 822411041
AB  - Test equating allows direct comparison of test scores from alternative forms measuring the same construct by employing equating procedures to put the test scores on the same metric. Three equating procedures are commonly used in the literature including the concurrent calibration method, the linking separate calibration methods (e.g. the moment methods and the characteristic curve methods), and FPC (Fixed Parameter Calibration) method. The first two types of methods for traditional IRT model have been well developed. FPC is being emphasized recently because of its utility for constructing item bank and computerized adaptive testing (CAT). However, there are few studies that examine the equating accuracy of the FPC method compared to that of the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method.    The equating methods for the traditional IRT model are not appropriate for linking testlet-based tests because the local independence assumption of IRT model cannot be held for this type of tests. Some measurement models, such as testlet response model, bi-factor model, and Rasch testlet model, were advanced to calibrate the models for the testlet-based tests. Few equating methods, however, that take into consideration the additional local dependence among the examinees' responses to items within testlets have been developed for linking testelet-based tests.    To address the need to better understand the FPC method and to develop new equating methods for linking testlet-based tests, the studies were to compare the effectiveness of the three types of equating methods under different linking situations and to develop equating methods for linking testlet-based tests. Besides the equating methods concerned, other factors, including sample size, ability distribution, and characteristics of common items and testlets that might affect equating results were also considered. Three simulation studies were carried out to accomplish the research purposes.    The first study compared the equating accuracies of the FPC, the linking separate calibration, and the concurrent calibration method based on the IRT model to equate item parameters under different conditions. The results indicated that the FPC method using BILOG-MG performed as well as the linking separate calibration method and the concurrent calibration method for linking the equivalent groups. However, the FPC method produced larger equating errors than the other two methods did when the ability distributions of the base and target groups were substantially nonequivalent. Differences in difficulties between the common items set and the total test did not substantially affect the equating results with the three methods, with other conditions being held equal. As expected, both small sample size and less number of common items led to slight greater equating errors.    The second study developed an item characteristic curve method and a testlet characteristic curve method for the testlet response model to transform the scale of item parameters. It then compared the effectiveness of the characteristic curve methods and the concurrent calibration methods under different conditions in linking item parameters from alternate test forms which were composed of dichotomously scored testlet-based items. The newly developed item characteristic curve method and the testlet characteristic curve method were shown to perform similarly as or even better than the Stocking-Lord test characteristic curve method and the concurrent calibration method did. Ignoring the local dependence in model calibration substantially increased equating errors. And larger testlet variances for the common testlets led to greater equating errors.    The last study used the concurrent calibration method under the multidimensional Rasch testlet model to link the testlet-based tests in which the testlets were composed of dichotomous, polytomous, and mixed-format items. The results demonstrated that the concurrent calibration method under the Rasch testlet model worked well in recovering the underlying item parameters. Again, equating errors were substantially increased if the local dependences were ignored in model calibration. And smaller testlet variances for the common testlets led to more accurate equating results.    The results of the studies contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of the different equating methods, particularly those for linking testlet-based tests. They also help clarify influences of the other factors, such as characteristics of the examinees, features of the common items and common testlets on equating results. Testing practitioners and researchers may draw useful recommendations from the findings about equating method selection. Nevertheless, generalizations of the findings from the simulated studies to practical testing programs should be cautious.

T1  - Un algorithme d’échantillonnage permettant d’améliorer la performance prédictive d’un modèle bayésien dans le cadre d’applications de tests adaptatifs
AN  - 750964376
AB  - Bayesian graphical models are commonly used to build student models from data. A number of standard algorithms are available to train Bayesian models from student skills assessment data. These models can assess student knowledge and skills from a few observations. They are useful for Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), for example, where the test items can be administered in order to maximize the information they will provide. In practice, such data often contain missing values and, under some circumstances, missing values far outnumber observed values. However, when collecting data from test results, one can often choose which values will be present or missing by a consequent test design. We study how to optimize the choice of test items for collecting the data that will be used for training a Bayesian CAT model, such as to maximize the predictive performance of the model. We explore the use of a simple heuristic for test item choice based on the level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of an item is derived from its initial probability of success and, thus, from its difficulty.    The results show that this choice does affect model performance and that the heuristic can lead to better performance. Although the study’s results are more exploratory than conclusive, they suggest interesting research avenues.

T1  - Impact of item parameter drift on examinee ability measures in a computer adaptive environment
AN  - 750171758
AB  - This dissertation investigated the impact of item parameter drift (IPD) on examinee ability measures, in the analysis of data generated from a computerized adaptive test (CAT) collected in year 2003 by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in a Medical Technologist (MT) examination. For the 2003 ASCP MT exam, the item bank included 1,270 items. Items were selected from seven subscales: (a) blood banking, (b) chemistry, (c) hematology, (d) immunology, (e) laboratory operations, (f) microbiology, and (g) urinalysis. ASCP administered this CAT to 2,555 examinees.    The data were analyzed using a new hierarchical linear model (HLM), called the Rasch longitudinal model (RLM), which models interaction between the item and time, in addition to parameters of examinee ability and item difficulty (easiness). The analysis demonstrated how IPD within the item bank for the ASCP MT exam affected examinee ability measures, and the extent to which IPD altered certification or pass-fail decisions.    The RLM identified items that exhibited significant IPD for each subscale and provided the magnitude (and direction) of IPD within the 2003 ASCP MT exam data. No one subscale was more sensitive to IPD than any other. Further, by including significant time effects (IPD), the RLM provided a better fit to the data than the Rasch model as an HLM. The RLM not only determined items exhibiting IPD but also compensated for the existence of IPD within the calculation of examinee abilities by using the drifted item difficulty value versus the anchored one. Consequently, the RLM provided more accurate measures of examinee ability and item difficulty than the Rasch model as analyzed using the WINSTEPS program As a result, using the RLM yielded a more efficient IPD detection method, one that identified items with IPD but also corrected the estimation of examinee abilities for the existence of IPD.

T1  - Bilingual health literacy assessment using the Talking Touchscreen/la Pantalla Parlanchina: Development and pilot testing
AN  - 57305435; 200917595
AB  - Objective -- Current health literacy measures are too long, imprecise, or have questionable equivalence of English and Spanish versions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and pilot testing of a new bilingual computer-based health literacy assessment tool. Methods -- We analyzed literacy data from three large studies. Using a working definition of health literacy, we developed new prose, document and quantitative items in English and Spanish. Items were pilot tested on 97 English- and 134 Spanish-speaking participants to assess item difficulty. Results -- Items covered topics relevant to primary care patients and providers. English- and Spanish-speaking participants understood the tasks involved in answering each type of question. The English Talking Touchscreen was easy to use and the English and Spanish items provided good coverage of the difficulty continuum. Conclusion -- Qualitative and quantitative results provided useful information on computer acceptability and initial item difficulty. After the items have been administered on the Talking Touchscreen (la Pantalla Parlanchina) to 600 English-speaking (and 600 Spanish-speaking) primary care patients, we will develop a computer adaptive test. Practice implications -- This health literacy tool will enable clinicians and researchers to more precisely determine the level at which low health literacy adversely affects health and healthcare utilization.

T1  - Using real-data simulations to compare computer adaptive testing and static short-form administrations of an upper extremity item bank
AN  - 304874079
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which administers only items relevant to respondents’ ability, has the advantage of measuring persons’ ability precisely with considerably fewer items than traditional tests. CAT has been proposed for use in healthcare to reduce the respondents’, administrators’ or researchers’ burden in clinics/clinical trials. However, there have been few studies in healthcare that have investigated the optimal characteristics of a CAT. The objective of my study was to investigate: (1) the psychometrics of an item bank measuring upper extremity (UE) disorders for CAT use, (2) how different testing procedures affect the ability estimates from CAT, and (3) whether CAT produce better ability estimates than a traditional static short assessment. The psychometrics of the item bank developed by combining items from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Upper Extremity Functional Index were examined by confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis across body part impairments (neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand). Repeated-measures MANOVA was used to investigate the standard error (SE) and bias of ability estimates from CAT with different testing procedures. Structural equation modeling was implemented to examine the correlations between ability estimates from the full test and different CAT structures and the full test with a short form. Further, paired-sample t test was performed to investigate the SE and bias of ability estimates from CAT and a static short form. In general, the item bank was found essentially unidimensional, the generalized partial credit model fit to the data better than partial credit model and there was no significant DIF. The ability estimates from CAT with expected a posteriori ability estimation method was found to be more precise and more comparable to those from full test than ability estimates derived from the maximum likelihood estimation. Further, CAT had better precision, comparability to full test and sensitivity to detect change than a static short form. The findings from this study suggest that UE CAT differ across estimations methods and are significantly better than a short form version.

T1  - Using computerized adaptive testing to reduce the burden of mental health assessment
AN  - 42437618; 30738
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the combination of item response theory and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for psychiatric measurement as a means of reducing the burden of research and clinical assessments. METHODS: Data were from 800 participants in outpatient treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder; they completed 616 items of the 626-item Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Scales (MASS) at 2 times. The first administration was used to design and evaluate a CAT version of the MASS by using post hoc simulation. The second confirmed the functioning of CAT in live testing. RESULTS: Tests of competing models based on item response theory supported the scale's bifactor structure, consisting of a primary dimension and 4 group factors (mood, panic-agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, and social phobia). Both simulated and live CAT showed a 95% average reduction (585 items) in items administered (24 and 30 items, respectively) compared with administration of the full MASS. The correlation between scores on the full MASS and the CAT version was .93. For the mood disorder subscale, differences in scores between two groups of depressed patients -- one with bipolar disorder and one without -- on the full scale and on the CAT showed effect sizes of .63 (p < .003) and 1.19 (p < .001) standard deviation units, respectively, indicating better discriminant validity for CAT. CONCLUSIONS: Instead of using small fixed-length tests, clinicians can create item banks with a large item pool, and a small set of the items most relevant for a given individual can be administered with no loss of information, yielding a dramatic reduction in administration time and patient and clinician burden.

T1  - Till We Meet Again

AB  - In a series of articles in this issue, Allen proposes and tests a model of movement1; reports the validity and reliability of a self-report instrument, the Movement Ability Measure (MAM)2; and tests the responsiveness to change of the MAM on a small sample of patients.3 The multidimensional model of movement-which includes flexibility, strength, accuracy, speed, adaptability, and endurance-specifies the term "movement" at the human, not cellular or molecular, level for the Movement Continuum Theory.4 As noted in Allen's discussion and in the invited commentaries by Cott and Finch, Martin, and Sullivan, the proposed model of movement has limitations, and the assessment tool has not been tested sufficiently to indicate that it is superior to other instruments such as the Outpatient Physical Therapy Improvement in Movement Assessment Log (OPTIMAL)5 or the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) "item bank" and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) assessment platform (AMPAC-CAT).6 It is clear that we are in the initial rather than final stages of consensus about an instrument that measures outcomes affected by physical therapy intervention and that crosses medical diagnoses, systems, practice settings, acuity, and other variables.

Without formative feedback that connects what a teacher did in the classroom with positive outcomes on the state assessment, a teacher may not feel that he or she can make a difference in how students fare on the state assessment. Teachers who experience low self-efficacy use less effective teaching techniques, and this affects student learning.    Many schools are now using computer adaptive testing, such as the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA-MAP), to provide teachers with formative information to use for instructional improvement. When adjustments to instruction result in higher student achievement, it can provide the teacher with mastery experiences that increase the teacher's efficacy perceptions.    The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teachers' efficacy beliefs for making a difference in their students' performances on the state assessment and teachers' uses of NWEA-MAP test results. Teachers were surveyed using four measures of teacher efficacy and collective teacher efficacy. Two measures that were created for this study demonstrated high reliability with the study sample and correlated well with the two existing scales. Data were also collected on the ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information and the number of different ways they used score information.    The results indicated that the number of ways teachers used NWEA-MAP score information made a significant difference in teachers' scores on the efficacy measures: Using score information in three or four different ways was associated with the highest scores on the efficacy scales. Also, using test score information to set goals with students and to individualize instruction predicted teachers' efficacy scores to a greater degree than did using scores to adjust curriculum and instruction.    The current study, with its two new measures and its suggestions of relationships between variables, provides a starting point for new lines of research in sources of teacher efficacy beliefs.

T1  - Computerized adaptive test item response times for correct and incorrect pretest and operational items: Testing fairness and test -taking strategies
AN  - 304842739
AB  - This study examined the amount of time spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items.    Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels.    A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners’ manual.

T1  - Measurement of Korean EFL college students' foreign language classroom speaking anxiety: Evidence of psychometric properties and accuracy of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) with dichotomously scored items using a CAT simulation
AN  - 85626294; 200614254
AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

T1  - Advanced L2 Learners and Reading Placement: Self-Assessment, CBT, and Subsequent Performance
AN  - 85642362; 200609873
AB  - There is a dearth of research involving advanced second language (L2) learners in the USA [Brantmeier, C., 2001. Second language reading research on passage content & gender: challenges for the intermediate level curriculum, Foreign Language Annals 34, 325-333; Young, D.J., 2003. Workshop on overcoming anxiety in the foreign language classroom. Language Learning Series, Washington University in St. Louis]. At some universities in the USA many freshmen test directly into the advanced levels of Spanish language instruction where the goal is to prepare students for the reading of lengthy, authentic texts. With 71 advanced L2 learners of Spanish, the current research project attempts to determine the reliability of self-assessment, as determined by a questionnaire previously utilized for placement [Birckbichler, D., Corl, K., Deville, C., 1993. The dynamics of language program testing: implications for articulation & program revision. The Dynamics of Language Program Direction. Heinle & Heinle, Boston, MA; Deville, M., Deville, C., 1999. Computer-adaptive testing in second language contexts. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 19, 273-299], to predict reading performance via computer-based testing (CBT) & subsequent reading achievement. All incoming freshmen completed self-assessment questions about L2 reading abilities before completing an online placement exam (OPLE). In order to assess subsequent reading performance, all students who tested into Advanced Spanish Grammar & Composition participated in an investigation during regular class time during the 3rd week of class. Participants read a short story, completed three different comprehension assessment tasks & additional self-assessment items. Overall, results of the present study suggest that self-assessment of L2 reading ability, as measured before & after reading via a 5-point scale, is not an accurate predictor variable for placement or subsequent performance. Advanced learners did not accurately estimate their L2 reading abilities as measured via CBT & in-class performance. Findings do not offer conclusive evidence about the value of self-assessment as a predictor of performance on CBT or as an indicator of subsequent classroom performance, but the current investigation provides indications as to the direction in which research on self-assessment of L2 reading needs to move. A more contextualized, criterion-referenced self-assessment instrument may be more beneficial for the placement of advanced readers in the USA. These results both echo & contradict prior research, which calls attention to the need for more investigations concerning instrumentation of self-assessment as a factor to be used in placement decisions for advanced learners. 2 Tables, 5 Figures, 1 Appendix, 58 References.

T1  - Impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification on ability estimation in computerized adaptive sequential testing (CAST)
AN  - 305322722
AB  - Computer Adaptive Sequential Testing (CAST) is a test delivery model that combines features of the traditional conventional paper-and-pencil testing and item-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The basic structure of CAST is a panel composed of multiple testlets adaptively administered to examinees at different stages. Current applications of CAST reply on the item response theory (IRT) and assume a unidimensional IRT model for scoring.    This study evaluated the robustness of CAST when tests were constructed, administered, and scored by a unidimensional IRT model but item responses were multidimensional. Various conditions of multidimensionality were simulated in item pools, as well as different levels of content misclassification through manipulation of the correspondence between content area and dimension of items. An automated test assembly (ATA) process constructed CAST panels from the item pools, each representing a unique combination of multidimensionality and content misclassification. Administration of the panels was simulated and multidimensional response data were scored by the unidimensional IRT model. The ability scores, routing decisions, and pass-fail decisions were evaluated against "true" ability scores and decisions to assess the impacts of multidimensionality and content misclassification.    Results showed that, when multidimensionality was mild as measured by the angle distance between item clusters, unidimensional ability estimates and routing decisions were not sensitive to the level of content misclassification in item pools. Only when multidimensionality was severe, panels without content misclassification yielded more accurate ability estimates and routing decisions. However, type I errors of pass-fail decisions (defined as passing unqualified examinees) were the smallest for panels without content misclassification, regardless of the severity of multidimensionality. The conclusion was that, although content classification, affecting dimensional structure during test assembly, might not be a serious concern for unidimensional ability estimation and routing decisions for CAST with multidimensional data, it played a significant role in the accuracy of pass-fail decisions.

T1  - Computerized adaptive testing and the experience of flow in examinees
AN  - 305308795
AB  - In recent years, comparisons between computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and paper-and-pencil tests (P&Ps) have focused less on equivalency and more on the construct validity of shifting between the modalities. Examinee motivation is one area of concern, including test and computer anxiety. One type of motivation, flow, has a characteristic pattern of development similar to the pattern of item selection in CAT. Flow theory posits that positive reinforcement is gained through the sensation of achieving optimal performance. This study attempts to determine whether CAT facilitates flow in examinees, enabling them to perform better than on P&Ps. Covariates like test and computer anxiety, academic achievement, and certain personality traits are taken into account. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 94 middle-school CAT examinees to 65 middle-school P&P examinees on their responses to the Flow State Scale 2 (FSS-2), and regression modeling revealed a significant interaction between test modality and test anxiety on state flow, and significant effects for trait flow, typical study time, gender, and ethnicity when controlling for other covariates. Significant effects on specific flow dimensions were also found. The effect of flow on test performance was examined, but may have been limited by sample size. Reliability and dimensionality was confirmed for several instruments, some for the first time with an adolescent population: FSS-2, the Dispositional Flow Scale 2, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Test Anxiety Inventory-Short Form, and the Computer Attitude Scale. Interviews with students were also conducted to confirm the validity of measuring flow in testing situations. Implications of the results are discussed.

T1  - TRENDS IN COMPUTER-BASED SECOND LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT
AN  - 197984864
AB  - In the last 20 years, several authors have described the possible changes that computers may effect in language testing. Since ARAL's last review of general language testing trends (Clapham, 2000), authors in the Cambridge Language Assessment Series have offered various visions of how computer technology could alter the testing of second language skills. This chapter reflects these perspectives as it charts the paths recently taken in the field. Initial steps were made in the conversion of existing item types and constructs already known from paper-and- pencil testing into formats suitable for computer delivery. This conversion was closely followed by the introduction of computer-adaptive tests, which aim to make more, and perhaps, better, use of computer capabilities to tailor tests more closely to individual abilities and interests. Movement toward greater use of computers in assessment has been coupled with an assumption that computer-based tests should be better than their traditional predecessors, and some related steps have been taken. Corpus linguistics has provided tools to create more authentic assessments; the quest for authenticity has also motivated inclusion of more complex tasks and constructs. Both these innovations have begun to be incorporated into computer-based language tests. Natural language processing has also provided some tools for computerized scoring of essays, particularly relevant in large-scale language testing programs. Although computer use has not revolutionized all aspects of language testing, recent efforts have produced some of the research, technological advances, and improved pedagogical understanding needed to support progress.

T1  - On the beat: Human movement and timing in the production and perception of music
AN  - 305378616
AB  - This thesis addresses three aspects of movement, performance and perception in music performance. First, the playing of an accent, a simple but much used and practiced element in drumming is studied, second, the perception of gradually changing tempo, and third, the perception and communication of specific emotional intentions through movements during music performance.    Papers I and II investigated the execution and interpretation of an accent in drumming, performed under different playing conditions. Players' movements, striking velocities and timing patterns were studied for different tempi, dynamic levels and striking surfaces. It was found that the players used differing movement strategies and that interpreted the accent differently, reflected in their movement trajectories. Strokes at higher dynamic levels were played from a greater average height and with higher striking velocities. All players initiated the accented strokes from a greater height, and delivered the accent with increased striking velocity compared to the unaccented strokes. The interval beginning with the accented stroke was also prolonged, generally by delaying the following stroke. Recurrent cyclic patterns were found in the players' timing performances. In a listening test, listeners perceived grouping of the strokes according to the cyclic patterns.    Paper III concerned the perception of gradual tempo changes in auditory sequences. Using an adaptive test procedure subjects judged stimuli consisting of click sequences with either increasing or decreasing tempo, respectively. Each experiment included three test sessions at different nominal tempi (80, 120, and 180 beats per minute). The results showed that ten of the eleven subjects showed an inherent bias in their perception of tempo drift. The direction and magnitude of the bias was consistent between test sessions but varied between individuals. The just noticeable differences for tempo drift agreed well with the estimated tempo drifts in production data, but were much smaller than earlier reported thresholds for tempo drift.    Paper IV studied how emotional intent in music performances is conveyed to observers through the movements of the musicians. Three players of marimba, bassoon, and saxophone respectively, were filmed when playing with the expressive intentions Happiness, Sadness, Anger and Fear. Observers rated the emotional content and movement cues in the videos clips shown without sound. The results showed that the observers were able to identify the intentions Sadness, Anger, and Happiness, but not Fear. The rated movement cues showed that an Angry performance was characterized by jerky movements, Happy performances by large, and somewhat fast and jerky movements, and Sad performances by slow, and smooth movements.

T1  - Constructing Rotating Item Pools for Constrained Adaptive Testing
AN  - 57303096; 200917761
AB  - Preventing items in adaptive testing from being over- or underexposed is one of the main problems in computerized adaptive testing. Though the problem of overexposed items can be solved using a probabilistic item-exposure control method, such methods are unable to deal with the problem of underexposed items. Using a system of rotating item pools, on the other hand, is a method that potentially solves both problems. In this method, a master pool is divided into (possibly overlapping) smaller item pools, which are required to have similar distributions of content and statistical attributes. These pools are rotated among the testing sites to realize desirable exposure rates for the items. A test assembly model, motivated by Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, was explored to help solve the problem of dividing a master pool into a set of smaller pools. Different methods to solve the model are proposed. An item pool from the Law School Admission Test was used to evaluate the performances of computerized adaptive tests from systems of rotating item pools constructed using these methods.

T1  - A calibration of the McGill Pain Questionnaire -Short Form: Using item response theory
AN  - 305195281
AB  - The McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ - SF) is a measure of pain published in 1987. This dissertation conducts a confirmatory factor analysis of the measure's structure, as well as a calibration of the items on the measure, using Item Response Theory. A total of 1185 patients reporting to two chronic pain care treatment centers completed the MPQ - SF in the course of their admission to treatment. Factor analyses of their data suggests a three-factor solution of “acute,” “emotional,” and “soreness” factors led to a higher order factor of “pain.” This solution provides an adequate fit for the data. Previously published one and two factor structures did not demonstrate adequate fit in this data set. Unidimensionality in this sample was supported by the presence of a higher order factor of “Pain.” Items on the measure are calibrated using the two-parameter logistic model. Specifically, item slope and location parameters are calculated for each of the items, and differential item functioning is investigated between four subgroups of data. Performance on the items was contrasted between subgroups differing on gender, pain diagnosis, workers' compensation status and pain coping status using Raju's DFIT methodology. No differential test functioning was found; however, some individual items did display differential item functioning by subgroup. Sample characteristics that contribute to differential item functioning are examined further. Additionally, implications for diagnostic considerations and computer adaptive testing are discussed.

T1  - Evaluating the effects of several multi -stage testing design variables on selected psychometric outcomes for certification and licensure assessment
AN  - 305176302
AB  - Computer-based testing is becoming popular with credentialing agencies because new test designs are possible and the evidence is clear that these new designs can increase the reliability and validity of candidate scores and pass/fail decisions. Research on MST to date suggests that the measurement quality of MST results is comparable to full-fledged computer-adaptive tests and improved over computerized fixed-form tests. MST's promise dwells in this potential for improved measurement with greater control than other adaptive approaches for constructing test forms.    Recommending use of the MST design and advising how best to set up the design, however, are two different things. The purpose of the current simulation study was to advance an established line of research on MST methodology by enhancing understanding of how several important design variables affect outcomes for high-stakes credentialing.   Modeling of the item bank, the candidate population, and the statistical characteristics of test items reflect an operational credentialing exam's conditions. Studied variables were module arrangement (4 designs), amount of overall test information (4 levels), distribution of information over stages (2 variations), strategies for between-stage routing (4 levels), and pass rates (3 levels), for 384 conditions total.   Results showed that high levels of decision accuracy (DA) and decision consistency (DC) were consistently observed, even when test information was reduced by as much as 25%. No differences due to the choice of module arrangement were found. With high overall test information, results were optimal when test information was divided equally among stages; with reduced test information gathering more test information at Stage 1 provided the best results.    Generalizing simulation study findings is always problematic. In practice, psychometric models never completely explain candidate performance, and with MST, there is always the potential psychological impact on candidates if test difficulty shifts are noticed. At the same time, two findings seem to stand out in this research: (1) with limited amounts of overall test information, it may be best to capitalize on available information with accurate branching decisions early, and (2) there may be little statistical advantage in exceeding test information much above 10 as gains in reliability and validity appear minimal.

T1  - Influence of Voice Similarity on Talker Discrimination in Normal-Hearing Children and Hearing-Impaired Children with Cochlear Implants
AN  - 85574885; 200310417
AB  - In this study, we investigated how manipulations of voice similarity affect talker discrimination judgments in children. More specifically, we addressed the question of how different must two sentences be in terms of their average fundamental & formant frequencies for children to categorize these utterances as spoken by different talkers? Same-different judgments were obtained using an adaptive testing procedure in which the similarity of voice pairs was systematically varied. Participants included 5-year-old normal-hearing children & cochlear implant (CI) users ages 5-12 years, implanted at or before age 6 years with 2+ years of implant experience. Stimuli consisted of natural sentence-length utterances resynthesized to form a stimulus continuum of similar-sounding voices. The probability of "different talker" judgments was examined for each listener group as a function of pitch difference size. We compared this measure of "acceptable within-talker variability" under two different presentation conditions, one in which the linguistic content of the sentence was held constant & one in which the linguistic content was varied. We found that the spectral envelopes of two utterances, together with their average fundamental frequencies, needed to differ by at least 11-16% for normal-hearing children to perceive the voices as belonging to different talkers. Normal-hearing children maintained the perception of voice individuality over a larger frequency shift than previously studied normal-hearing adults. Although several individual children with implants exhibited response patterns that resembled those of normal-hearing children, most of the hearing-impaired children experienced difficulty perceiving even large differences between talkers. Both groups of children displayed essentially the same pattern of responses in both the "fixed sentence" & "varied sentence" conditions, indicating no effect of linguistic variability on the children's criteria for identifying two talkers as the same or different. Greater variability in performance was observed, however, in the varied sentence condition for both listener groups. Finally, within the CI group, higher spoken word recognition scores were found to be associated with better talker discrimination performance. Our results suggest that poor discrimination of pitch & timbre-based differences is a factor contributing to implanted children's difficulty with talker discrimination tasks; implications of this finding are discussed in detail. 4 Tables, 12 Figures, 4 Appendixes, 110 References.

T1  - Statistical detection and estimation of differential item functioning in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 305338294
AB  - Differential item functioning (DIF) is an important issue in large scale standardized testing. DIF refers to the unexpected difference in item performances among groups of equally proficient examinees, usually classified by ethnicity or gender. Its presence could seriously affect the validity of inferences drawn from a test. Various statistical methods have been proposed to detect and estimate DIF.    This dissertation addresses DIF analysis in the context of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), whose item selection algorithm adapts to the ability level of each individual examinee. In a CAT, a DIF item may be more consequential and more detrimental be cause fewer items are administered in a CAT than in a traditional paper-and-pencil test and because the remaining sequence of items presented to examinees depends in part on their responses to the DIF item. Consequently, an efficient, stable and flexible method to detect and estimate CAT DIF becomes necessary and increasingly important.    We propose simultaneous implementations of online calibration and DIF testing. The idea is to perform online calibration of an item of interest separately in the focal and reference groups. Under any specific parametric IRT model, we can use the (online) estimated latent traits as covariates and fit a nonlinear regression model to each of the two groups. Because of the use of the estimated, not the true &thetas;, the regression fit has to adjust for the covariate “measurement errors”. It turns out that this situation fits nicely into the framework of nonlinear error-in-variable modelling, which has been extensively studied in statistical literature.    We develop two bias-correction methods using asymptotic expansion and conditional score theory. After correcting the bias caused by measurement error, one can perform a significance test to detect DIF with the parameter estimates for different groups. This dissertation also discusses some general techniques to handle measurement error modelling with different IRT models, including the three-parameter normal ogive model and polytomous response models. Several methods of estimating DIF are studied as well.    Large sample properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies show that the resulting methods perform well in terms of Type-I error rate control, accuracy in estimating DIF and power against both unidirectional and crossing DIF.

T1  - The implications of the use of non -optimal items in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment
AN  - 276279115
AB  - This study describes the effects of manipulating item difficulty in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) environment. There are many potential benefits when using CATS as compared to traditional tests. These include increased security, shorter tests, and more precise measurement. According to IRT, the theory underlying CAT, as the computer continually recalculates ability, items that match that current estimate of ability are administered. Such items provide maximum information about examinees during the test. Herein, however, lies a potential problem. These optimal CAT items result in an examinee having only a 50% chance of a correct response. Some examinees may consider such items unduly challenging. Further, when test anxiety is a factor, it is possible that test scores may be negatively affected.    This research was undertaken to determine the effects of administering easier CAT items on ability estimation and test length using computer simulations. Also considered was the administration of different numbers of initial items prior to the start of the adaptive portion of the test, using three different levels of measurement precision.    Results indicate that regardless of the number of initial items administered, the level of precision employed, or the modifications made to item difficulty, the approximation of estimated ability to true ability is good in all cases. Additionally, the standard deviations of the ability estimates closely approximate the theoretical levels of precision used as stopping rules for the simulated CATs.    Since optimal CAT items are not used, each item administered provides less information about examinees than optimal CAT items. This results in longer tests. Fortunately, using easier items that provide up to a 66.4% chance of a correct response results in tests that only modestly increase in length, across levels of precision. For larger standard errors, even easier items (up to a 73.5% chance of a correct response) result in only negligible to modest increases in test length.    Examinees who find optimal CAT items difficult or examinees with test anxiety may find CATs that implement easier items enhance the already existing benefits of CAT.

T1  - Differences Between Self-Adapted and Computerized Adaptive Tests: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 57298712; 200920118
AB  - Self-adapted testing has been described as a variation of computerized adaptive testing that reduces test anxiety and thereby enhances test performance. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of these proposed effects of self-adapted tests (SATs); meta-analysis procedures were used to estimate differences between SATs and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in proficiency estimates and post-test anxiety levels across studies in which these two types of tests have been compared. After controlling for measurement error, the results showed that SATs yielded proficiency estimates that were 0.12 standard deviation units higher and post-test anxiety levels that were 0.19 standard deviation units lower than those yielded by CATs. We speculate about possible reasons for these differences and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using SATs in operational settings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Effects of Changes in the Examinees' Ability Distribution on the Exposure Control Methods in CAT
AN  - 62355853; ED453228
AB  - To satisfy the security requirements of computerized adaptive tests (CATs), efforts have been made to control the exposure rates of optimal items directly by incorporating statistical methods into the item selection procedure. Since differences are likely to occur between the exposure control parameter derivation stage and the operational CAT administrations, the exposure control methods may not fully accomplish the goal of controlling item exposure. This study explored the effects of the distribution changes on the performance of the Sympson and Hetter (SH) (J. Sympson and R. Hetter, 1985) and the Davey and Parshall (DP) (T. Davey and C. Parshall, 1995) procedures and provided an examination of the assertion that the Stocking and Lewis (M. Stocking and C. Lewis, 1998) conditional multinomial (SLC) procedure would function independently of an real examinee population. Simulations were carried out for this study using various combinations of the intended and real ability distributions. The results show that the changes in the examinees' ability distribution affected both SH and DP procedures in their control of the observed maximum exposure rates, and the effects were more profound for the SH method. The performance of the SLC method was demonstrated to be independent of the examinee's ability distributions in the operational CAT administrations. Contains 19 references, 5 tables, and 4 figures.

T1  - Computerized -adaptive versus paper -and -pencil testing environments: An experimental analysis of examinee experience
AN  - 250988108
AB  - Computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) is quickly becoming the test mode of choice among many high-stakes testing agencies. Although some researchers suggest that CAT is comparable, if not better, than traditional paper-and-pencil testing, others have suggested that individual differences among examinees have not been fully explored. In particular, the additional cognitive demands imposed by CAT are not well understood. For example, in the CAT mode there is the added demand of moving back and forth from computer screen to scrap paper when one has to solve more complex problems. In traditional paper and-pencil (P&P) testing environments, there is but one mode with which to contend: paper-and-pencil. In addition, CAT may generate greater anxiety—which further increases cognitive load—among some test-takers than would be found with more traditional testing modes. For example, with CAT you cannot go back to review previous items or change previous answers. And CAT requires something that is anxiety provoking in and of itself for some individuals: use of a computer.    The purpose of this study was to explore the effects, particularly the cognitive effects, of different testing environments on individual test-taker experience. Forty undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions: CAT mode or P&P testing mode. All subjects took the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination. Methodology for the study included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil instruments, videotaped recording of subject behavior, observation, and interview. Verbal protocol analysis of subsamples of subjects' work-toward-solution behavior on two analytical reasoning problems was also included.    Results of multivariate and univariate analyses suggest significant differences across test mode, with respect to cognitive demands. Compared to subjects in the paper-and-pencil test mode, CAT subjects had significantly longer response times on analytical reasoning (AR) problems, relied more on scrap paper to model AR problems diagrammatically, and employed different problem-solving strategies. Differences in affective responses—including anxiety and frustration—further suggest test mode effects were present. CAT subjects expressed significantly more frustration with the test mode than did their P&P counterparts. Furthermore, CAT subjects with low computer confidence experienced significantly higher levels of test anxiety than did their more computer-confident peers. Implications for test developers and recommendations for further research are offered.

T1  - A ‘rearrangement procedure’ for administering adaptive tests when review options are permitted
AN  - 250951635
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained increased popularity during the last decades. Consequently, admissions tests such as the GRE, the TOEFL, as well as other certification and licensure exams have been transformed from their paper-and-pencil versions to computerized adaptive versions. However, a major difference between the two test formats, from an examinee's point of view, is that examinees are usually not allowed to revise their answers on CATs. Some researchers feel that the validity of a CAT can increase with item review, since it allows them to rethink their answers and make corrections to items that have been misread or miskeyed. Other researchers believe that item review can decrease the efficiency and validity of a CAT since item review allows examinees to cheat on the test.    The purpose of this study was to test the efficiency of a ‘ rearrangement procedure’ that rearranges and skips certain items in order to better estimate the examinees' abilities. This was examined through a simulation study. This rearrangement procedure permits examinees to change their answers on a CAT without allowing them to artificially inflate their test scores. If this procedure were adopted, it could help reduce the stress of examinees who feel that they have more control over the testing situation when they can revise their answers. This procedure could also help improve the reliability and validity of the CAT since errors due to misread and miskeyed answers would be corrected.    The results of this simulation study have shown that when the Maximum Likelihood estimation was used, the rearrangement procedure was effective in reducing the bias of the ability estimates. With the Bayesian estimation, the rearrangement procedure increased the reliability, and slightly decreased the standard error of the estimates. However, the Bayesian method was not effective in reducing the bias of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure.    There were not many differences in the accuracy of the estimates after the rearrangement procedure, when three or five items were reviewed. There were also very small differences in the effects that the item pool size had on the accuracy of the ability estimates after the rearrangement procedure.

T1  - Applicant reactions to novel selection tools
AN  - 304615853
AB  - Organizations are increasingly using novel tools (e.g., multimedia, web-based, computer adaptive testing) in designing selection systems. While there is great interest in using these tools, there is little research to indicate how applicants react to them. As applicant reactions have been shown to affect a number of variables important to organizations (e.g., test fairness, job acceptance, productivity, recommendation intentions), it is important to understand what determines these reactions. A framework was developed to highlight a number of antecedents to, types of, and consequences of reactions to novel testing. The current study has a 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and-pencil - computerized) x 2 (perceived technical level of the job: high technical job - low technical job) x 2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design. While test-takers' post-test perceptions do not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, factors such as computer anxiety and experience were shown to be important factors in determining success in the selection process. Results show the significant relationships between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing novel selection tools in an applicant setting.

T1  - Impact of Local Item Dependence on Item Response Theory Scoring in CAT. Law School Admission Council Computerized Testing Report. LSAC Research Report Series
AN  - 62188696; ED467817
AB  - This study represented a first attempt to evaluate the impact of local item dependence (LID) for Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The most basic CAT design and a simplified design for simulating CAT item pools with varying degrees of LID were applied. A data generation method that allows the LID among items to be defined was applied to generate five CAT item pools. The LID exhibited by these pools ranged from zero LID (complete local item independence) to extreme LID. Results indicate that for certain types of scoring an extreme amount of LID may adversely impact the final score obtained by the examinee. The estimated precision of the test was also affected by the extreme LID level studied here. For the medium level of LID, structured to display the amount of LID typically displayed by the Law School Admission Test, the effects of the LID were not troublesome.

T1  - The development of a computerized version of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the effect of visuo -spatial working memory loading
AN  - 304522650
AB  - This dissertation focused on the generation and evaluation of web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Memory and spatial visualization theory were explored in relation to the addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component.    Analysis of the data determined that there was a significant difference between scores on the MRT Computer and MRT Memory test. The addition of a visuo-spatial working memory component did significantly affect results at the .05 alpha level. Reliability and discrimination estimates were higher on the MRT Memory version. The computerization of the paper and pencil version on the MRT did not significantly effect scores but did effect the time required to complete the test.    The population utilized in the quasi-experiment consisted of 107 university students from eight institutions in engineering graphics related courses. The subjects completed two researcher developed, Web-based versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test and the original paper and pencil version of the Mental Rotation Test. One version of the test included a visuo-spatial working memory loading.    Significant contributions of this study included developing and evaluating computerized versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test. Previous versions of Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test did not take advantage of the ability of the computer to incorporate an interaction factor, such as a visuo-spatial working memory loading, into the test. The addition of an interaction factor results in a more discriminate test which will lend itself well to computerized adaptive testing practices.    Educators in engineering graphics related disciplines should strongly consider the use of spatial visualization tests to aid in establishing the effects of modern computer systems on fundamental design/drafting skills. Regular testing of spatial visualization skills will result assist in the creation of a more relevant curriculum. Computerized tests which are valid and reliable will assist in making this task feasible.

T1  - Simulating Nonmodel-Fitting Responses in a CAT Environment. ACT Research Report Series 98-10
AN  - 62483487; ED427042
AB  - This study developed a model to simulate nonmodel-fitting responses in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) environment, and to examine the effectiveness of the model. The underlying idea was to simulate examinees' test behaviors realistically. This study simulated a situation in which examinees are exposed to or are coached on test items before actual testing. The multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) (M. Reckase, 1985) model was adopted for this study. Test characteristic curves and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were investigated. The results indicate that the probability of an examinee responding to an item correctly and the proportion of affected items administered to examinees were influenced by the severity and the number of affected items. The results also suggest that the proposed model might be an effective tool for investigating the issue of nonmodel-fitting responses in a CAT environment. (Contains 7 figures and 39 references.)

T1  - The Influence of a Semester Abroad on Reading Proficiency: A Descriptive Study
AN  - 85664874; 9902442
AB  - The effects on second language reading comprehension of studying in the target-language country were investigated. Beginning- through advanced-level subjects ([Ss] N = 21, aged 20-34) at the Center for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language at Beijing U came from North America & Europe. The main test instrument, the Computer Adaptive Test for Reading Chinese, is a HyperCard (Macintosh) computer program; its advantages are detailed. Additional data were obtained through interviews. Results show that 14 Ss improved comprehension from pre- to post-test, 5 remained at the same level, & 2 declined. The numerous factors potentially affecting outcomes include starting proficiency, nature of classroom instruction & materials, number of Ss, study & reading habits, motivation, & timing of assessments. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 10 References.

AB  - A survey of some of the issues in assessing second-language listening ability discusses & evaluates some of the methods & techniques used, & potential applications. Noting the inadequacy of current models, the common themes of skills hierarchies & listening as an interactive process dominate current research approaches. Major research issues are identified as (1) assessing higher level listening skills, (2) confounding of skills, (3) assessing listening in oral interaction, & (4) dealing with authenticity. Assessment tasks are constructed with focus on the factors affecting test performance & the practical issues of test construction. The potential of computer-adaptive assessment, computer-based dictation, & computer-adaptive tests with interactive capabilities are noted, as well as the use of video, underlining the importance of visual support for listening.

T1  - A study of two computerized adaptive tests within an item response theory framework
AN  - 304433174
AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an item response theory (IRT). Additionally this study examined the effect of repeated practice with ACCUPLACER on subsequent ACCUPLACER and COMPASS scores. General opinions of students toward ACCUPLACER and COMPASS and correlations between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and paper-and-pencil (P&P) formats were investigated.    Methods. The investigator sampled 517 ACCUPLACER tests in order to develop a large number of response patterns and scores. This data source was used to investigate five claims of ACCUPLACER developers and consistency between item response patterns and test scores in ACCUPLACER. This study employed seven classes of developmental mathematics; specifically, three classes were the experimental group and four classes comprised the control group. As treatment, students from the experimental group practiced the ACCUPLACER four times during the quarter. Students from all seven classes took the preACCUPLACER, postACCUPLACER, preCOMPANION, postCOMPANION, postCOMPASS, and Developmental Final Examinations. All students responded to the Opinionnaires of the ACCUPLACER and COMPASS. Scores on SAT-Math, SAT-Verbal, and Collegiate Placement Examination were obtained from students' records.    Results. Test questions generated from all correct responses and test questions generated from all incorrect responses were disjoint. Starter questions were found to be moderately easy rather than average difficulty. Six of the twelve items were identical and appeared in the same position on many initially correct response patterns. Lower scores came from initially incorrect response patterns. Scores varied greatly within the same response pattern when different sequences of items were given. A total of 108 different items were found, not the expected 214 items. Several starter questions appeared as later items in tests with primarily incorrect responses. Some correlations between CAT and P&P formats were significant $(p < .05).$ Students found that instructions and graphics were unclear on CATs.    Conclusions. The results of this study are not consistent with five of the purported claims of ACCUPLACER developers within an IRT framework. Several sets of scores within the same response pattern widely varied. Repeated practice on a CAT did not affect subsequent CAT scores. Correlations between CAT and P&P formats indicate that one format of testing is not a good predictor of the other form of testing. Remedial students find CATs difficult to understand.

T1  - A comparative study of item exposure control methods in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 304414840
AB  - This study investigated and compared the properties of five methods of item exposure control within the purview of estimating examinees' abilities in a CAT context. Simulations were used to carry out this research. The item pools were constructed based on item parameters calibrated from the existing paper-and-pencil ACT Assessment Mathematics Test. Each of the exposure control algorithms was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed according to the CAT design established for this study. The merits and shortcomings of these strategies were considered under two item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of item security, test overlap rates, pool utilization, and the conditional standard errors of measurement, bias, and root mean squared errors.    The general observations revealed that the randomization technique did not better ensure item security to any noticeable extent than the procedure without exposure control. The Sympson and Hetter and the Stocking and Lewis unconditional multinomial procedures produced very similar results under all conditions. However, when developing the exposure control parameters, the Sympson and Hetter method was much more efficient. The results yielded by the Davey and Parshall procedure were in general favorable. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates, but this came at the price of decreases in precision due to the strict control of item exposure.    The performance of the various methods was affected differentially by the size of the item pool. Also, the comparative properties of the various methods were not consistent under the two desired exposure rate conditions. These differential effects might be attributed to the specific features of the algorithms in combination with the structure of the item pool.    Each method had its advantages and disadvantages, but none possessed all desired characteristics. There was a clear and logical trade-off between exposure control and measurement precision. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure, and to a slightly lesser extent, the Davey and Parshall method seemed to be the most promising considering all factors this study addressed.

T1  - Overview of Practical Issues in a CAT Program
AN  - 62624506; ED408330
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

T1  - Examinee Issues in CAT
AN  - 62603310; ED408329
AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

T1  - An investigation of selected variables to predict student performance on the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) in one baccalaureate degree nursing program
AN  - 304377477
AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well academic, demographic, and programmatic variables could explain and predict variation in graduate performance on NCLEX-RN in one baccalaureate nursing program. The study specifically sought to address the void in empirical research in the area of programmatic variables predictive of NCLEX-RN performance. The study also investigated whether the changes made in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to computer adaptive testing (CAT), which was initiated in 1994, could help explain variations experience in program pass rate between 1990 and 1996.    The population was composed of 360 May and June graduates from one baccalaureate nursing program. The research method used in this study was an archival survey.    Analysis of t-tests and z-tests showed that the two outcome groups (pass group and fail group) differed significantly (p $<$.05) in terms of gender and ethnicity. Moreover, the two groups differed significantly in terms of many academic variables (ACT Composite score; admission, freshman, sophomore, junior, cumulative, nursing and science GPA's; and number of nursing and support courses repeated). In the final logistic regression model, four of the independent variables; gender (SEX), nursing GPA, number of nursing and support courses repeated (REPEAT), and the mean educational level of the clinical nursing faculty (C-ED), were found to be significant predictors of NCLEX-RN performance (p $<$.05; one-tailed probability). The author concluded that male and minority students, and student who have repeated nursing and support courses, are at risk for failure on NCLEX-RN. Additionally, because the education of the clinical faculty proved to affect graduate odds for success on NCLEX-RN, it was recommended that programs strive to attract, recruit, and retain highly qualified clinical faculty.    When added to the regression equation, the version of the NCLEX-RN did not prove to be statistically significant. The researcher concluded, therefore, that the change in NCLEX-RN from a paper-and-pencil test to CAT did not contribute to the variations in the NCLEX-RN pass rate experienced by this nursing program.

T1  - Accuracy of parameter estimation on polytomous IRT models
AN  - 304356874
AB  - Procedures based on item response theory (IRT) are widely accepted for solving various measurement problems which cannot be solved using classical test theory (CTT) procedures. The desirable features of dichotomous IRT models over CTT are well known and have been documented by Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991). However, dichotomous IRT models are inappropriate for situations where items need to be scored in more than two categories. For example, in performance assessments, most of the scoring rubrics for performance assessment require scoring of examinee's responses in ordered categories. In addition, polytomous IRT models are useful for assessing an examinee's partial knowledge or levels of mastery. However, the successful application of polytomous IRT models to practical situations depends on the availability of reasonable and well-behaved estimates of the parameters of the models. Therefore, in this study, the behavior of estimators of parameters in polytomous IRT models were examined.    In the first study, factors that affected the accuracy, variance, and bias of the marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimators in the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) were investigated. Overall, the results of the study showed that the MML estimators of the parameters of the GPCM, as obtained through the computer program, PARSCALE, performed well under various conditions. However, there was considerable bias in the estimates of the category parameters under all conditions investigated. The average bias did not decrease when sample size and test length increased. The bias contributed to large RMSE in the estimation of category parameters. Further studies need to be conducted to study the effect of bias in the estimates of parameters on the estimation of ability, the development of item banks, and on adaptive testing based on polytomous IRT models.    In the second study, the effectiveness of Bayesian procedures for estimating parameters in the GPCM was examined. The results showed that Bayes procedures provided more accurate estimates of parameters with small data sets. Priors on the slope parameters, while having only a modest effect on the accuracy of estimation of slope parameters, had a very positive effect on the accuracy of estimation of the step difficulty parameters.

T1  - A Critical Analysis of the Arguments for and against Item Review in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62583642; ED400267
AB  - In recent years, a controversy has arisen about the advisability of allowing examinees to review their test items and possibly change answers. Arguments for and against allowing item review are discussed, and issues that a test designer should consider when designing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) are identified. Most CATs do not allow examinees the opportunity to review their items. The reasons advanced for this position include: (1) the possibility of item dependence that might affect another answer; (2) a decrease in testing efficiency; (3) opening the test results to effects of test-taking strategies; (4) an increase in testing time; and (5) complications in test development. Arguments in favor of allowing review focus on legitimate score gain possibilities. The first usually advanced is that examinees prefer to be able to review, and the second is that review yields legitimately improved scores. Consideration of arguments for and against item review is complicated by the presence of multiple stakeholders in the measurement process. The question of allowing item review is one without a clear answer, but the interests of test takers and test givers should be protected, perhaps by the development of new types of CAT.

T1  - The effects of person misfit in computerized adaptive testing
AN  - 304265537
AB  - In the past several years many statistical indices have been developed that attempt to quantify the extent to which responses to questions on a test fit the underlying test model. This area of research is commonly referred to as person fit.    Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a test administration procedure in which questions are selected from a pool of available questions depending on how an examinee has responded to previous test questions. Thus, within the CAT environment each examinee is administered a tailored or dynamic test that is unique compared to other examinees' tests.    Previous researchers have not investigated the issue of person fit within the context of CAT. The present study was a monte carlo investigation that simulated nonmodel-fitting responses within the CAT environment under a variety of conditions. The independent variables in this investigation were (1) the number of nonmodel-fitting responses, (2) the location of the nonmodel-fitting responses, (3) the point in the CAT process at which testing terminated, and (4) the entry point used for the CAT. The dependent variables were (1) the number of questions administered, (2) accuracy of the estimates of examinees' location on the latent trait ability continuum ($\theta$), (3) each examinee's fit to the underlying model using the $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices, and (4) the distribution of $l\sb{z}$ and ECI4$\sb{z}$ indices within the CAT environment.    It was found that when several nonmodel-fitting responses occurred early in the CAT procedure (i.e., warm-up effect) the recovery of $\theta$ was very poor. When a warm-up effect was simulated, not only did test length increase but also more examinees were identified as not fitting the model. Using a standard error of less than.20 to terminate the CAT resulted in estimated $\theta$ values that were biased and poorly estimated. Finally, the entry point used in the CAT administration did not seem to affect final ability estimates.    Future research should consider developing new indices to quantify the extent to which examinees fit the test model within the CAT environment, and new methods of simulated nonmodel-fitting response patterns within CAT.

T1  - The Estimation of Item Difficulty from Restricted CAT Calibration Samples
AN  - 62632850; ED386466
AB  - Whether the presence of bidimensionality has any effect on the adaptive recalibration of test items was studied through live-data simulation of computer adaptive testing (CAT) forms. The source data were examinee responses to the 298 scored multiple choice items of a licensure examination in a health care profession. Three 75-item part-forms, differing in the degree of bidimensionality, were constructed from the examination forms. The dimensionality of each item was determined based on principal factor loadings using W. F. Stout's (1987) procedure. Samples of 2,100 examinees from an U.S.-educated group and a predominantly foreign-educated group were used, with samples sizes of 100, 200, 400, and 1,000 used for the analyses. As expected, an increase in sample size resulted in greater agreement between calibration and bank b-values. It appeared that dimensionality affected adaptive recalibration. Results from this study varied depending on the dimensionality of the part-forms. Results also affirm the importance of a well-defined reference group for recalibration, since samples from varying ability ranges sometimes produced considerably different b-values. Three tables present details of the analyses. (Contains six references.) (SLD)

T1  - Practical Design and Implementation Considerations of a Computer Adaptive Foreign Language Test: The Monash/Melbourne French CAT
AN  - 750312360
AB  - While the psychometric and statistical models underlying the design of computer adaptive tests (CAT) are well understood, relatively few working models exist for the purpose of foreign language assessment. Likewise, little has been published concerning the practical considerations affecting the implementation of such tests. in the process of constructing the Monash/Melbourne French CAT, we discovered much about putting testing theory into practice. The present paper reports this experience in three parts. In a preliminary section, we describe the academic context in which the French CAT was created and trialed. This is followed by a detailed consideration of the test presentation platform and operating algorithms. Lastly, we give an evaluation of the first administration of the French CAT, accompanied by a discussion of the test's reliability and validity as a placement instrument for first year Australian university students.

T1  - The Relationships between Individual Difference Variables and Test Performance in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62742305; ED382623
AB  - The relationship between several individual difference variables and test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was studied with 208 South Korean college students. The general individual difference variable selected was test anxiety, and the math-related individual difference variables were mathematics aptitude, math test anxiety, and math self-concept. Computer-related individual difference variables were computer literacy, computer anxiety, and computer experience. The CAT was an algebra test. Test anxiety and other individual difference variables were measured with instruments translated into Korean for the study. The seven difference variables and their squares were submitted to an analysis using the RSQUARE Procedure from Statistical Analysis System software. Math aptitude, math self-concept, math test anxiety, and computer literacy, in that order, were significantly related to test performance using CAT, but test anxiety, computer experience, and computer anxiety were not. Results suggest that the relationship between individual difference variables and test performance using CAT may be curvilinear. Two tables present analysis results. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing Exploring Examinee Response Time Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling
AN  - 62566300; ED400287
AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

T1  - Technological Applications in Science Assessment
AN  - 62779434; ED361207
AB  - Educational technology has been a focus of development and research in science teaching and learning. This document reviews research dealing with computer and hypermedia applications to assessment in science education. The paper reports the findings first for computer applications for assessment and then for hypermedia applications in assessment. Computer applications include access to large test banks, evaluation of student data collected in laboratory exercises, microcomputer-administered diagnostic testing, effects of computer use on student motivation during computer-administered tests, and computerized adaptive testing. Hypermedia applications include interactive videodisc technology for teaching biology, assessing teachers' knowledge for certification purposes, problem-based learning in chemistry found in the "Hyperequation" project, and administering figural response test items to cell and molecular biology students. The summary describes three advantages for incorporating computer-assisted assessment: immediate student feedback, ease of test taking, and availability of another form of formative assessment. Users of computer-assisted assessment are cautioned that computer-generated tests can lull the teacher into simply testing low level recall knowledge, and that the linear nature of computer testing does not allow the student to go back and reflect upon particular items.

T1  - How Review Options and Administration Modes Influence Scores on Computerized Vocabulary Tests
AN  - 62917480; ED346161
AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

T1  - Computer-adaptive versus pencil and paper tests
AN  - 304053062
AB  - This dissertation examined the feasibility of using computer adaptive technology to administer certification examinations. The agenda for this research was (1) to compare a computer adaptive test (CAT) with paper and pencil (PAP) tests in terms of the comparability of item calibrations and the comparability of examinee ability estimates and (2) to examine the CAT under varying test conditions to determine whether modifications in traditional test design affect examinee performance.    Results show that PAP item calibrations were functionally equivalent to the CAT item calibrations even though items on the CAT were administered to varying numbers of examinees and appeared in different contexts for different examinees. Examinees performed comparably on the CAT and the PAP as evidenced by a.83 correlation, adjusted for measurement error, and a mean difference of.01 across the two modes of administration. There were no significant differences between the CAT and the PAP ability estimates due to sex, ethnic origin, age or whether or not English was the examinee's first language.    On the CAT, examinees were randomly placed in test design conditions in which the effects of altering the difficulty of the start, the difficulty of the test, the minimum test length and the option to skip, defer or review items were examined. There were no significant differences in examinee performance across these groups indicating that some of these design options may be viable for CAT.    Test length was reduced on the CAT without sacrificing confidence in the pass/fail decision. Test length on the PAP was 109 items; mean test length on the CAT was 66 items when the maximum test length was set at 100 items and 86 items when the maximum test length was set at 240 items.    Results from this study indicate that CAT can be an excellent way to administer certification exams. Examinees can benefit by being able to take shorter exams, scheduled at their convenience and receive immediate test results. For the certification board, CAT can improve data collection and test security, and provide greater confidence in pass/fail decisions.

T1  - The effect of adaptive testing item selection methods on the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation
AN  - 304000167
AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty.    The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data.    Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

T1  - Linguistic predictors of SAT antonym item difficulty: Identification and employment
AN  - 303987555
AB  - This research investigates the extent to which linguistic features of standardized test antonym items can be used to predict the empirical difficulty of these items. The study was motivated by both theoretical and practical considerations. Theoretically, exploring content-feature correlates of difficulty is a form of construct validation as such inquiry attends to the question of why an item is easy or difficult. The pursuit of evidential links between content and difficulty is a scientific, falsifiable approach to validation. In contrast, conventional response-based analyses do not address the central role played by item content in controlling difficulty. From a practical standpoint, detecting content-based predictors allows for the scaling of similarly constructed items without having to establish difficulty measurements via pretesting.    Twelve variables associated with stem and keyed answer words of 975 published SAT antonym items are considered. Results reveal that the stem word's standard frequency index (SFI) is the most robust predictor of empirical difficulty (as measured by Educational Testing Service's equated delta statistic), distantly followed by the keyed answer word's SFI and part of speech. Across all items, one-third of difficulty variance was explained by this predictor set, confirming the frequency-difficulty relationship reported in studies employing more common words and smaller samples. Prediction was attenuated by the relatively high proportion of words having low frequencies. Presumably, a larger representation of familiar words and more differentiated low frequency values would significantly improve prediction.    These findings suggest that feature-based scaling is an efficient, cost effective means for advancing local development of adaptive assessment systems. A computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system is suggested as one practical, psychometric application of the study's findings. The proposed system would extract verbal stimuli from an electronic word domain and employ the aforementioned word variables as proxies for vocabulary item difficulty. Among the design issues discussed are the automatic construction of vocabulary items, adaptive branching, sequential decision-making, iterative refinement of item calibrations, and the provision of timely output for formative direction of learning and instruction.

T1  - Loudness of quasi-continuous impulse noise
AN  - 303926746
AB  - The loudness of quasi continuous impulse noise has been studied as a function of impulse duration and repetition rate, and the spectral shape and relative level of steady background noise. The measurements were performed on 1-second trains of white-noise bursts with exponentially decaying envelopes. The repetition rates were 5 to 100 Hz. The impulse durations were adjusted so that the duty factor of the impulse train (product of the repetition rate and the effective duration of the impulses) varied from 0.025 to 0.1. Steady white background noise was added at peak-to-background ratios of 10, 20 and 30 dB. The loudness levels of the stimuli relative to a steady white noise reference stimulus at a presentation level of 60.5 dB L$\sb{\rm eq}$ were measured in ten normal-hearing subjects using an adaptive testing procedure.    Under most conditions, the loudness levels of the quasi continuous impulse noise stimuli were best predicted by the equivalent sound pressure level, L$\sb{\rm eq}$, indicating that the "equal energy" relation was followed. At the 50 and 100-Hz repetition rates, the loudness level of the impulse noise test stimuli at the 20 and 30-dB peak-to-background ratios exceeded that of the reference stimulus due to the "roughness effect". The loudness levels of the stimuli at the lower repetition rates, on the other hand, was significantly less than the equal energy prediction at the shortest durations, which suggests that auditory temporal integration depends on the duty factor of the impulse train. The data of experiment 1 were fit by a simple model involving the duty factor of the impulse train and the difference between the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the impulsive component and the L$\sb{\rm eq}$ of the steady background noise component of the test stimuli.    In the second experiment, the spectral shape of the background noise did not significantly affect the point of subjective equality. However, there was a significant interaction between background noise spectrum and peak-to-background noise ratio which was suggestive of a masking process.

T1  - Investigating Differences in Mean Score on Adaptive and Paper and Pencil Versions of the College Level Academic Skills Reading Test
AN  - 63059154; ED319791
AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

T1  - Test Anxiety and Item Order: New Parameters for Item Response Theory
AN  - 63129829; ED307313
AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

T1  - Work hardening, strength, restorative mechanisms, and ductility in the hot working of 300 series stainless steels
AN  - 303829589
AB  - Stress-strain curves, generated through continuous and multistage torsion tests of as-cast and homogenized 301, 304, 316 and 317 $\gamma$ stainless steels in the range of 1200-900$\sp\circ$C and 0.1 to 5.0 s$\sp{\rm -1}$, were analyzed with respect to the characteristics of work hardening, dynamic and static recovery, dynamic and static recrystallization, and ductility. Work hardening was related to the Kocks-Mecking analysis. The associated enthalpy which rose across the deformation range attaining a maximum at the highest temperature, was in close agreement with the constant activation energy determined by sinh analysis.    Dynamic softening mechanisms were analyzed through examination of the flow curves, with conclusions based upon mechanical data being confirmed by optical metallographic methods. Upon attaining a critical strain, dynamic recrystallization DRX was initiated, producing a peak and then softening to a steady state regime. The rate of dynamic softening was determined by means of the Avrami equation. The critical stress and strain for subgrain formation and for DRX were determined from changes in slope of the strain hardening-flow stress $\theta$-$\sigma$ curves. A transition from multiple peak grain coarsening to single peak grain refinement behavior was observed and analyzed.    Static restorative mechanisms were examined by mechanical metallographic methods. Fractional softening was due to both static recovery SRV and static recrystallization SRX. The kinetics were analyzed through use of the Avrami equation. At low strains, the time for 50% SRX was a strong function of strain to the $-2$ power. In addition, the temperature compensated time for SRX depended upon the three-eights power of the Zener-Hollomon parameter for both isothermal and declining temperature T multistage tests.    Simulation of a cross country mill showed that multistage flow curves increased as strain rate rose and as interval time and T declined, particularly below 1050$\sp\circ$C. Since the time between successive planetary rolls is insufficient for any restorative mechanisms to operate, the instantaneous power requirements for the planetary hot rolling mill were determined from continuous flow curves. The results favorably agreed with similar mills installed in both Canada and Japan.

T1  - Local independence and item context in a simulated adaptive version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
AN  - 303794941
AB  - The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was evaluated for Item Response Theory (IRT) assumptions, local independence and parameter invariance in order to determine the feasibility of developing a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version. Three conditions were studied including two simulated CAT versions and a standard version (Form R). A sex difference was noted across all groups, but item order did not otherwise affect scores which were highly correlated with the IRT based scores. After excluding those items which did not fit the model, the local independence assumption generally held across groups, and since the procedure used to assess local independence was also sensitive to multidimensionality, this provides implied support for unidimensionality of the various scales. The procedures used to investigate item order effects and parameter invariance yielded mixed results. Overall, this study provides evidence favorable to a CAT adaptation of the MMPI, and suggestions for further research are discussed.

T1  - The contribution of matric suction to the shear strength of unsaturated soils
AN  - 303722305
AB  - The shear strength of remolded specimens of an unsaturated, silty, copper tailings sand was measured in a triaxial apparatus. Multistage tests were completed under consolidated-drained (CD) conditions, where both the pore air and pore water pressures were controlled, and under constant water content (CW) conditions, where the specimen was drained with respect to the pore air pressure and undrained with respect to the pore water pressure. A triaxial testing system with automatic data capturing capabilities was assembled for the study.    A total of eight specimens were tested, two in a saturated condition and three each under unsaturated CD and CW conditions, respectively. The saturated specimens were staged with respect to increasing effective stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$), while each unsaturated specimen was tested with a constant value of net applied stress ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$), and increasing values of matric suction (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) from stage to stage. The range of net applied stress and matric suction studied was 15 to 150 kPa.    The parameter $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ quantifies the increase in shear strength which can be attributed to the matric suction stress state variable. The results indicated that the intersection of the failure surface with the plane containing the (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) axis was curved over the range of suction studied, and did not differ appreciably between the CD and CW test methods. This demonstrated uniqueness of the failure surface.    When account was made for a slight curvature in the failure surface in the direction of the ($\sigma$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm a}$) axis, the variation in $\phi\sp\prime$ with respect to (u$\sb{\rm a}$ $-$ u$\sb{\rm w}$) was reduced. This supported the concept of independence of the shear strength parameters $\phi\sp\prime$, c$\sp\prime$, and $\phi\sp{\rm b}$ for unsaturated soils, and verified the form of the shear strength equation used in the study (Fredlund, Morgenstern, and Widger, 1978).

T1  - Simulation of hot strip rolling by compression testing: Effect of the variation of strain-rate on the constitutive behaviour of a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel
AN  - 276038323
AB  - The major objective of this investigation was to test experimentally the relative validity of simulating hot strip rolling by compression testing at constant true strain rates under axisymmetric conditions.    For the purpose of the simulation, the material's flow through the roll gap was theoretically modelled.    Isothermal, single- and multi-stage compression tests were carried out on a microprocessor-controlled servohydraulic testing system by using a niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel. Cylindrical specimens were subjected to deformation at rates of strain either constant or varying as during a rolling pass/passes. True stress-true strain flow curves were obtained by correcting the measured stress-strain data for the effect of friction at the specimen/die interface. The constant friction shear factor was determined quantitatively by hot ring tests. Optical microscopy was used to observe the prior austenite microstructures.    Based on the results of single-stage, constant true strain-rate tests, the dependence of the flow strength as a function of strain, rate of strain and temperature was modelled by using an Arrhenius-type equation.    The comparison of the responses of the material to the two types of compression revealed no significant differences between flow curves except at the very end of the tests. This observation agreed with the predictions of the model, which was developed based on the constant strain-rate flow curves, indicating that the material follows a mechanical equation of state in hot rolling processes.    The flow curves and the average flow strengths were compared between the constant and varying strain-rate, four-stage tests. Differences were also found negligible. The variation of the average flow strength during multistage testing was dependent of the length of the interpass time and the average strain rate in a significant manner.    It was found that the microstructures developed from single- as well as multi-stage compression tests were independent of the variation of the strain rate during deformation.    This study showed that the constant true strain-rate compression testing is a very useful technique in simulating hot flat strip rolling processes.

T1  - REMEDIATION IN BASIC SKILLS MATHEMATICS WITH AND WITHOUT COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION (CAI, TUTORING, INDEPENDENT-STUDY)
AN  - 303437375
AB  - This study focused on the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in remedial mathematics when compared with tutoring and independent-study as methods of instruction. In this investigation, the relationship between these three methods of instruction and the ethnicity of the subjects was explored.    Results were measured by analyzing differences in achievement scores as measured by Computer Adaptive Testing and Comparative Guidance Placement. The results showed that there was a significant difference between minority and non-minorities for both tutoring and independent-study. Such differences are frequently encountered and are generally attributable to cultural differences or prior educational experiences, which may cause some minority students to experience emotional and value conflicts in the classroom. This could result in psychological defenses being called into play. No significant differences in test scores were apparent between minorities and non-minorities when using CAI as the method of instruction, indicating that CAI may not activate such defenses.    Results also showed that minorities scored significantly higher in testing after using CAI as a method of instruction than after using tutoring or independent-study methods. This suggests that CAI, when used for remedial instruction in basic skills mathematics, reduces the frequently encountered differences in achievement between minorities and non-minorities. This supports the theory that CAI is multicultural and a value-neutral tool that can assist to alleviate some of these pre-existing problems, thereby enabling minority students to attain greater academic success.

T1  - National Statistics to Improve Educational Productivity
AN  - 63304897; ED272571
AB  - The value of statistical research depends on valid comparisons which can usefully influence educational policy. Educational research needs to extend the measures of learning (such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress) through nationally-calibrated absolute measures and through computer-assisted and adaptive testing. Direct sampling by computer would make educational polls and national assessment faster and less expensive. A national bureau of educational standards might be founded to collect, coordinate, calibrate, archive, analyze, synthesize, and make available the data that is needed to improve educational productivity. Nine factors promoting efficiency and productivity of learning are classified in three broad categories: (1) student aptitude, including ability, development, and motivation; (2) instruction, including amount of time students engage in learning and quality of instructional experience; and (3) environmental factors, such as home climate, classroom social group, peer group, and television viewing. The tables in the appendix illustrate the effect of productivity factors on achievement revealed by quantitative syntheses carried out by a number of investigators in Australia, Canada and the United States during the past decade.

T1  - TEACHER AND STUDENT RESPONSES TO A SYSTEM FOR RATIONAL MEASUREMENT
AN  - 303459373
AB  - Feedback is a key element in the teaching/learning cycle. It tells teachers and students how they are progressing and how effective their instruction/learning has been. Despite the importance of feedback, it is rarely obtained in optimal ways and is poorly understood by teachers and students. The problem lies in ineffective methods of obtaining and utilizing feedback information.    This study has attempted to define, implement, and determine the effects of a set of rational measurement practices. It is based on the premise that testing should be an integral part of teaching, providing information to students and teachers in an efficient and non-intrusive manner. The components for rational measurement include well-written item sets which communicate teachers'expectations to students, individualized selection of items, detailed comments on student answers, and reports portraying the changing relationship of students to items as instruction proceeds. The system utilizes a microcomputer programmed with an algorithm for Rasch measurement and adaptive testing.    Nine classes participated in a study of the effectiveness of the system. After training, each teacher wrote item sets corresponding to two units. Qualitative data were gathered on teachers' use of measurement information for improving teaching practice. Teacher proficiency in writing items was measured. Students within classes were randomly assigned to four groups created by the crossing of a feedback factor and an item selection factor. Students were tested weekly with subsets of items from the set written by the teacher. Ability measures were obtained from each session to determine whether detailed feedback was effective in raising achievement. Attitude and anxiety data were collected at the beginning and end of each unit to assess whether adaptive item selection caused a more positive student reaction to testing.    Data analysis showed that four teachers used the system to improve their teaching. Three teachers displayed positive verbal responses, but did not change practices. Two teachers did not use the measurement information. There was no discernible increase in item-writing proficiency. Analysis of student data showed a nonsignificant positive effect of detailed feedback on student achievement. No difference between selection or feedback groups was observed for any affective measures.

T1  - The stability of a silty clay under repeated loading
AN  - 2312324222
AB  - The object of this research programme was to investigate the stability of a silty clay under undrained repeated loading. Equipment has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading. This model can be used to predict pore pressures and failure for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils.

T1  - Lessons Learned about the Application of Adaptive Testing in Several First-Year University Courses
AN  - 2699690168; EJ1340821
AB  - The adoption of computerised adaptive testing (CAT) instead of classical testing (FIT) raises questions from both teachers' and students' perspectives. The scientific literature shows that teachers using CAT instead of FIT should experience shorter times to complete the assessment and obtain more precise evaluations. As for the students, adaptive testing seems to increase their engagement, whereas the impossibility to revise the already given questions is usually seen as a detrimental characteristic. In such a context, the paper reports on a study concerning the aforementioned points. The outcomes seem almost all inline with the literature: no particular usability issues were detected, CAT is faster than FIT, and CAT does not seem more engaging than FIT. All these findings are reported in the conclusions as a list of suggestions to teachers interested in switching from FIT to CAT.

T1  - The Effectiveness of Adaptive versus Non-Adaptive Learning with Digital Educational Games
AN  - 2458997097; EJ1259861
AB  - For the training of academic skills, digital educational games with integrated adaptivity are promising. Adaptive games are considered superior to non-adaptive games, because they constantly assess children's performance, and accordingly adapt the difficulty of the tasks corresponding to the children's individual level. However, empirical evidence with regard to the effectivity of adaptive compared to non-adaptive games is limited. A study was conducted with 191 children from the third year of Kindergarten who were enrolled in one of three conditions, that is, playing an adaptive version of the reading game (RG), a non-adaptive version of the RG or training with pen-and-paper exercises. In all three conditions, children trained emergent reading (phonological awareness and letter knowledge) once a week for 30?min over a period of 5?weeks. Children's performance on cognitive (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, reading fluency) and non-cognitive (motivation, self-concept) factors was assessed. Results revealed a significant improvement in phonological awareness and letter knowledge in all conditions. However, no differences between the conditions were observed with respect to children's improvement on phonological awareness and letter knowledge or on their post-test scores for reading fluency. With regard to motivation and self-concept, again, no differences in these non-cognitive factors were observed across conditions.

T1  - Classification and Regression Tree and Computer Adaptive Testing in Cardiac Rehabilitation: Instrument Validation Study
AN  - 2737517712
AB  - Background: There is a need for shorter-length assessments that capture patient questionnaire data while attaining high data quality without an undue response burden on patients. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods have the potential to meet these needs and can offer attractive options to shorten questionnaire lengths.
Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether CAT or CART was best suited to reduce the number of questionnaire items in multiple domains (eg, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and social support) used for a needs assessment procedure (NAP) within the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) without the loss of data quality.
Methods: NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a Web-based portal, MyCARDSS, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
Results: With CAT and CART, an overall reduction of 36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length, respectively, was achieved, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT, 0.777 and 0.877 for classification trees, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees, respectively.
Conclusions: Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the NAP used within the field of CR. CART, however, showed the best performance, with a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress in multiple domains. For CR professionals, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their patients by providing real-time patient measurements.

T1  - A Computer Adaptive Measure of Reading Motivation
AN  - 2488224192; ED607640
AB  - Background: The importance of reading motivation has led to the development of a large number of self-report reading motivation measures; however, there is still a need for a usable measure of adolescent reading motivation that captures a large number of theoretically and empirically distinct constructs. Methods: The current paper details the development and validation of a computer adapted measure of reading motivation, the Adaptive Reading Motivation Measure (ARMM), which assesses constructs of curiosity, involvement, interest, value, challenge, grades, recognition, competition, avoidance, self-efficacy, perceived difficulty, preference for autonomy, social motivation, prosocial goals, and antisocial goals for reading. Results: Model fit indicated that hierarchical multidimensional models fit better than models without a hierarchical structure. The validation results indicate that females scored higher than males and younger students scored higher than older students on most ARMM scores when scores were derived using a higher-order model. In addition, these scores correlated significantly to reading behavior, engagement, and achievement and indicated high reliability. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the ARMM would be a valid measure to assess a large number of reading motivation constructs in a short period of time within a classroom setting. [The paper will be published in "Journal of Research in Reading."]

T1  - Stopping Rules for Computer Adaptive Testing When Item Banks Have Nonuniform Information
AN  - 2459005490; EJ1254419
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test (CAT) when the "SE" is less than a threshold, is effective when there are informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient-reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the "SE" threshold has not been reached and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the "SE" stopping rule overall, particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.

T1  - Calibration of an item bank in 474 orthopedic patients using Rasch analysis for computer-adaptive assessment of anxiety
AN  - 2281774362
AB  - Objective:To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test.Design:This is a psychometric study.Setting:The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany.Subjects:A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study.Interventions:Not applicable.Main measures:The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients.Results:The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item–trait interaction (χ2(203) = 172.59; P = .94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits).Conclusion:The unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

T1  - Integrating PROMIS® computerized adaptive tests into a web-based intervention for prostate cancer
AN  - 2222645398
AB  - Objective: This study outlined the implementation and feasibility of delivering PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) using a web-based method to evaluate the impact of a technological adaptation of Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) on the psychosocial functioning of men with advanced prostate cancer (APC) undergoing hormone therapy. Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS® CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS® domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS® anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS® CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

AB  - A decision of whether to move from paper-and-pencil to computer-based tests is based largely on a careful weighing of the potential benefits of a change against its costs, disadvantages, and challenges. This paper briefly discusses the trade-offs involved in making such a transition, and then focuses on a relatively unexplored benefit of computer-based tests -- the control of construct-irrelevant factors that can threaten test score validity. Several unique advantages provided by computer-based tests are described, and how these advantages can be used to manage the effects of several common construct-irrelevant factors is discussed. Ultimately, the potential for expanded control may prove to be one of the most important benefits of computer-based tests.

T1  - Exam Anxiety: Using Paired Adaptive Tests to Reduce Stress in Business Classes
AN  - 2228651872; EJ1203830
AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

T1  - Accuracy of the of the PROMIS-57 questionnaire to identify significant depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients on hemodialysis
AN  - 2088794123
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the accuracy of the depression and anxiety domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 57 item (PROMIS-57) profile questionnaire among hemodialysis patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients undergoing hemodialysis, 113 patients completed the PROMIS-57 (includes PROMIS-29), GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Raw scores of legacy tools were converted to calculated PROMIS T-scores using PROsetta Stone© crosswalk files. A cut off score of 10 on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 identified clinically significant anxiety or depression, respectively. Corresponding PROsetta stone cut ofFs were used to categorize depression and anxiety on the reported PROMIS-57 scales. We computed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values. Cohens Kappa was used to assess degree of agreement between legacy and respective PROMIS domains. Results: Of 113 participants, mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years, 57% were male, 42% white. According to legacy instruments, 13% had moderate to severe anxiety, 27% had depression, while reported PROMIS-57 scores yielded 14% with anxiety and 15% with depression. Calculated anxiety scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.695, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.611, p<0.001) scores. Similarly, calculated depression scores showed strong correlations with reported PROMIS-57 (r=0.627, p<0.001) and PROMIS-29 (r=0.594, p<0.001) scores. Cut off scores generated from legacy instruments for moderate-severe anxiety and depression had high specificity (anxiety=0.93, depression=0.95) and moderate sensitivity (anxiety=0.60, depression=0.43). Kappa values indicated moderate agreement between GAD-7 categorization of anxiety vs PROMIS-57 (K=0.51) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.47); also between PHQ-9 classification of depression versus PROMIS-57 (K=0.45) and PROMIS-29 (K=0.41). Conclusion: The PROMIS-57 depression and anxiety domains are valid self-report tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms among hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to assess if accuracy can be improved by using the computer adaptive testing PROMIS item banks.

T1  - Correlation of PROMIS CAT instruments with Oswestry Disability Index in chiropractic patients
AN  - 2088124940
AB  - Background The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Methods All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient reported outcomes instrument. Results The average time to complete all questions during an office visit was 170 ± 67 s (average ± Stdev) to answer 25 ± 6 questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R2 values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R2 values of 0.5236. Conclusions PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found validate the utility when compared to ODI.

T1  - An Adaptive Test Analysis Based on Students' Motivation
AN  - 2461133504; EJ1195643
AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

T1  - The Achievement Gap or the Engagement Gap? Investigating the Sensitivity of Gaps Estimates to Test Motivation
AN  - 2155985230; EJ1193522
AB  - This study estimated male-female and Black-White achievement gaps without accounting for low test motivation, then compared those estimates to ones that used several approaches to addressing rapid guessing. Researchers investigated two issues: (1) The differences in rates of rapid guessing across subgroups and (2) How much achievement gap estimates change when rapid guessing is addressed. The study used reading and mathematics scores from the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), a test administered in nearly all U.S. states. Results suggest that rapid guessing occurs at very different rates across subgroups. However, rapid guessing generally has a mild effect on gaps estimates, although there are cases where failing to account for low test motivation may be impacting fundamental inferences made based on gaps. As part of the second question, differences across approaches to accounting for rapid guessing were examined. Results suggest that rapid guessing occurs at very different rates across subgroups. However, rapid guessing generally has a mild effect on gaps estimates, although there are cases where failing to account for low test motivation may be impacting fundamental inferences made based on gaps.

T1  - Computer-Adaptive Testing: Implications for Students' Achievement, Motivation, Engagement, and Subjective Test Experience
AN  - 2013521072; EJ1166166
AB  - The present study investigated the implications of computer-adaptive testing (operationalized by way of multistage adaptive testing; MAT) and "conventional" fixed order computer testing for various test-relevant outcomes in numeracy, including achievement, test-relevant motivation and engagement, and subjective test experience. It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students' test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students' test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged.

T1  - ATS-PD: An Adaptive Testing System for Psychological Disorders
AN  - 1969007016; EJ1154541
AB  - The clinical assessment of mental disorders can be a time-consuming and error-prone procedure, consisting of a sequence of diagnostic hypothesis formulation and testing aimed at restricting the set of plausible diagnoses for the patient. In this article, we propose a novel computerized system for the adaptive testing of psychological disorders. The proposed system combines a mathematical representation of psychological disorders, known as the "formal psychological assessment," with an algorithm designed for the adaptive assessment of an individual's knowledge. The assessment algorithm is extended and adapted to the new application domain. Testing the system on a real sample of 4,324 healthy individuals, screened for obsessive-compulsive disorder, we demonstrate the system's ability to support clinical testing, both by identifying the correct critical areas for each individual and by reducing the number of posed questions with respect to a standard written questionnaire.

T1  - Modeling Student Test-Taking Motivation in the Context of an Adaptive Achievement Test
AN  - 1826524730; EJ1092448
AB  - This study examined the utility of response time-based analyses in understanding the behavior of unmotivated test takers. For the data from an adaptive achievement test, patterns of observed rapid-guessing behavior and item response accuracy were compared to the behavior expected under several types of models that have been proposed to represent unmotivated test taking behavior. Test taker behavior was found to be inconsistent with these models, with the exception of the effort-moderated model. Effort-moderated scoring was found to both yield scores that were more accurate than those found under traditional scoring, and exhibit improved person fit statistics. In addition, an effort-guided adaptive test was proposed and shown by a simulation study to alleviate item difficulty mistargeting caused by unmotivated test taking.

T1  - Using the Rasch Model in a Computer Adaptive Testing Application to Enhance the Measurement Quality of Emotional Intelligence
AN  - 2566224349
AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

T1  - The EORTC emotional functioning computerized adaptive test: phases I-III of a cross-cultural item bank development
AN  - 1531918641; 201413633
AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

T1  - New Trends of Measurement and Assessment in Distance Education
AN  - 1651861039; EJ1043023
AB  - Distance education is a discipline that offers solutions to some important education problems. Distance education, contribute to the solution to the problems such as; inequality of opportunities, lifelong education, the implementation of a series of individual and social goals that can contribute to and benefit from educational technology and self-learning. In distance education, methods of measurement and assessment must be consistent with the objectives and contents of teaching. A major interest of formative assessment is determining the students' learning level of each behavior in the interested unit. In summative assessment, performances of students on some units are measured broader than formative assessment. A computerized adaptive testing, CAT, is the test managed by computer in which each item is introduced and the decision to stop are dynamically imposed based on the students answers and his/her estimated knowledge level. In CAT applications, students do not take the same test. Despite item numbers and properties of items are different for the students; the precise of measures improves in positioning students on an ability or success continuum in CAT applications. In CAT applications, questions answered by a student depend on the student's ability or learning level. In item response theory, there are some models to estimate a student's ability level, such as three-parameter logistic model. Cheating in exams or other academic assignments can be defined as use resources not allowed to use or having someone else to take exams or assignments. Some precautions must be taken about cheating such as a live proctoring, using web cams, and using a plagiarism detection program.

T1  - Test Anxiety, Computer-Adaptive Testing and the Common Core
AN  - 1697499495; EJ1054865
AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

T1  - The MMPI-2 Computerized Adaptive Version (MMPI-2-CA) in a Veterans Administration Medical Outpatient Facility
AN  - 1314328688; EJ991778
AB  - The ability to screen quickly and thoroughly for psychological difficulties in existing and returning combat veterans who are seeking treatment for physical ailments would be of significant benefit. In the current study, item and time savings, as well as extratest correlations, associated with an audio-augmented version of the computerized adaptive Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2-CA) are examined in a group of 273 male veterans, ages 26-87 years. Results indicated an average item savings of approximately 103 items (18.6%), with a corresponding time savings of approximately 12 min (24.3%), for the MMPI-2-CA compared with conventional computerized administration of the test, as well as comparability in terms of test-retest coefficients and correlations with external measures. Future directions of adaptive personality testing are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing, Anxiety Levels, and Gender Differences
AN  - 757171388; EJ896744
AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

T1  - Effects of Online Testing on Student Exam Performance and Test Anxiety
AN  - 61797812; EJ873597
AB  - Increased use of course management software to administer course exams online for face-to-face classes raises the question of how well test anxiety and other emotions generalize from the classroom to an online setting. We hypothesized that administering regular course exams in an online format would reduce test anxiety experienced at the time of the exam and improve exam scores. We recruited 69 participants from a psychology course to take classroom- and online-delivered exams, using a counterbalanced crossover design. We found that students who normally experience high levels of test anxiety in the classroom had reduced test anxiety when taking online exams, while the reverse was true for those low in classroom anxiety. Furthermore, the relationship between test anxiety and exam performance was weaker in an online setting than in the classroom. We recommend that instructors evaluate the potential impact of these findings when considering offering examinations online. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

AN  - 61989401; EJ819164
AB  - This article discusses the growing interest in computer-adaptive testing, which supporters say can help guide instruction, increase student motivation, and determine the best use of resources for districts. This method of testing shortens the test by not asking high-achieving students questions that are too easy for them, and likewise not giving struggling students questions that are too hard. However, computer-adaptive assessments are not the best way to evaluate students in every situation, experts point out. Though, they recognize the potential of computer-adaptive testing, experts also voice caution in using this kind of method.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing for Polytomous Motivation Items: Administration Mode Effects and a Comparison with Short Forms
AN  - 62043948; EJ773650
AB  - In a randomized experiment (n = 515), a computerized and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) are compared. The item pool consists of 24 polytomous motivation items. Although items are carefully selected, calibration data show that Samejima's graded response model did not fit the data optimally. A simulation study is done to assess possible consequences of model misfit. CAT efficiency was studied by a systematic comparison of the CAT with two types of conventional fixed length short forms, which are created to be good CAT competitors. Results showed no essential administration mode effects. Efficiency analyses show that CAT outperformed the short forms in almost all aspects when results are aggregated along the latent trait scale. The real and the simulated data results are very similar, which indicate that the real data results are not affected by model misfit. (Contains 2 tables, 6 figures and 5 notes.)

T1  - Measurement of Korean EFL college students' foreign language classroom speaking anxiety: Evidence of psychometric properties and accuracy of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) with dichotomously scored items using a CAT simulation
AN  - 85626294; 200614254
AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

T1  - Factors that affect student performance on the Computer Adaptive Testing National Certification Examination for nurse anesthetists
AN  - 305363312
AB  - The ability to predict the performance of student nurse anesthetists on the Computer Adaptive Testing National Certification Examination (CAT NCE) is an area of concern and interest to nurse anesthesia educators, students, nurse anesthesia administrators, clinicians, and employers. Upon completion of an accredited nurse anesthesia education program, students must successfully pass the CAT NCE in order to practice as a nurse anesthetist. One of the major outcomes of the education of student nurse anesthetists is to provide the community of interest with safe, competent anesthesia practitioners who can pass the CAT NCE.    This study examined 13 academic, demographic, and pre-admission factors, which predict performance on the CAT NCE. This retrospective study reviewed the academic records of 128 student nurse anesthetists who took the CAT NCE between 1996 and 2003. The independent variables included the following: Baccalaureate of Science Degree in Nursing (BSN), nurse anesthesia program grade point average (GPA), age, gender, type of nursing background, number of years of nursing, type of BSN program (traditional, completion), and number of clinical cases and case hours in the nurse anesthesia program. The dependent variable was overall CAT NCE score.    Results of the multiple regression analysis determined that 2 of the 13 independents variables were predictive of student performance on the CAT NCE. These variables included BSN GPA and type of BSN program, which accounted for 15.5% of the variance in overall CAT NCE scores. In addition, a strong positive correlation existed between BSN GPA and CAT NCE scores. All of the other remaining variables showed no significance in the multiple regression or correlation analyses.    The results of this study will be used to examine and further define the admission criteria and curriculum requirements for nurse anesthesia education programs. In the computerized version of the NCE, each candidate's examination is individualized, allowing the results of the examination to be based on the student's individual knowledge, skills, and abilities to determine individual competence. The computer adaptive version of the NCE more precisely determines competence by testing each individual according to his or her abilities.

T1  - Comparing Restricted and Unrestricted Self-Adapted Testing as Alternatives to Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62449718; ED423258
AB  - Previous studies have shown that, when administered a self-adapted test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a self-adapted test--lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT)--can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted self-adapted test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only in the region of their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class. The results show that while the RS-AT effectively controlled the standard errors of proficiency estimation, examinees receiving an RS-AT did not show higher mean proficiency or lower posttest state anxiety than examinees receiving a CAT.

T1  - Overview of Practical Issues in a CAT Program
AN  - 62624506; ED408330
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has become increasingly common in large-scale testing programs. This paper considers relevant practical issues that are likely to be faced by the developers and managers of a CAT program. The first cluster of issues is that of item pool development and maintenance. It includes such considerations as item pool specifications, the choice of item response theory model, and other concerns in constructing and choosing test items. The second cluster of items involves administering and scoring the CAT. Proficiency estimation method, test items, item review, and equating CAT scores to paper-and-pencil tests are areas that must be considered. The third cluster involves protecting the integrity of the CAT item pool, considering security and coaching concerns. A fourth cluster includes issues involving examinees. These issues (whether or not to allow item review, how to set time limits, how to address examinee anxiety, test taker motivation, and test equity) are areas that must be explored for fair and useful tests.

T1  - Examinee Issues in CAT
AN  - 62603310; ED408329
AB  - The perspective of the examinee during the administration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is discussed, focusing on issues of test development. Item review is the first issue discussed. Virtually no CATs provide the opportunity for the examinee to go back and review, and possibly change, answers. There are arguments on either side of the item review issue, and test givers should weigh them carefully, considering examinee anxiety and performance factors. Another issue is that of time limits, which have little benefit for test takers, but serve only the interests of test givers. CAT developers should consider very liberal time limits or none at all, especially since a CAT is shorter than its conventional testing counterparts. Test anxiety may be increased in a CAT environment, and test developers should be aware of the potential for anxiety among examinees. Another issue is that of examinee motivation. CAT developers should be aware of the effects of test consequences on test performance to ensure that data used to calibrate item banks are collected under conditions that have the same consequences as the operational test. Equity is an important issue in CAT, since some examinees will have less computer experience than others. Each of these issues has implications for the validity of inferences made from CAT scores and should be considered when CATs are used. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)

T1  - The Influence of Examinee Test-Taking Motivation in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62656885; ED392839
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Korean college students (n=208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (motivated and non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) under the counterbalanced design at the computer laboratory. They were also given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale, a 10-item computer test anxiety scale, and a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing. A multivariate analysis of covariance, with the math aptitude and the test anxiety as covariates, demonstrated that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes.

T1  - The effects of computerized adaptive testing and examinee test motivation on algebra skills, test anxiety, and attitudes
AN  - 304160034
AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance.    Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables.    This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance.    The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

T1  - Effects of Informed Item Selection on Test Performance and Anxiety for Examinees Administered a Self-Adapted Test
AN  - 62809013; ED372075
AB  - In self-adapted testing (SAT), examinees select the difficulty level of items administered. This study investigated three variations of prior information provided when taking an SAT: (1) no information (examinees selected item difficulty levels without prior information); (2) view (examinees inspected a typical item from each difficulty level prior to taking the SAT); and (3) route (examinees answered a typical item from each difficulty level and were informed prior to the SAT of the level that best matched their performance). Subjects were 218 students in an introductory statistics course, 85 percent of whom were undergraduates. No significant differences in test performance or anxiety were found as a function of providing examinees more information. Four tables are included. (Contains 9 references.) (Author/SLD)

T1  - Comparing Computerized Adaptive and Self-Adapted Tests: The Influence of Examinee Achievement Locus of Control
AN  - 62798906; ED371007
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between examinee achievement-specific locus of control and the differences between self-adapted testing (SAT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in terms of mean estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. Subjects were 379 college students. A disordinal interaction was found between test type and locus of control. Examinees with an internal locus of control were affected positively by the SAT (relative to the CAT). For examinees with an external locus of control, however, the SAT appeared to have a negative effect on both estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety. There are four tables and two figures.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing Exploring Examinee Response Time Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling
AN  - 62566300; ED400287
AB  - Examinee response times from a computerized adaptive test taken by 204 examinees taking a certification examination were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Two equations were posed: a within-person model and a between-person model. Variance within persons was eight times greater than variance between persons. Several variables significantly predicted within-person variance. Response time increased with increasing items, test length, and increasing relative item difficulty. Item sequence was negatively related to response time, and some content areas required more time than others. Examinees spent more time on items they got wrong than on items they got right, and they took longer to respond when the correct answer was A, B, or C than when the correct answer was D. Only one variable, test anxiety, significantly predicted variance between examinees. Examinee age, sex, first language, and ethnicity did not predict between-person variance, and low-ability examinees did not take longer to respond to items than high-ability examinees. Understanding how item characteristics impact on response time may allow test developers to allot total test time based on the response time history of the individual test items. This study also suggests that examinee characteristics are generally not related to response time, but that more controllable factors such as item length, position of the keyed correct answer, and use of figures do contribute to response items. An appendix contains the anxiety survey. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)

T1  - Individual Differences in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62803573; ED365713
AB  - Research on the major computerized adaptive testing (CAT) strategies is reviewed, and some findings are reported that examine effects of examinee demographic and psychological characteristics on CAT strategies. In fixed branching strategies, all examinees respond to a common routing test, the score of which is used to assign examinees to a second-stage test. The currently popular statistically branched adaptive strategies are based on item-response theory, and include maximum likelihood strategy and Bayesian strategy. Two alternative strategies are the use of self-adapted testing and testlet strategies. Examinee characteristic variables are divided into: (1) demographic variables; (2) computer-use variables; (3) test-taking strategy variables; (4) cognitive characteristics; and (5) affective characteristics. Although research on the relationship between examinee psychological characteristics and CAT has been inconclusive, the basic findings are that examinees of different ethnic, gender, age, grade, ability, academic self-concept, test anxiety, computer anxiety, math anxiety, and computer experience groups are differentially affected by the adaptive testing strategies. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (Contains 67 references.) (SLD)

T1  - An Investigation of Restricted Self-Adapted Testing
AN  - 62872992; ED358153
AB  - A new testing strategy that provides protection against the problem of having examinees in adaptive testing choose difficulty levels that are not matched to their proficiency levels was introduced and evaluated. The method, termed restricted self-adapted testing (RSAT), still provides examinees with a degree of control over the difficulty levels of their test items. The range of item choice is restricted to a region around the examinee's current proficiency estimate. Participants in this study were 186 students in grades 3 through 8 in the Portland (Oregon) Public School system during the winter of 1992-93, who were tested as part of an ongoing computerized adaptive testing program. Students were randomly assigned to a computerized adaptive test (CAT), a self-adaptive test (SADT), or RSAT in mathematics. Results indicate no differences between CAT and SADT conditions in terms of mean proficiency and mean posttest state anxiety. The basic RSAT method appears to hold promise for providing examinees with control over the testing situation, while preventing large mismatches between item difficulty choice and proficiency level. The RSAT procedure should be evaluated empirically. (SLD)

T1  - The Role of Anxiety in Examinee Preference for Self-Adapted Testing
AN  - 62867202; ED358154
AB  - This study assessed whether providing examinees with a choice between computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and self-adaptive testing (SAT) affects test performance in comparison with being assigned a CAT or SAT, and evaluated variables influencing examinee choice of either test form. The relative influences of test type and test choice on examinee anxiety were also examined. Subjects were 244 undergraduate and 133 graduate students from a large midwestern university. Students were randomly assigned to SAT, CAT, and choice conditions for an algebra test. Test-related anxiety was assessed with a paper-and-pencil measure in pretests and posttests. It was found that, for students with high mathematics anxiety, providing a choice between CAT and SAT led to significantly higher mean proficiency estimates, lending support to the hypothesis that examinees can cope with a stressful situation more effectively if they feel that they have some control over the source of the stress. Expected differences in estimated proficiency and posttest state anxiety between CAT and SAT conditions were not found, but a strong relationship was seen between examinee test type choice and mathematics anxiety level. Higher anxiety examinees have a greater preference for the control provided by SAT. Six tables and two graphs summarize findings. (SLD)

T1  - Effects of computerized adaptive test anxiety on nursing licensure examination
AN  - 304041739
AB  - Purpose of study. This study was to determine if nursing candidates for licensure experienced an increase in anxiety due to the administration of an examination by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second purpose was to discover if certain groups were "at risk" of experiencing computer test anxiety.    Method. This study was a two-group, experimental design conducted concurrently with the CAT-NCLEX simulation. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing selected practical nursing graduates and repeat examinees to participate in a field test of the Computerized Adaptive Testing of the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The experimental group for this study participated in the CAT simulation activity prior to taking NCLEX-PN and the control group did so after NCLEX-PN.    Both groups completed a 17 item Self-Report Anxiety Questionnaire. The responses were summed; the total score was considered to be a measure of anxiety.    Findings. Analysis of the data indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in computer test anxiety between the two groups. This is not to infer that there was no computer test anxiety expressed but rather that there was virtually no difference in the level of anxiety reported by the experimental group and the control group.    Further analysis of data indicated that persons with previous computer experience reported higher levels of computer test anxiety than those without previous computer experience and that females reported themselves as experiencing higher levels of computer test anxiety than did males. The results did not indicate that minorities experienced higher levels of computer test anxiety than non-minority groups. Lastly, there was no correlation between nursing grade point average or age and levels of computer test anxiety.    Conclusion. Participation in a computerized testing simulation did not affect the level of computer test anxiety. The only groups to experience higher levels of computer test anxiety are females and those with previous computer experience.

T1  - Test Anxiety and Test Performance Under Computerized Adaptive Testing Methods
AN  - 62934912; ED344910
AB  - Little research exists on the psychological impacts of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and how it may affect test performance. Three CAT procedures were examined, in which items were selected to match students' achievement levels, from the item pool at random, or according to student choice of item difficulty levels. Twenty-four graduate students (5 males and 19 females) at Indiana University (Richmond) were randomly assigned to one of six testing orders formed by the three mastery test approaches and by blocking on native and non-native speakers. While at a computer, students received a description of adaptive testing methods and then a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. Right after completing each test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale, ranked their preferences among tests, and evaluated their performance on each of the tests. No statistically significant mean differences were found among mean student achievement scores or among in-test anxiety means under the three adaptive testing methods. Students reporting higher anxiety scored significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Those preferring the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most were less anxious during those tests. Instead of actual performance, students' perceptions of how well they did were significantly correlated with preference rankings for the tests. The matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach decisions than did the random-selection tests. Ten tables, 1 figure, and a 19-item list of references are included.

T1  - How Review Options and Administration Modes Influence Scores on Computerized Vocabulary Tests
AN  - 62917480; ED346161
AB  - The effects of review options (the opportunity for examinees to review and change answers) on the magnitude, reliability, efficiency, and concurrent validity of scores obtained from three types of computerized vocabulary tests (fixed item, adaptive, and self-adapted) were studied. Subjects were 97 college students at a large midwestern university who each completed one of the vocabulary tests and several measures of attitudes about review, item difficulty, and test anxiety. Review modestly enhanced test performance, slightly decreased measurement precision, moderately increased total testing time, affected concurrent validity, and was strongly favored by examinees. Computerized tests do not necessarily yield equivalent results, and such tests may have to be equated to ensure fair use of test scores. Differences in performance favoring paper-and-pencil tests in some prior studies occurred because review options were excluded from the computerized tests. Results for administration mode are inconclusive. Compared to the other types, the fixed-item test yielded the least desirable results because scores were lowest, least reliable, and most susceptible to test anxiety effects. The choice between self-adapted and adaptive tests seems to depend on examinee anxiety level. Item difficulty suggestion, rather than answer feedback, is the predominant factor facilitating performance on self-adapted tests. Included are 3 tables, 4 graphs, and 38 references. (SLD)

T1  - The Effects of Feedback in Computerized Adaptive and Self-Adapted Tests
AN  - 62836266; ED352391
AB  - Computerized adaptive (CA) testing uses an algorithm to match examinee ability to item difficulty, while self-adapted (SA) testing allows the examinee to choose the difficulty of his or her items. Research comparing SA and CA testing has shown that examinees experience lower anxiety and improved performance with SA testing. All previous research concerning SA testing has presented item feedback to the examinee before asking the examinee to choose the next item difficulty level. Moreover, item feedback has typically not been presented to examinees in previous CA testing research. The effects of presenting, versus withholding, item feedback in SA tests were studied for 135 graduate and 228 undergraduate students (128 males and 235 females). The instrument was a computerized algebra test to assess skills needed for a statistics class. Examinees administered the SA tests tended to obtain significantly higher ability estimates than did those who were administered the CA tests. Also, those taking the SA tests reported significantly lower post-test state anxiety than did those taking the CA tests. Interaction between test type and feedback was not found, suggesting that examinees are able to use the implicit feedback they receive when answering items. Five tables present study findings. (SLD)

T1  - The effect of adaptive testing item selection methods on the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation
AN  - 304000167
AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty.    The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data.    Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

T1  - Correlates of Examinee Item Choice Behavior in Self-Adapted Testing
AN  - 63001252; ED331889
AB  - The strategies examinees employ when making item difficulty level choices in self-adapted computerized testing were investigated. Subjects were 148 college students (88 females and 60 males) in an introductory statistics course. The primary instrument was a self-adapted computerized algebra test used to measure student readiness for the statistics course. Each examinee was administered 20 items from a pool of 93. Students rated their self-efficacy before the test and were administered measures of mathematics anxiety and test anxiety. Inspection of each student's data file provided an indicator of selection strategy. Examinees who chose a more difficult first test item expressed greater capability and higher confidence, reported less anxiety just prior to testing, and less anxiety about mathematics in general. When selecting additional items, examinees tended toward what was termed a sluggishly flexible strategy; they chose more difficult items after passing an item or string of items, and chose less difficult items after failing a single item or string of items. The most frequent choice was to remain at the same level. Results indicate that self-adaptive testing may be a viable alternative to computerized adaptive testing. Two figures and two tables contain data from the study. (SLD)

T1  - A Comparison of Self-Adapted and Computer-Adaptive Tests
AN  - 63001134; ED331888
AB  - According to item response theory (IRT), examinee ability estimation is independent of the particular set of test items administered from a calibrated pool. Although the most popular application of this feature of IRT is computerized adaptive (CA) testing, a recently proposed alternative is self-adapted (SA) testing, in which examinees choose the difficulty level of each of their test items. Examinee performance was compared under CA and SA testing conditions for college students from an introductory statistics course. Three test forms were developed, testing mathematical knowledge necessary for the course. The final pool contained 93 items which were administered to 204 subjects. The SA test yielded significantly higher ability scores, and examinees taking the SA test reported significantly lower posttest state anxiety. Implications of the differences between the two test types for measurement practice are discussed. Three tables present study data. (Author/SLD)

T1  - Individual Differences in Computer Adaptive Testing: Anxiety, Computer Literacy and Satisfaction
AN  - 62563471; ED400285
AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

T1  - Test anxiety and test performance under computerized adaptive testing methods
AN  - 303923651
AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection).    Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited.    No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.

T1  - Investigating Differences in Mean Score on Adaptive and Paper and Pencil Versions of the College Level Academic Skills Reading Test
AN  - 63059154; ED319791
AB  - Possible causes of a 16-point mean score increase for the computer adaptive form of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) in reading over the paper-and-pencil test (PPT) in reading are examined. The adaptive form of the CLAST was used in a state-wide field test in which reading, writing, and computation scores for approximately 1,000 students were compared for the March or June 1988 administrations of the PPT and the spring of 1988 administration of the computer adaptive test (CAT) version. The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis. Overall results indicate that students should be allowed a longer testing period for the CAT version of the CLAST than for the PPT version. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)

AB  - Examinees (N=1,233) at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation (JOCRF) were administered one of three test forms in which only item order differed. The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety; (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance. Three tables and nine graphs present study data. A 55-item list of references is provided. (TJH)

T1  - Individual Differences in Item Selection in Computerized Self Adapted Testing
AN  - 63023394; ED310136
AB  - In self-adapted testing, examinees are allowed to choose the difficulty of each item to be presented immediately before attempting it. Previous research has demonstrated that self-adapted testing leads to better performance than do fixed-order tests and is preferred by examinees. The present study examined the strategies that 29 college students used in selecting items during a self-adapted test. After completing the Test Anxiety Inventory, subjects took the self-adapted test. The test contained 40 items sorted into 8 categories of difficulty based on Rasch model estimates. Three test-taking strategies were identified. Most subjects adopted a flexible strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and harder items following success. Some subjects adopted a "failure intolerant" strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and items of the same difficulty after success. Finally, some subjects adopted a "failure tolerant" strategy in which they chose items of the same difficulty level after failure, but harder items after success. The failure-tolerant strategy was associated with lower estimated ability than were the other two strategies. This finding may reflect the attributions examinees adopting that strategy make and the effort they expend following failures. The results provide general support for the value of continued development of self-adapted testing. (Author/TJH)

T1  - Interactive Computer Administration of a Spatial Reasoning Test. Research Report 80-2
AN  - 63605265; ED191892
AB  - A pilot study on the development and administration of a test using a spatial reasoning problem, the 15-puzzle, is described. The test utilizes on-line capabilities of a real-time computer to record an examinee's progress on each problem through a sequence of problem-solving "moves", and to collect additional on-line data that might be of relevance to the evaluation of examinee performance. The examinees, 61 students in an introductory psychology class, were required to type a sequence of moves that would bring an array of scrambled numbers (start configuration) into agreement with a second array (goal configuration), using as few moves as possible. Results suggest that four performance indices might be useful in indexing problem difficulty: (1) mean number of moves in the sample; (2) proportion of students solving the problem; (3) proportion of students solving the problem in the optimal number of moves; and (4) a Special Difficulty Index, defined as the sample mean number of moves divided by the minimum number of moves required. Additional methods of scoring test and individual problem performance are studied. (Author/RL)

T1  - The Effects of Knowledge of Results and Test Difficulty on Ability Test Performance and Psychological Reactions to Testing. Research Report 78-2
AN  - 63755844; ED166232
AB  - Volunteer college students were assigned to one of six computer administered vocabulary tests, one half with immediate knowledge of results (KR) after responding to each item, and the other half without knowledge of results. The six tests were designed to be at one of three levels of difficulty and consisted either of 50 preselected items (conventional testing) or tailored on the basis of previous candidate responses (stradaptive testing). Results indicated that the mean maximum-likelihood estimates of individuals' ability varied as a joint function of the KR condition and of test difficulty. Students in the KR condition scored higher than the other students on the most difficult test and lower on the least difficult test. Questionnaire results indicated that, although the students perceived the differences in test difficulty, there were not shown to be any effects on mean student anxiety or motivation scores attributable to test difficulty alone. Students in general reacted very favorably to receiving immediate knowledge of results and its provision increased the mean level of reported motivation. (Author/CTM)

T1  - Testing and the Public Interest
AN  - 63833992; ED150191
AB  - The 1976 Educational Testing Service (ETS) Invitational Conference served as a platform for individuals who have been prominent in educational measurement and research to present their views on issues surrounding the testing controversy. The 1976 ETS "The Testing Scene: Chaos and Controversy," presents a historical review of events surrounding the testing controversy. In "Test Theory and the Public Interest," Frederic M. Lord suggested three alternatives for solving some of the problems of cultural test bias: weighted scoring techniques, tailored testing, and item sampling. Esther E. Diamond discussed test construction techniques that could alleviate bias, in "Testing: The Baby and the Bath Water Are Still With Us." In "One Man's View of Testing," William Raspberry stated that norming contributes to cultural bias. Thelma T. Daley discussed the effects of testing on students, in "The Student and Testing." In the final paper, "Where Ignorance Is Bliss--'Tis Folly to be Testing," Robert L. Thorndike recommended that tests be evaluated in light of the decisions that will be based upon their results. (BW)

T1  - Exam Anxiety: Using Paired Adaptive Tests to Reduce Stress in Business Classes
AN  - 2228651872; EJ1203830
AB  - To reduce test-taking anxiety among businesses students, a Paired Adaptive Test (PAT) system was developed that allows students two chances to answer exam questions. In the study 46 students from three sections of Survey of International Business at Utah Valley University were given exams using the PAT. At the end of the semester, students were asked to complete a survey on test-taking anxiety for that class and other classes. The results indicated a twelve percent lower test-taking anxiety overall score for the PAT system and as much as 20.85% lower scores for questions key to taking specific exams. The implications of this research are that the PAT method could significantly reduce exam anxiety for students while providing a good assessment of their subject knowledge.

T1  - An Adaptive Test Analysis Based on Students' Motivation
AN  - 2461133504; EJ1195643
AB  - Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is now widely used. However, inserting new items into the question bank of a CAT requires a great effort that makes impractical the wide application of CAT in classroom teaching. One solution would be to use the tacit knowledge of the teachers or experts for a pre-classification and calibrate during the execution of tests with these items. Thus, this research consists of a comparative case study between a Stratified Adaptive Test (SAT), based on the tacit knowledge of a teacher, and a CAT based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The tests were applied in seven Computer Networks courses. The results indicate that levels of "anxiety" expressed in the use of the SAT were better than those using the CAT, in addition to being simpler to implement. In this way, it is recommended the implementation of a SAT, where the strata are initially based on the tacit knowledge of the teacher and later, as a result of an IRT calibration.

T1  - Computer-Adaptive Testing: Implications for Students' Achievement, Motivation, Engagement, and Subjective Test Experience
AN  - 2013521072; EJ1166166
AB  - The present study investigated the implications of computer-adaptive testing (operationalized by way of multistage adaptive testing; MAT) and "conventional" fixed order computer testing for various test-relevant outcomes in numeracy, including achievement, test-relevant motivation and engagement, and subjective test experience. It did so among N = 12,736 Australian elementary (years 3 and 5) and secondary (years 7 and 9) school students. Multilevel modeling assessed the extent to which Level 1 (student) test condition (fixed order vs. adaptive), gender, and year group factors and Level 2 (school) socioeducational advantage, location, structure, and size factors predicted students' test-relevant outcomes. In terms of statistically significant main effects, students in the computer-adaptive testing condition generated lower achievement error rates (i.e., higher measurement precision). Other statistically significant computer-adaptive test effects emerged as a function of year-level and gender, with positive effects of computer-adaptive testing being relatively greater for females and older students: these students achieved more highly (year 9 students), reported higher test-relevant motivation and engagement (year 9 students), and reported more positive subjective test experience (females and year 9 students). These findings (a) confirm that computer-adaptive testing yields greater achievement measurement precision, (b) suggest some positive test-relevant motivation and engagement effects from computer-adaptive testing, (c) counter claims that computer-adaptive testing reduces students' test-relevant motivation, engagement, and subjective experience, and (d) suggest positive computer-adaptive testing effects for older students at a developmental stage when they are typically less motivated and engaged.

T1  - Using the Rasch Model in a Computer Adaptive Testing Application to Enhance the Measurement Quality of Emotional Intelligence
AN  - 2566224349
AB  - Background: The use of objective measurement via Rasch models in self-report scales has increased in the recent past, which in turn has enabled the development of computer adaptive tests (CATs). Despite significant advances in both objective measurement and computer adaptive applications few studies have ventured into the personality domain and the emergent field of emotional intelligence. The development of CATs of personality attributes holds advantages such as the reduction in items used for the assessment, reduction of respondent fatigue, and greater cooperation from respondents in the assessment. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive test of the trait Self-control sub-scale of a trait-based emotional intelligence inventory (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: TEIQue). Secondary objectives were to examine the functioning of the CAT by (a) comparing the CAT with a static version, and (b) to establish a practical approach to developing a computer adaptive solution to existing static fixed format self-report inventories. Research design: Participants were 681 working South African adults who participated in a local validation research project of the TEIQue. All respondents completed an informed consent form indicating willingness to participate in the research process. The self-control scale consists of 31 items. Each item employs a 7-point Likert-type response format. The data analysis entailed three steps. Step 1 focussed on establishing a benchmark based on the static measurement of trait based self-control. The analysis entailed calibrating and composing a core self-control item bank by means of a Rasch rating scale analysis. The Rasch analysis focussed on how well the observed data fitted the measurement model and identifying items that meet the criteria for inclusion into the item bank. The data were analysed for individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and differential item functioning across gender. Items that did not meet the criteria for good fit were excluded from the item bank. The rating scale analysis yielded 16 items that met the requirements of the Rasch model. These items constituted the static item bank. Step 2 involved obtaining person measures and standard errors for the static item bank. Step 3 involved a post hoc CAT simulation of the responses of the 681 persons to the 16 items, where different item selection criteria and stopping rules were applied to obtain CAT based person measures and standard errors. All simulations were carried out with the Firestar software. The aim of this step was to evaluate the correspondence between static person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the full item bank) and adaptive person measures (i.e. measures obtained with the simulated CAT). Main findings: Overall, high correlations were found between person measures of the static inventory and the CAT version. With a 13 out of 16 item strategy a very high correlation (r = .97) was obtained. The 7 out of 16 item strategy yielded a satisfactory, but somewhat weaker result (r = .91). Results showed that on average about ten items were required to obtain a standard error of person measures < .40. Different initial item starting and subsequent item selection strategies yielded largely similar results with no one single strategy clearly appearing to be the best strategy.

T1  - The EORTC emotional functioning computerized adaptive test: phases I-III of a cross-cultural item bank development
AN  - 1531918641; 201413633
AB  - The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. On the basis of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

T1  - Test Anxiety, Computer-Adaptive Testing and the Common Core
AN  - 1697499495; EJ1054865
AB  - This paper highlights the current findings and issues regarding the role of computer-adaptive testing in test anxiety. The computer-adaptive test (CAT) proposed by one of the Common Core consortia brings these issues to the forefront. Research has long indicated that test anxiety impairs student performance. More recent research indicates that taking a test in a CAT format can affect the ability estimates of students with test anxiety. Inaccurate measures of ability are disconcerting because of the threat they pose to the validity of test score interpretation. This paper raises concerns regarding how the implementation of a computer-adaptive test for a large-scale common core assessment system could differentially affect students with test anxiety. Issues of fairness and score comparability are raised, and the implications of these issues are discussed.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing, Anxiety Levels, and Gender Differences
AN  - 757171388; EJ896744
AB  - This study compares the amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the state test anxiety experienced between males and females. Ninety-four middle school CAT examinees were compared to 65 middle school P&P examinees on their responses to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) after taking a standardized achievement test. Results of a multiple regression showed that P&P examinees had a higher mean STAIC score than CAT examinees after controlling for trait test anxiety and computer anxiety. Evidence of neither a main nor a moderator effect of gender was found. However, a subsequent path analysis gave evidence of an indirect effect of gender on STAIC score mediated by trait test anxiety. Results are discussed in the context of stereotype threat and the implications for the use of CAT in schools, given the digital divide between race and socioeconomic status. Recommendations for future research and practice are offered.

T1  - Computerized Adaptive Testing for Polytomous Motivation Items: Administration Mode Effects and a Comparison with Short Forms
AN  - 62043948; EJ773650
AB  - In a randomized experiment (n = 515), a computerized and a computerized adaptive test (CAT) are compared. The item pool consists of 24 polytomous motivation items. Although items are carefully selected, calibration data show that Samejima's graded response model did not fit the data optimally. A simulation study is done to assess possible consequences of model misfit. CAT efficiency was studied by a systematic comparison of the CAT with two types of conventional fixed length short forms, which are created to be good CAT competitors. Results showed no essential administration mode effects. Efficiency analyses show that CAT outperformed the short forms in almost all aspects when results are aggregated along the latent trait scale. The real and the simulated data results are very similar, which indicate that the real data results are not affected by model misfit. (Contains 2 tables, 6 figures and 5 notes.)

T1  - Measurement of Korean EFL college students' foreign language classroom speaking anxiety: Evidence of psychometric properties and accuracy of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) with dichotomously scored items using a CAT simulation
AN  - 85626294; 200614254
AB  - Assessment of foreign language speaking anxiety is considered pertinent to assisting practitioners to reduce learners' speaking anxiety. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of severity of speaking anxiety has potential advantages over conventional paper-and-pencil (P&P) tests in terms of efficiency, precision, adaptiveness and real-time severity monitoring. Item response theory (IRT) was applied to obtain item characteristics (i.e. anxiety severity and discrimination parameter) and develop an item pool that can be used for a computerized adaptive test to measure severity of speaking anxiety. Based on two-parameter logistic IRT model, the study analyzed responses to a newly constructed English speaking anxiety inventory from a sample of 949 Korean EFL undergraduate students. The study used Principal Component Analysis and DIMTEST in a confirmatory mode to account for construct validity and conducted a computer simulation of CAT to investigate whether a CAT or a P&P test can more accurately estimate test-takers' severity levels of English speaking anxiety, conditional on their true severity of speaking anxiety. Examining construct validity, the results indicated that a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that 23 percent of the total variation in the data was accounted for by the first component, which exceeds the 20 percent criterion established by Reckase (1979) for assuming unidimensionality and that Cognitive Speaking Anxiety (CSA) items were not dimensionally separable from the Psychosomatic Speaking Anxiety (PSA) items. The study established a pool of 142 items that can be used for a computerized adaptive speaking anxiety severity test. Results of a CAT simulation indicate that a 20-item simulated fixed-length CAT provides better accuracy than that of a P&P test.

T1  - Factors that affect student performance on the Computer Adaptive Testing National Certification Examination for nurse anesthetists
AN  - 305363312
AB  - The ability to predict the performance of student nurse anesthetists on the Computer Adaptive Testing National Certification Examination (CAT NCE) is an area of concern and interest to nurse anesthesia educators, students, nurse anesthesia administrators, clinicians, and employers. Upon completion of an accredited nurse anesthesia education program, students must successfully pass the CAT NCE in order to practice as a nurse anesthetist. One of the major outcomes of the education of student nurse anesthetists is to provide the community of interest with safe, competent anesthesia practitioners who can pass the CAT NCE.    This study examined 13 academic, demographic, and pre-admission factors, which predict performance on the CAT NCE. This retrospective study reviewed the academic records of 128 student nurse anesthetists who took the CAT NCE between 1996 and 2003. The independent variables included the following: Baccalaureate of Science Degree in Nursing (BSN), nurse anesthesia program grade point average (GPA), age, gender, type of nursing background, number of years of nursing, type of BSN program (traditional, completion), and number of clinical cases and case hours in the nurse anesthesia program. The dependent variable was overall CAT NCE score.    Results of the multiple regression analysis determined that 2 of the 13 independents variables were predictive of student performance on the CAT NCE. These variables included BSN GPA and type of BSN program, which accounted for 15.5% of the variance in overall CAT NCE scores. In addition, a strong positive correlation existed between BSN GPA and CAT NCE scores. All of the other remaining variables showed no significance in the multiple regression or correlation analyses.    The results of this study will be used to examine and further define the admission criteria and curriculum requirements for nurse anesthesia education programs. In the computerized version of the NCE, each candidate's examination is individualized, allowing the results of the examination to be based on the student's individual knowledge, skills, and abilities to determine individual competence. The computer adaptive version of the NCE more precisely determines competence by testing each individual according to his or her abilities.

T1  - The Influence of Examinee Test-Taking Motivation in Computerized Adaptive Testing
AN  - 62656885; ED392839
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Korean college students (n=208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (motivated and non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) under the counterbalanced design at the computer laboratory. They were also given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale, a 10-item computer test anxiety scale, and a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing. A multivariate analysis of covariance, with the math aptitude and the test anxiety as covariates, demonstrated that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes.

T1  - The effects of computerized adaptive testing and examinee test motivation on algebra skills, test anxiety, and attitudes
AN  - 304160034
AB  - The major purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of test method and test motivation on estimated ability, test anxiety, and attitudes toward computerized adaptive testing (CAT). This research also examined the relationships between examinees' individual difference variables and computerized adaptive test performance.    Korean college students (n = 208) were given the Math Aptitude Test, Math Self-Concept Scale, Math Test Anxiety Scale, Computer Competence Instrument, Computer Anxiety Scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory in the regular classroom. The two groups (Motivated and Non-motivated) were randomly assigned by each course section. The motivated group was given special test instructions. The paper-and-pencil test (PPT) and the CAT algebra tests were given to each group in random order (PPT-CAT or CAT-PPT) at the computer laboratory. Students were given a 10-item paper test anxiety scale after taking the PPT, and a 10-item computer test anxiety scale after taking the CAT. Finally, they were given a paper-and-pencil version of the Questionnaire on Computerized Adaptive Testing and Computer Experience Questionnaire. The examinees' test motivation was the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The six dependent variables were two estimated algebra skills (PPT and CAT), two test anxiety scores (PPT and CAT), and two CAT attitudes scores. The covariates were the math aptitude and the test anxiety variables.    This study demonstrated the equivalence between the PPT and the CAT and found that test motivation influenced improvement in estimated ability and reduction in test anxiety, but did not affect CAT attitudes. It was found that math aptitude and test motivation variables could be the most significant predictors of computerized adaptive test performance.    The findings suggest that test motivation is an important factor to help explain students' achievement. Further research should focus on how to enhance students' motivation in classroom learning as well as on tests.

T1  - Effects of computerized adaptive test anxiety on nursing licensure examination
AN  - 304041739
AB  - Purpose of study. This study was to determine if nursing candidates for licensure experienced an increase in anxiety due to the administration of an examination by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second purpose was to discover if certain groups were "at risk" of experiencing computer test anxiety.    Method. This study was a two-group, experimental design conducted concurrently with the CAT-NCLEX simulation. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing selected practical nursing graduates and repeat examinees to participate in a field test of the Computerized Adaptive Testing of the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The experimental group for this study participated in the CAT simulation activity prior to taking NCLEX-PN and the control group did so after NCLEX-PN.    Both groups completed a 17 item Self-Report Anxiety Questionnaire. The responses were summed; the total score was considered to be a measure of anxiety.    Findings. Analysis of the data indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in computer test anxiety between the two groups. This is not to infer that there was no computer test anxiety expressed but rather that there was virtually no difference in the level of anxiety reported by the experimental group and the control group.    Further analysis of data indicated that persons with previous computer experience reported higher levels of computer test anxiety than those without previous computer experience and that females reported themselves as experiencing higher levels of computer test anxiety than did males. The results did not indicate that minorities experienced higher levels of computer test anxiety than non-minority groups. Lastly, there was no correlation between nursing grade point average or age and levels of computer test anxiety.    Conclusion. Participation in a computerized testing simulation did not affect the level of computer test anxiety. The only groups to experience higher levels of computer test anxiety are females and those with previous computer experience.

T1  - Test Anxiety and Test Performance Under Computerized Adaptive Testing Methods
AN  - 62934912; ED344910
AB  - Little research exists on the psychological impacts of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and how it may affect test performance. Three CAT procedures were examined, in which items were selected to match students' achievement levels, from the item pool at random, or according to student choice of item difficulty levels. Twenty-four graduate students (5 males and 19 females) at Indiana University (Richmond) were randomly assigned to one of six testing orders formed by the three mastery test approaches and by blocking on native and non-native speakers. While at a computer, students received a description of adaptive testing methods and then a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. Right after completing each test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale, ranked their preferences among tests, and evaluated their performance on each of the tests. No statistically significant mean differences were found among mean student achievement scores or among in-test anxiety means under the three adaptive testing methods. Students reporting higher anxiety scored significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Those preferring the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most were less anxious during those tests. Instead of actual performance, students' perceptions of how well they did were significantly correlated with preference rankings for the tests. The matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach decisions than did the random-selection tests. Ten tables, 1 figure, and a 19-item list of references are included.

T1  - The effect of adaptive testing item selection methods on the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation
AN  - 304000167
AB  - Item selection is very important in the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) since each item is critical in determining the precision of ability estimation and the examinee's motivation in taking the test. The precision of ability estimation can be enhanced by maximizing item information, and the examinee's motivation is most influenced by the item difficulty.    The matching $m\sb{j}$ to $\\theta$ item selection (Matching) method selects easier items but does not maximize information. The maximum information item selection (Maxinfo) method sometimes selects items which are too difficult for the examinees. The purpose of the study is to explore the maximum information of an adjusted $\\theta$ item selection (Adjusted) method which is designed to combine the above two methods to select easier items but yet to maximize information. These item selection methods are different in terms of the difficulty and information of the items selected. They were compared in the modified microcomputerized adaptive placement test in mathematics (MAPTM-1) system which employs the EAP (Expected A Posteriori) scoring method. One hundred and thirty-five paid subjects were stratified into the low, medium, and high math levels. Within each math level, subjects were randomly assigned to be tested using one of the three methods. A further simulation study of the methods was based on data generated from the real data.    Matching did not perform as well as the other two methods. Adjusted tended to select higher discriminating and easier items than Maxinfo in medium and high math levels; in simulation, the differences in the characteristics of items selected between Adjusted and Maxinfo vanished. Maxinfo and Adjusted were about the same in terms of information and posterior standard deviation of the ability estimate; they were more precise than Matching. It is very promising that Adjusted can replace Maxinfo. There was no significant difference among the methods in the analyses of the examinees' motivation levels. However, the difficulty of the test may still have had an effect on the examinees' motivation if the test was administered to examinees who were required to take it for placement purpose.

T1  - Individual Differences in Computer Adaptive Testing: Anxiety, Computer Literacy and Satisfaction
AN  - 62563471; ED400285
AB  - The relationship of several individual differences variables to Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) as compared with traditional written tests are explored. Seven hundred sixty-five examinees took a Computer Adaptive Test and two fixed-length written tests. Each examinee also answered a computer literacy inventory, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a test anxiety survey. Test anxiety was found to be a significant factor in performance on both of the written tests, but not on the CAT test. Anxiety was also found to be a significant factor on several of the items on the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall, significant factors that predict satisfaction with CAT testing included level of test anxiety, computer literacy, and test length (the CAT test varied in terms of the number of items administered). Results are discussed in terms of the political and practical implications of administering CAT tests as compared to administering traditional written tests. The results also indicate that some of the individual differences variables that have been found to affect performance on written tests are not significant in CAT.

T1  - Test anxiety and test performance under computerized adaptive testing methods
AN  - 303923651
AB  - Research on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has shown its potential to estimate student achievement accurately and efficiently. However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of CAT and how it may, consequently, affect test performance. Three kinds of computerized adaptive testing procedures were examined, in which items were selected in one of three ways: (a) to match students' estimated achievement levels (matched-selection), (b) from the item pool at random (random-selection), and (c) according to student choice of item difficulty levels (self-selection).    Twenty-four graduate students were randomly assigned to one of six possible testing orders formed by the three adaptive tests while blocking on native and nonnative speakers. While at a computer, students first received a description of adaptive testing methods, followed by a 20-item pre-test anxiety measure. The three adaptive tests were then given in the assigned random order. Immediately after each adaptive test, students responded to a 10-item in-test anxiety scale. Finally, they ranked their preferences and evaluated their performance on each of the three tests. Written student comments and questions regarding the adaptive testing methods were also solicited.    No statistically significant differences were found among mean student achievement scores, nor among in-test anxiety means, under the three adaptive testing methods. Students who reported higher pre-test anxiety were found to score significantly higher in the matched-selection test. Students who preferred the matched-selection and self-selection tests the most tended to be significantly less anxious during those tests. However, instead of students' actual test performance, it was their perception of how well they did that was significantly correlated with their preference rankings for the three tests. Though not central to this study, the matched-selection tests required significantly fewer items to reach mastery decisions than did the random-selection tests.
