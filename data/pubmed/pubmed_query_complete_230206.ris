      Young Adults with Cerebral Palsy? The Mediating and Moderating Roles of 
      Contextual Factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore whether self-determination and family's socioeconomic 
      status (SES) mediate and/or moderate the relationship between mobility and 
      community participation of adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy (CP). 
      DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Online platform. PARTICIPANTS: From 55 eligible 
      adolescents/young adults with CP, 50 agreed to participate and two were excluded. 
      The final convenience sample included 48 individuals, aged 15 to 32, levels I-IV 
      of the Gross Motor Function Classification System and I-II of the Communication 
      Function Classification System. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The Temple University 
      Community Participation Measure (TUCPM) documented the amount, breadth and 
      insufficiency/sufficiency ratios of participation across 26 community settings. 
      The ARC Self-Determination Scale and the Mobility Scale of the Pediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) measured 
      individuals' self-determination (i.e., autonomy, psychological empowerment and 
      self-realization) and mobility skills, respectively. The Brazilian Economic 
      Classification Criteria-2021 assessed families' SES. RESULTS: Analyses of 
      mediating/moderating effects revealed that the influence of individuals' mobility 
      skills on their breadth of community participation was mediated by autonomy. 
      Families' SES moderated the indirect effect of mobility on community 
      participation breadth through autonomy. When the model was adjusted for 
      participants' age, individuals with higher SES reported greater breadth in 
      community participation, compared to those from moderate and lower SES, for all 
      mobility levels. However, the magnitude of the differences among individuals of 
      different SES levels diminished as mobility increased. CONCLUSIONS: The mobility 
      skills of youths with CP influence their community participation through 
      autonomy. To foster greater engagement of these individuals in the community, 
      rehabilitation professionals should focus not only on improvement of mobility 
      skills, but also on the promotion of self-determined behaviors, especially 
      autonomy.

TI  - Did the Physical and Mental Health of Orthopaedic Patients Change After the Onset 
      of the COVID-19 Pandemic?
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002555 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated 
      with poor mental health outcomes and widened health disparities in the United 
      States. Given the inter-relationship between psychosocial factors and functional 
      outcomes in orthopaedic surgery, it is important that we understand whether 
      patients presenting for musculoskeletal care during the pandemic were associated 
      with worse physical and mental health than before the pandemic's onset. 
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Did patients seen for an initial visit by an orthopaedic 
      provider during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate worse physical function, pain 
      interference, depression, and/or anxiety than patients seen before the pandemic, 
      as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) instrument? (2) During the COVID-19 pandemic, did patients living in 
      areas with high levels of social deprivation demonstrate worse patterns of 
      physical function, pain interference, depression, or anxiety on initial 
      presentation to an orthopaedic provider than patients living in areas with low 
      levels of social deprivation, compared with prepandemic PROMIS scores? METHODS: 
      This was a retrospective, comparative study of new patient evaluations that 
      occurred in the orthopaedic department at a large, urban tertiary care academic 
      medical center. During the study period, PROMIS computer adaptive tests were 
      routinely administered to patients at clinical visits. Between January 1, 2019, 
      and December 31, 2019, we identified 26,989 new patients; we excluded 4% (1038 of 
      26,989) for being duplicates, 4% (1034 of 26,989) for having incomplete 
      demographic data, 44% (11,925 of 26,989) for not having a nine-digit home ZIP 
      Code recorded, and 5% (1332 of 26,989) for not completing all four PROMIS 
      computer adaptive tests of interest. This left us with 11,660 patients in the 
      "before COVID-19" cohort. Between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, we 
      identified 30,414 new patients; we excluded 5% (1554 of 30,414) for being 
      duplicates, 4% (1142 of 30,414) for having incomplete demographic data, 41% 
      (12,347 of 30,414) for not having a nine-digit home ZIP Code recorded, and 7% 
      (2219 of 30,414) for not completing all four PROMIS computer adaptive tests of 
      interest. This left us with 13,152 patients in the "during COVID-19" cohort. 
      Nine-digit home ZIP Codes were used to determine patients' Area Deprivation 
      Indexes, a neighborhood-level composite measure of social deprivation. To ensure 
      that patients included in the study represented our overall patient population, 
      we performed univariate analyses on available demographic and PROMIS data between 
      patients included in the study and those excluded from the study, which revealed 
      no differences (results not shown). In the before COVID-19 cohort, the mean age 
      was 57 +/- 16 years, 60% (7046 of 11,660) were women, 86% (10,079 of 11,660) were 
      White non-Hispanic, and the mean national Area Deprivation Index percentile was 
      47 +/- 25. In the during COVID-19 cohort, the mean age was 57 +/- 16 years, 61% (8051 
      of 13,152) were women, 86% (11,333 of 13,152) were White non-Hispanic, and the 
      mean national Area Deprivation Index percentile was 46 +/- 25. The main outcome 
      measures in this study were the PROMIS Physical Function ([PF], version 2.0), 
      Pain Interference ([PI], version 1.1), Depression (version 1.0), and Anxiety 
      (version 1.0). PROMIS scores follow a normal distribution with a mean t-score of 
      50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher PROMIS PF scores indicate better 
      self-reported physical capability, whereas higher PROMIS PI, Depression, and 
      Anxiety scores indicate more difficulty managing pain, depression, and anxiety 
      symptoms, respectively. Clinically meaningful differences in PROMIS scores 
      between the cohorts were based on a minimum clinically important difference 
      (MCID) threshold of 4 points. Multivariable linear regression models were created 
      to determine whether presentation to an orthopaedic provider during the pandemic 
      was associated with worse PROMIS scores than for patients who presented before 
      the pandemic. Regression coefficients (ss) represent the estimated difference in 
      PROMIS scores that would be expected for patients who presented during the 
      pandemic compared with patients who presented before the pandemic, after 
      adjusting for confounding variables. Regression coefficients were evaluated in 
      the context of clinical importance and statistical significance. Regression 
      coefficients equal to or greater than the MCID of 4 points were considered 
      clinically important, whereas p values < 0.05 were considered statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: We found no clinically important differences in baseline 
      physical and mental health PROMIS scores between new patients who presented to an 
      orthopaedic provider before the COVID-19 pandemic and those who presented during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic (PROMIS PF: ss -0.2 [95% confidence interval -0.43 to 0.03]; 
      p = 0.09; PROMIS PI: ss 0.06 [95% CI -0.13 to 0.25]; p = 0.57; PROMIS Depression: 
      ss 0.09 [95% CI -0.14 to 0.33]; p = 0.44; PROMIS Anxiety: ss 0.58 [95% CI 0.33 to 
      0.84]; p < 0.001). Although patients from areas with high levels of social 
      deprivation had worse PROMIS scores than patients from areas with low levels of 
      social deprivation, patients from areas with high levels of social deprivation 
      demonstrated no clinically important differences in PROMIS scores when groups 
      before and during the pandemic were compared (PROMIS PF: ss -0.23 [95% CI -0.80 to 
      0.33]; p = 0.42; PROMIS PI: ss 0.18 [95% CI -0.31 to 0.67]; p = 0.47; PROMIS 
      Depression: ss 0.42 [95% CI -0.26 to 1.09]; p = 0.23; PROMIS Anxiety: ss 0.84 [95% 
      CI 0.16 to 1.52]; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Contrary to studies describing worse 
      physical and mental health since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found no 
      changes in the health status of orthopaedic patients on initial presentation to 
      their provider. Although large-scale action to mitigate the effects of worsening 
      physical or mental health of orthopaedic patients may not be needed at this time, 
      orthopaedic providers should remain aware of the psychosocial needs of their 
      patients and advocate on behalf of those who may benefit from intervention. Our 
      study is limited in part to patients who had the self-agency to access specialty 
      orthopaedic care, and therefore may underestimate the true changes in the 
      physical or mental health status of all patients with musculoskeletal conditions. 
      Future longitudinal studies evaluating the impact of specific COVID-19-related 
      factors (for example, delays in medical care, social isolation, or financial 
      loss) on orthopaedic outcomes may be helpful to prepare for future pandemics or 
      natural disasters. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

TI  - Protocol for validation of the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) for 
      children under 3 years of age in seven countries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Children's early development is affected by caregiving experiences, 
      with lifelong health and well-being implications. Governments and civil societies 
      need population-based measures to monitor children's early development and ensure 
      that children receive the care needed to thrive. To this end, the WHO developed 
      the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) to measure children's early 
      development up to 3 years of age. The GSED includes three measures for population 
      and programmatic level measurement: (1) short form (SF) (caregiver report), (2) 
      long form (LF) (direct administration) and (3) psychosocial form (PF) (caregiver 
      report). The primary aim of this protocol is to validate the GSED SF and LF. 
      Secondary aims are to create preliminary reference scores for the GSED SF and LF, 
      validate an adaptive testing algorithm and assess the feasibility and preliminary 
      validity of the GSED PF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct the validation in 
      seven countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cote d'Ivoire, Pakistan, The Netherlands, 
      People's Republic of China, United Republic of Tanzania), varying in geography, 
      language, culture and income through a 1-year prospective design, combining 
      cross-sectional and longitudinal methods with 1248 children per site, stratified 
      by age and sex. The GSED generates an innovative common metric (Developmental 
      Score: D-score) using the Rasch model and a Development for Age Z-score (DAZ). We 
      will evaluate six psychometric properties of the GSED SF and LF: concurrent 
      validity, predictive validity at 6 months, convergent and discriminant validity, 
      and test-retest and inter-rater reliability. We will evaluate measurement 
      invariance by comparing differential item functioning and differential test 
      functioning across sites. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received 
      ethical approval from the WHO (protocol GSED validation 004583 20.04.2020) and 
      approval in each site. Study results will be disseminated through webinars and 
      publications from WHO, international organisations, academic journals and 
      conference proceedings. REGISTRATION DETAILS: Open Science Framework

TI  - Evaluation of Preoperative Factors Affecting Midterm Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Following Ligament Reconstruction Tendon Interposition: A Prognostic Study.

LID - 10.1016/j.jhsa.2022.11.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of 
      preoperative patient-reported outcomes as predictors of functional improvement 
      following ligament reconstruction tendon interposition. We hypothesized that high 
      levels of preoperative pain interference (PI) and upper-extremity disability are 
      associated with lower magnitudes of functional improvement >/=1 year after surgery 
      on the shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand 
      (QuickDASH) (primary outcome) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System Upper Extremity (UE) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) (UE CAT) 
      v1.2 (secondary outcome). METHODS: Adult patients who underwent ligament 
      reconstruction tendon interposition between February 2014 and April 2018 at an 
      academic tertiary institution were considered for inclusion in this longitudinal 
      cohort study. Patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and >/=1 year 
      after surgery. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were 
      performed to identify factors associated with the magnitude of functional 
      improvement on the QuickDASH and UE CAT. RESULTS: Among 93 included participants, 
      the mean age was 61 +/- 7 years, and 75 (81%) were women. At 2.5 +/- 1.0 years after 
      surgery, the QuickDASH and UE CAT improved by a mean of 24.5 +/- 20.9 and 9.9 +/- 
      10.7 points, respectively. In the primary multivariable model, a greater 
      preoperative QuickDASH (indicative of lower function; coefficient, 0.8; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 0.9) and lower preoperative Performance of 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PI CAT (eg, less pain 
      interference; coefficient, -0.7; 95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2) were associated with 
      greater QuickDASH improvement independent of potential confounders. In the 
      secondary multivariable model, lower preoperative UE CAT (indicative of worse 
      function; coefficient, -0.9; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.7) and lower preoperative 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PI CAT 
      (coefficient, -0.3; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1) were associated with greater UE CAT 
      improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative patient-reported outcomes may be useful in 
      understanding the degree of improvement that certain patient populations can 
      expect from ligament reconstruction tendon interposition. Those with lower 
      baseline (preoperative) upper-extremity function and PI are expected to derive 
      the greatest functional improvement in the midterm. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe Musical Emotion Discrimination Task (MEDT) is a short, non-adaptive 
      test of the ability to discriminate emotions in music. Test-takers hear two 
      performances of the same melody, both played by the same performer but each 
      trying to communicate a different basic emotion, and are asked to determine which 
      one is "happier", for example. The goal of the current study was to construct a 
      new version of the MEDT using a larger set of shorter, more diverse music clips 
      and an adaptive framework to expand the ability range for which the test can 
      deliver measurements. The first study analysed responses from a large sample of 
      participants (N = 624) to determine how musical features contributed to item 
      difficulty, which resulted in a quantitative model of musical emotion 
      discrimination ability rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT). This model informed 
      the construction of the adaptive MEDT. A second study contributed preliminary 
      evidence for the validity and reliability of the adaptive MEDT, and demonstrated 
      that the new version of the test is suitable for a wider range of abilities. This 
      paper therefore presents the first adaptive musical emotion discrimination test, 
      a new resource for investigating emotion processing which is freely available for 
      research use.

LID - 105711
AB  - Speech comprehension counts as a benchmark outcome of cochlear implants 
      (CIs)-disregarding the communicative importance of efficient integration of 
      audiovisual (AV) socio-emotional information. We investigated effects of 
      time-synchronized facial information on vocal emotion recognition (VER). In 
      Experiment 1, 26 CI users and normal-hearing (NH) individuals classified emotions 
      for auditory-only, AV congruent, or AV incongruent utterances. In Experiment 2, 
      we compared crossmodal effects between groups with adaptive testing, calibrating 
      auditory difficulty via voice morphs from emotional caricatures to 
      anti-caricatures. CI users performed lower than NH individuals, and VER was 
      correlated with life quality. Importantly, they showed larger benefits to VER 
      with congruent facial emotional information even at equal auditory-only 
      performance levels, suggesting that their larger crossmodal benefits result from 
      deafness-related compensation rather than degraded acoustic representations. 
      Crucially, vocal caricatures enhanced CI users' VER. Findings advocate AV stimuli 
      during CI rehabilitation and suggest perspectives of caricaturing for both 
      perceptual trainings and sound processor technology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to calculate the minimal clinically 
      important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and patient 
      acceptable symptom state (PASS) of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Computer Adaptive Testing v2.0 (UE), 
      Pain Interference (P-Interference), and Pain Intensity (P-Intensity) in patients 
      treated nonoperatively for idiopathic adhesive capsulitis (IAC). METHODS: The 
      anchor-based MCID, SCB, and PASS were calculated as the change in PROMIS scores 
      representing the optimal cutoff for a ROC curve with an area under the curve 
      (AUC) analysis. The distribution-based MCID was calculated as a range between the 
      average standard error of measurement multiplied by two different constants: 1 
      and 2.77. Effect sizes and standardized response means (SRM) were calculated to 
      assess the responsiveness of each PROMIS instrument while regression analyses 
      were performed to identify factors associated with achieving these thresholds. 
      RESULTS: This study enrolled 115 patients. The anchor-based MCID for PROMIS UE, 
      P-Interference, and P-Intensity was 5.11, 4.16, and 8.16, respectively. The 
      respective SCB was 8.44, 6.65, and 10.05. The respective PASS was 8.47, 7.01, and 
      10.41. The odds of achieving MCID values in adhesive capsulitis were negatively 
      affected by gender (male), higher forward elevation at the time of presentation, 
      higher pain scores (P-Interference), need for >/= 2 corticosteroid injections, and 
      a concomitant diagnosis of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The MCID, SCB, and PASS 
      parameters for PROMIS scores can be utilized to determine the clinical 
      meaningfulness of patient-reported improvements in these instruments during the 
      nonoperative treatment and as a research tool to compare the efficacy of new 
      treatments for adhesive capsulitis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, basic science 
      study, validation of outcome instruments. Key points * This is the first study to 
      calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial 
      clinical benefit (SCB), and patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) for the 
      Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity 
      and Pain instruments in patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis (IAC) of the 
      shoulder.* This study determined the impact of symptom severity, demographics, 
      and comorbidities on achieving the MCID, SCB, and PASS for PROMIS instruments in 
      IAC patients treated nonoperatively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be useful for patients 
      with benign liver tumours and cysts (BLTC) to evaluate the impact of treatment 
      and/or guide shared decision making. Yet, a set of PROMs relevant to patients 
      with BLTC is currently unavailable. In this study, we selected a PROMs set for 
      patients with BLTC. METHODS: Potentially relevant patient reported outcomes 
      (PROs) were selected by psychologist-researchers based on keywords used or 
      suggested by participants of two virtual focus groups meetings consisting of 
      thirteen female BLTC patients with a median age of 50 years. Subsequently, 
      patients were asked to report their most relevant PROs. PROMs identified by 
      systematic literature review and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) were considered 
      in selecting the final PROMs set to assess relevant outcomes. RESULTS: The most 
      important PROs were: insecurity/anxiety (11/12 patients), pain (9/12 patients), 
      fatigue (8/12 patients), and limitations in daily life (5/12 patients). The 
      literature review included 23 studies, which used various generic and 
      disease-specific PROMs, often not measuring (all) relevant PROs. The final 
      selected PROMs set included numerical rating scales for pain, two questions on 
      overall health and quality of life and four PROMIS CATs. CONCLUSIONS: A PROMs set 
      generically and efficiently measuring outcomes relevant for patients with BLTC 
      was developed and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

TI  - There is Little or No Association Between Independently Assessed Communication 
      Strategies and Patient Ratings of Clinician Empathy.
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002482 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of care is increasingly assessed and incentivized using 
      measures of patient-reported outcomes and experience. Little is known about the 
      association between measurement of clinician communication strategies by trained 
      observers and patient-rated clinician empathy (a patient-reported experience 
      measure). An effective independent measure could help identify and promote 
      clinician behaviors associated with good patient experience of care. 
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the association between independently assessed 
      clinician communication effectiveness and patient-rated clinician empathy? (2) 
      Which factors are associated with independently assessed communication 
      effectiveness? METHODS: One hundred twenty adult (age > 17 years) new or 
      returning patients seeking musculoskeletal specialty care between September 2019 
      and January 2020 consented to video recording of their visit followed by 
      completion of questionnaires rating their perceptions of providers' empathy 
      levels in this prospective study. Patients who had operative treatment and those 
      who had nonoperative treatment were included in our sample. We pooled new and 
      returning patients because our prior studies of patient experience found no 
      influence of visit type and because we were interested in the potential 
      influences of familiarity with the clinician on empathy ratings. We did not 
      record the number of patients or baseline data of patients who were approached, 
      but most patients (> 80%) were willing to participate. For 7% (eight of 120 
      patients), there was a malfunction with the video equipment or files were 
      misplaced, leaving 112 records available for analysis. Patients were seen by one 
      provider among four attending physicians, four residents, or four physician 
      assistants or nurse practitioners. The primary study question addressed the 
      correlation between patient-rated clinician empathy using the Jefferson Scale of 
      Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy and clinician communication 
      effectiveness, independently rated by two communication scholars using the 
      Liverpool Communication Skills Assessment Scale. Based on a subset of 68 videos 
      (61%), the interrater reliability was considered good for individual items on the 
      Liverpool Communication Skills Assessment Scale (intraclass correlation 
      coefficient [ICC] 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.81]) and excellent 
      for the sum of the items (that is, the total score) (ICC = 0.92 [95% CI 0.87 to 
      0.95]). To account for the potential association of personal factors with empathy 
      ratings, patients completed measures of symptoms of depression (the 
      Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System depression computerized 
      adaptive test), self-efficacy in response to pain (the two-item Pain 
      Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), health anxiety (the five-item Short Health Anxiety 
      Inventory), and basic demographics. RESULTS: Accounting for potentially 
      confounding variables, including specific clinicians, marital status, and work 
      status in the multivariable analysis, we found higher independent ratings of 
      communication effectiveness had a slight association (odds ratio [OR] 1.1 [95% CI 
      1.0 to 1.3]; p = 0.02) with higher (dichotomized) ratings of patient-rated 
      clinician empathy, while being single was associated with lower ratings (OR 0.40 
      [95% CI 0.16 to 0.99]; p = 0.05). Independent ratings of communication 
      effectiveness were slightly higher for women (regression coefficient 1.1 [95% CI 
      0.05 to 2.2]); in addition, two of the four attending physicians were rated 
      notably higher than the other 10 participants after controlling for confounding 
      variables (differences up to 5.8 points on average [95% CI 2.6 to 8.9] on a 
      36-point scale). CONCLUSION: The observation that ratings of communication 
      effectiveness by trained communication scholars have little or no association 
      with patient-rated clinician empathy suggests that either effective communication 
      is insufficient for good patient experience or that the existing measures are 
      inadequate or inappropriate. This line of investigation might be enhanced by 
      efforts to identify clinician behaviors associated with better patient 
      experience, develop reliable and effective measures of clinician behaviors and 
      patient experience, and use those measures to develop training approaches that 
      improve patient experience. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, prognostic study.

TI  - Determinants of higher education teachers' intention to use technology-based 
      exams.
PG  - 1-29
LID - 10.1007/s10639-022-11435-4 [doi]
AB  - The replacement of existing technology or the introduction of novel technology 
      into the day-to-day routines of higher education institutions is not a trivial 
      task. Currently, many higher education institutions are faced with the challenge 
      of replacing existing procedures for administering written exams with e-exams. To 
      guide this process, this paper proposes the novel technology-based exams 
      acceptance model (TEAM) and empirically evaluates its model structure and 
      usefulness from the perspective of higher education teachers. The model can be 
      used to guide the transition from paper-based exams to e-exams and the 
      implementation of innovative (e.g., adaptive) e-exam formats. The model includes 
      perceived usefulness, computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, prior experience, 
      facilitating conditions, and subjective norm as predictors of the behavioral 
      intention to use e-exams. To test the model empirically, the responses of 992 
      teachers at 63 German universities to a standardized online questionnaire were 
      analyzed using structural equation modeling. The model fit was acceptable. With 
      77% (conventional e-exams) and 82% (adaptive e-exams), a large proportion of the 
      variance of the intention to use these types of exams was explained. With TEAM, a 
      highly predictive model for explaining the behavioral intention to use e-exams is 
      now available. It offers a theoretical basis that can be used for the successful 
      implementation of e-exams in higher education.

TI  - Psychometric Performance of a Condition-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument for 
      Dutch Children Born with Esophageal Atresia.
LID - 10.3390/children9101508 [doi]
LID - 1508
AB  - A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL(c)) to assess quality of life of children 
      born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before 
      implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance 
      in Dutch children. After Swedish-Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was 
      conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, 
      reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive 
      debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not 
      generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old 
      children, 8/17 items had &gt;5% missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, 
      this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. 
      The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good 
      correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports 
      was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity 
      was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 
      8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the 
      Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. 
      Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual 
      child's situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to 
      customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, 
      cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in 
      different countries are needed.

TI  - Two efficient selection methods for high-dimensional CD-CAT utilizing 
      max-marginals factor from MAP query and ensemble learning approach.
LID - 10.1111/bmsp.12288 [doi]
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing for cognitive diagnosis (CD-CAT) needs to be 
      efficient and responsive in real time to meet practical applications' 
      requirements. For high-dimensional data, the number of categories to be 
      recognized in a test grows exponentially as the number of attributes increases, 
      which can easily cause system reaction time to be too long such that it adversely 
      affects the examinees and thus seriously impacts the measurement efficiency. More 
      importantly, the long-time CPU operations and memory usage of item selection in 
      CD-CAT due to intensive computation are impractical and cannot wholly meet 
      practice needs. This paper proposed two new efficient selection strategies (HIA 
      and CEL) for high-dimensional CD-CAT to address this issue by incorporating the 
      max-marginals from the maximum a posteriori query and integrating the ensemble 
      learning approach into the previous efficient selection methods, respectively. 
      The performance of the proposed selection method was compared with the 
      conventional selection method using simulated and real item pools. The results 
      showed that the proposed methods could significantly improve the measurement 
      efficiency with about 1/2-1/200 of the conventional methods' computation time 
      while retaining similar measurement accuracy. With increasing number of 
      attributes and size of the item pool, the computation time advantage of the 
      proposed methods becomes more significant.

TI  - Reducing the question burden of patient reported outcome measures using Bayesian 
      networks.

AB  - Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are questionnaires completed by 
      patients about aspects of their health status. They are a vital part of learning 
      health systems as they are the primary source of information about important 
      outcomes that are best assessed by patients such as pain, disability, anxiety and 
      depression. The volume of questions can easily become burdensome. Previous 
      techniques reduced this burden by dynamically selecting questions from question 
      item banks which are specifically built for different latent constructs being 
      measured. These techniques analyzed the information function between each 
      question in the item bank and the measured construct based on item response 
      theory then used this information function to dynamically select questions by 
      computerized adaptive testing. Here we extend those ideas by using Bayesian 
      Networks (BNs) to enable Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) for efficient and 
      accurate question selection on widely-used existing PROMs. BNs offer more 
      comprehensive probabilistic models of the connections between different PROM 
      questions, allowing the use of information theoretic techniques to select the 
      most informative questions. We tested our methods using five clinical PROM 
      datasets, demonstrating that answering a small subset of questions selected with 
      CAT has similar predictions and error to answering all questions in the PROM BN. 
      Our results show that answering 30% - 75% questions selected with CAT had an 
      average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 
      (min: 0.8 - max: 0.98) for predicting the measured constructs. BNs outperformed 
      alternative CAT approaches with a 5% (min: 0.01% - max: 9%) average increase in 
      the accuracy of predicting the responses to unanswered question items.

TI  - Impact of Occupational Therapy on Self-Care After Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy 
      Among Children With Cerebral Palsy.
LID - 7606205040 [pii]
LID - 10.5014/ajot.2022.049267 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is an established treatment for 
      spastic cerebral palsy (CP). The effects and predictors of occupational therapy's 
      benefit for self-care after SDR in children with CP have not been thoroughly 
      investigated. OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in self-care after occupational 
      therapy post-SDR and determine whether changes were affected by age, Gross Motor 
      Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, and number of occupational therapy 
      dressing sessions. DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected 
      outcomes pre-SDR, at discharge, and at 1-yr follow-up. Paired t tests and 
      regression analysis were performed. SETTING: Commission on Accreditation of 
      Rehabilitation Facilities-accredited pediatric inpatient rehabilitation facility. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three children (GMFCS Levels I-III, ages 4-17 yr) diagnosed 
      with spastic CP who underwent SDR from 2014 to 2018. INTERVENTION: After having 
      SDR, each child received an average of twice daily occupational therapy for an 
      average of 37.3 days. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Pediatric Evaluation of 
      Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) and Functional 
      Independence Measure for Children(R) (WeeFIM) were used to assess self-care 
      performance. RESULTS: The mean WeeFIM dressing (upper and lower body) and mean 
      PEDI-CAT daily activities scores from baseline to discharge and mean WeeFIM lower 
      body dressing at 1-yr follow-up improved significantly. The improvement in lower 
      body dressing correlated with GMFCS level and the number of occupational therapy 
      dressing sessions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The improvement in upper and lower 
      extremity dressing and PEDI-CAT daily activities scores suggests that inpatient 
      occupational therapy post-SDR may provide benefits. What This Article Adds: 
      Children diagnosed with CP may undergo surgical interventions to improve their 
      ability to walk. This article demonstrates the benefit of occupational therapy 
      services after SDR to improve upper and lower body dressing skills.

TI  - Exploring Retention, Usage, and Efficacy of Web-Based Delivery of Positive 
      Emotion Regulation Skills During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s42761-022-00135-4 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 prompted distress and increased reliance on digital mental health 
      interventions, which previously demonstrated low rates of retention and 
      adherence. This single-arm trial evaluated whether self-guided, web-based, 
      positive affect regulation skills (PARK) were engaging and associated with 
      changes in well-being during the pandemic. Over 6 weeks, PARK delivers brief 
      lessons and practices in skills designed to increase positive emotions: noticing 
      positive events, savoring, gratitude, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, personal 
      strengths, and self-compassion. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests of anxiety, depression, social isolation, 
      positive affect, and meaning and purpose were administered at baseline, 
      post-intervention, and 6 months after baseline. Retention and usage of PARK were 
      measured by the web-based assessment and intervention platforms. The sample (n = 
      616) was predominantly female, non-Hispanic, white, and well-educated. Of those 
      who completed baseline, only 42% completed a follow-up assessment; 30% never 
      logged into PARK. Among those who did, 86% used at least one skill, but only 14% 
      completed PARK. Across retention and usage metrics, older age predicted more 
      engagement. In multivariable models, people of color and people with greater 
      baseline anxiety were more likely to complete PARK. All well-being indicators 
      improved over time, with greater improvements in anxiety and social isolation 
      among participants who accessed at least one PARK skill compared to those who did 
      not. Retention and usage rates mirrored pre-pandemic trends, but within this 
      select sample, predictors of engagement differed from prior research. Findings 
      underscore the need for additional efforts to ensure equitable access to digital 
      mental health interventions and research. Trials registration: NCT04367922.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess: (1) the prevalence of mental health and substance use in 
      patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through use of a computer 
      adaptive test (CAT-MH), (2) the correlation among CAT-MH scores and self- and 
      clinician-reported assessments, and (3) the association between CAT-MH scores and 
      ED utilization in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment. METHODS: This was 
      a single-center observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED for 
      somatic complaints (97%) from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes were 
      computer-adaptive-assessed domains of suicidality, depression, anxiety, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We conducted Pearson 
      correlations and logistic regression for objectives 2 and 3, respectively. 
      RESULTS: From a sample of 794 patients, the proportion of those at 
      moderate/severe risk was: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% 
      (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). CAT-MH domains were highly 
      correlated with self-report assessments (r = 0.49-0.79). Individuals who had 2 or 
      more ED visits in the prior year had 62% increased odds of being in the 
      intermediate-high suicide risk category (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 1.07-2.44) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. 
      Individuals who scored in the intermediate-high-suicide risk group had 63% 
      greater odds of an ED visit within 30 days after enrollment compared to those who 
      scored as low risk (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.44). CONCLUSION: The CAT-MH 
      documented that a considerable proportion of ED patients presenting for somatic 
      problems had mental health conditions, even if mild. Mental health problems were 
      also associated with ED utilization.

AB  - A tablet-based language-independent self-test involving the recognition of 
      ecological sounds in background noise, the Sound Ear Check (SEC), was adapted to 
      make it feasible for young children. Two experiments were conducted. The first 
      experiment investigated the SEC's feasibility, as well as its sensitivity and 
      specificity for detecting childhood hearing loss with a monaural adaptive test 
      procedure. In the second experiment, the SEC sounds, noise, and test format were 
      adapted based on the findings of the first experiment. The adaptations were 
      combined with three test procedures, one similar to the one used in Experiment 1, 
      one presenting the sounds dichotically in diotic noise, and one presenting all 
      the sounds with a fixed signal-to-noise ratio and a stopping rule. Results in 
      young children show high sensitivity and specificity to detect different grades 
      of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (70-90%). When using an adaptive, 
      monaural procedure, the test duration was approximately 6 min, and 17% of the 
      results obtained were unreliable. Adaptive staircase analyses showed that the 
      unreliable results probably occur due to attention/motivation loss. The test 
      duration could be reduced to 3-4 min with adapted test formats without decreasing 
      the test-retest reliability. The unreliable test results could be reduced from 
      17% to as low as 5%. However, dichotic presentation requires longer training, 
      reducing the dichotic test format's feasibility.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate advanced psychometric properties of the 
      15-item Economic Strain and Resilience in Cancer (ENRICh) measure of financial 
      toxicity for cancer patients. METHODS: We surveyed 515 cancer patients in the 
      greater Houston metropolitan area using ENRICh from March 2019 to March 2020. We 
      conducted a series of factor analyses alongside parametric and non-parametric 
      item response theory (IRT) assessments using Mokken analysis and the graded 
      response model (GRM). We utilized parameters derived from the GRM to run a 
      simulated computerized adaptive test (CAT) assessment. RESULTS: Among 
      participants, mean age was 58.49 years and 278 (54%) were female. The initial 
      round factor analysis results suggested a one-factor scale structure. Negligible 
      levels of differential item functioning (DIF) were evident between eight items. 
      Three items were removed due to local interdependence (Q3>+0.4). The original 
      11-point numerical rating scale did not function well, and a new 3-point scoring 
      system was implemented. The final 12-item ENRICh had acceptable fit to the GRM 
      (p<0.001; TLI = 0.94; CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.09; RMSR = 0.06) as well as good 
      scalability and dimensionality. We observed high correlation between CAT version 
      scores and the 12-item measure (r = 0.98). During CAT, items 2 (money you owe) 
      and 4 (stress level about finances) were most frequently administered, followed 
      by items 1 (money in savings) and 5 (ability to pay bills). Scores from these 
      four items alone were strongly correlated with that of the 12-item ENRICh (r = 
      0.96). CONCLUSION: These CAT and 4-item versions provide options for quick 
      screening in clinical practice and low-burden assessment in research.

AB  - PURPOSE: Problems in speech recognition are often apparent in telecommunication 
      situations. For ecologically valid assessments of such conditions, it is 
      important to quantify the impact of real environments including acoustic 
      conditions at a far-end communication device and all paths of transmission 
      degradation. This study presents an automated matrix sentence test procedure 
      based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) integrated in a Voice over Internet 
      Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure and compares the individual effects of 
      transmission degradations with results from laboratory measurements. METHOD: 
      Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in 16 normal-hearing subjects 
      in four test conditions: (a) a laboratory condition guided by a human 
      experimenter, (b) a laboratory condition with reduced bandwidth and (c) 
      additionally reduced headset quality to simulate typical communication systems, 
      and (d) an automated, ASR-controlled adaptive test procedure over a real VoIP 
      infrastructure. Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects 
      on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant 
      correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and "laboratory" conditions, 
      with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without 
      affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the 
      different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study 
      provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP 
      systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it 
      produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 
      16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for 
      speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.

TI  - Time to Completion of Pediatric PROMIS Computerized Adaptive Testing Measures and 
      the SRS-22r in an Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Population.
PG  - 462-466
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0000000000002245 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures are useful tools to quantify 
      patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment symptoms. Historically used "legacy 
      measures", such as the Scoliosis Research Society-22 revised questionnaire 
      (SRS-22r), are often disease-specific and can be time-intensive. Recently 
      developed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT) measures may reduce administrative burdens 
      and permit more efficient outcome collection within clinic workflows. In an era 
      of medicine where payments are becoming tied to outcomes, we sought to assess the 
      time to completion (TTC) of 8 pediatric PROMIS CAT measures and the SRS-22r in 
      adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients presenting 
      to a large, urban tertiary referral hospital were prospectively enrolled into the 
      study. Subjects were first-time survey respondents in various phases and types of 
      treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. In total, 200 patients ranging 
      from 10 to 17 years old completed 8 Pediatric PROMIS CATs and the SRS-22r. PROMIS 
      CATs administered include Physical Activity, Mobility, Anxiety, Depressive 
      symptoms, Peer Relationships, Physical Stress Experiences, Pain Behavior and Pain 
      Interference. TTC was calculated using start and stop timestamps in the REDCap 
      software. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) TTC for each PROMIS CAT was 1.1 (+/-0.9) minutes 
      with physical activity, mobility, anxiety, depressive symptoms, peer 
      relationships, physical stress experiences, pain behavior, and pain interference 
      taking 1.2, 1.4, 1.0, 0.9, 1.2, 1.0, 1.0, and 1.2 minutes on average to complete, 
      respectively. Mean TTC for the SRS-22r was 5.2 (+/-3.0) minutes. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this pediatric orthopaedic cohort, completion of 8 PROMIS CATs demonstrated 
      minimal test-taker burden and time required for completion. These findings 
      support rapid and easily integrable PROMIS CATs in clinical practice to aid in 
      increased delivery of efficient, patient-centered care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, 
      cross-sectional study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional status of individuals with Osteogenesis 
      Imperfecta (OI) followed up at a reference center in the state of Bahia. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive 
      study, which evaluated individuals with OI, based on a non-probabilistic 
      sampling. To assess motor function, the Motor Function Measure (MFM) score was 
      used, in addition to the measurement of muscle strength using the Medical 
      Research Council (MRC) score. Functional performance was measured using the 
      Pediatric Assessment of Disability Inventory, Computerized Adaptive Testing 
      (PEDI-CAT). RESULTS: Thirty-one individuals aged between two and 18 years old 
      were evaluated. The overall score of MFM was 74.2%, and the lowest score was 
      found in participants with type III OI (56.3%). The median of the MRC index was 
      80. The mobility domain was the most affected in the PEDI-CAT evaluation, with a 
      mean T score of 23.9, (14.2 in type III OI). CONCLUSIONS: Among the evaluated 
      individuals, functional alterations were identified, reduced global gross motor 
      functionality and muscle strength, impacting the mobility domain, with the most 
      relevant findings in individuals with type III OI.

TI  - Validity and reliability of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS(R)) using Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) in patients with 
      advanced chronic kidney disease.
LID - gfac231 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfac231 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS(R)) has been recommended for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study compared the content, validity 
      and reliability of seven PROMIS CATs to the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey 
      (SF-12) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Adult 
      CKD patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min.1.73m2 not receiving dialysis treatment 
      completed seven PROMIS CATs (assessing physical function, pain interference, 
      fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and ability to participate in 
      social roles and activities), the SF-12 and, additionally, the PROMIS Pain 
      Intensity single item and Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI) at inclusion and 2-weeks. 
      A content comparison was performed between PROMIS CATs and SF-12. Construct 
      validity of PROMIS CATs was assessed using Pearson's correlations. Test-retest 
      reliability of all patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) was assessed by 
      calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable 
      change (MDC). RESULTS: In total, 207 patients participated in the study. A median 
      of 45 items (10 minutes) was completed for PROMIS CATs. All PROMIS CATs showed 
      evidence for sufficient construct validity. PROMIS CATs, most SF-12 domains and 
      summary scores, and DSI showed sufficient test-retest reliability (ICC >/= 0.70). 
      PROMIS CATs had a lower MDC compared to the SF-12 (5.7-7.4 compared to 11.2-21.7 
      across domains, respectively). CONCLUSION: PROMIS CATs showed sufficient 
      construct validity and test-retest reliability in patients with advanced CKD. 
      PROMIS CATs required more items but showed better reliability than the SF-12. 
      Future research is needed to investigate the feasibility of PROMIS CATs for 
      routine nephrology care.

TI  - PICU Survivorship: Factors Affecting Feasibility and Cohort Retention in a 
      Long-Term Outcomes Study.
LID - 10.3390/children9071041 [doi]
LID - 1041
AB  - Our understanding of longitudinal outcomes of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit 
      (PICU) survivors is limited by the heterogeneity of follow-up intervals, 
      populations, and outcomes assessed. We sought to demonstrate (1) the feasibility 
      of longitudinal multidimensional outcome assessment and (2) methods to promote 
      cohort retention. The objective of this presented study was to provide details of 
      follow-up methodology in a PICU survivor cohort and not to present the outcomes 
      at long-term follow-up for this cohort. We enrolled 152 children aged 0 to 17 
      years admitted to the PICU in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. We 
      examined resource utilization, family impact of critical illness, and 
      neurodevelopment using the PICU Outcomes Portfolio (POP) Survey which included a 
      study-specific survey and validated tools: 1. Functional Status Scale, 2. 
      Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, 3. Pediatric 
      Quality of Life Inventory, 4. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and 5. 
      Vanderbilt Assessment Scales for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder. POP 
      Survey completion rates were 89%, 78%, and 84% at 1, 3, and 6 months. Follow-up 
      rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 80%, 55%, and 43%. Implementing a longitudinal 
      multidimensional outcome portfolio for PICU survivors is feasible within an 
      urban, tertiary-care, academic hospital. Our attrition after one year 
      demonstrates the long-term follow-up challenges in this population. Our findings 
      inform ongoing efforts to implement core outcome sets after pediatric critical 
      illness.

      Properties and Validity.

AB  - Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially 
      competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed 
      in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion 
      knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric 
      practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still 
      a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a 
      performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of 
      Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3-9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven 
      components of emotion knowledge in 3-9-year-olds. The ATEM 3-9 is an adaptive 
      test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of 
      knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and 
      Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3-9 comprises N = 882 (54% female, 
      21% bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into 
      seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response 
      theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven 
      components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. 
      Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of 
      emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions 
      in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected 
      directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders 
      who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in 
      various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the 
      norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3-9 is well suited to measure individual 
      components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated 
      picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3-9 thus supports 
      the investigation of the development of social-emotional competencies in 
      normative development (e.g., school readiness) and in social-emotional-learning 
      interventions. Furthermore, it is suitable as an instrument for the 
      differentiated assessment of (progress of) children's emotion knowledge in 
      clinical child psychology and psychiatry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Detecting anxiety in oncology patients is important, requiring valid 
      yet brief measures. One increasingly popular approach is the Patient Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS); however, its validity is not 
      well established in oncology. We assessed the convergent and criterion validity 
      of PROMIS anxiety measures in an oncology sample. METHODS: 132 
      oncology/haematology outpatients completed the PROMIS Anxiety Computer Adaptive 
      Test (PROMIS-A-CAT) and the 7 item (original) PROMIS Anxiety Short Form 
      (PROMIS-A-SF) along with six well-established measures: Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A); Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); 
      Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Anxiety (DASS-A) and Stress (DASS-S); 
      Distress Thermometer (DT) and PSYCH-6. Correlations, area under the curve (AUC) 
      and diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with Structured Clinical 
      Interview as the reference standard. RESULTS: Both PROMIS measures correlated 
      with all legacy measures at p < .001 (Rho = .56-.83). AUCs (> .80) were good for 
      both PROMIS measures and comparable to or better than all legacy measures. At the 
      recommended mild cut-point (55), PROMIS-A-SF had sensitivity (.67) comparable to 
      or better than all the legacy measures, whereas PROMIS-A-CAT sensitivity (.59) 
      was lower than GAD-7 (.67) and HADS-A (.62), but comparable to PSYCH-6 and higher 
      than DASS-A, DASS-S and DT. Sensitivity for both was .79. A reduced cut-point of 
      51 on both PROMIS measures improved sensitivity (.83-.84) although specificity 
      was only adequate (.61-.62). CONCLUSIONS: The convergent and criterion validity 
      of the PROMIS anxiety measures in cancer populations was confirmed as equivalent, 
      but not superior to, established measures (GAD-7 and HADS-A). The PROMIS-A-CAT 
      did not demonstrate clear advantages over PROMIS-A-SF.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to interpret a quantitative diagnosis model 
      of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes based on computer adaptive 
      testing (CAT), from the perspective of both patients and clinicians. METHODS: In 
      this cross-sectional study, patients with postprandial distress syndrome 
      completed the CAT model of TCM syndromes and the Chinese version of the Quality 
      of Life Questionnaire for Functional Digestive Disorders (Chin-FDDQL); the 
      clinicians' diagnosis was concurrently recorded. The patients completed this 
      questionnaire again after 14 +/- 2 days. The kappa test and paired chi-square test 
      were used to evaluate the consistency between the CAT model and clinical 
      diagnosis. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of the Chin-FDDQL 
      scores were used to assess clinical efficacy from the patients' perspective. 
      Logistic regression was used to examine the association between changes in the 
      CAT model syndrome domain scores and changes in clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 
      Changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores may affect the clinical outcomes 
      of patients with the total scores of Chin-FDDQL (all P < 0.05). There was a 
      correlation between changes in the CAT model syndrome domain scores and the 
      patients' clinical outcomes. Different syndrome elements had different effects on 
      various Chin-FDDQL domains, which was consistent with the theory of TCM. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a method for the clinical interpretation of the 
      CAT model of TCM syndromes, including evidence derived from the application. It 
      may provide a reference for future interpretation of other CAT models.

AB  - To efficiently obtain information about both the general abilities and detailed 
      cognitive profiles of examinees from a single model that uses a 
      single-calibration process, higher-order cognitive diagnostic computerized 
      adaptive testing (CD-CAT) that employ higher-order cognitive diagnostic models 
      have been developed. However, the current item selection methods used in 
      higher-order CD-CAT adaptively select items according to only the attribute 
      profiles, which might lead to low precision regarding general abilities; hence, 
      an appropriate method was proposed for this CAT system in this study. Under the 
      framework of the higher-order models, the responses were affected by attribute 
      profiles, which were governed by general abilities. It is reasonable to hold that 
      the item responses were affected by a combination of general abilities and 
      attribute profiles. Based on the logic of Shannon entropy and the generalized 
      deterministic, inputs, noisy "and" gate (G-DINA) model discrimination index 
      (GDI), two new item selection methods were proposed for higher-order CD-CAT by 
      considering the above combination in this study. The simulation results 
      demonstrated that the new methods achieved more accurate estimations of both 
      general abilities and cognitive profiles than the existing methods and maintained 
      distinct advantages in terms of item pool usage.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine if preoperative expectations 
      (PE) are an independent predictor of greater 2-year outcomes and greater 
      improvement from baseline in shoulder surgery patients. METHODS: Two-hundred and 
      sixteen patients who underwent shoulder surgery at one institution were studied. 
      Patients completed both preoperative and 2-year follow-up questionnaires 
      including PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) 
      computer-adaptive testing in six domains, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      (ASES) score, shoulder numeric pain scale (NPS), and the Marx Shoulder Activity 
      Rating Scale (MARS). PE were measured using the Musculoskeletal Outcomes and Data 
      Evaluation Management System (MODEMS) expectations domain, and satisfaction was 
      measured via the Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8). RESULTS: The mean 
      PE score was 86.2 +/- 17.8. Greater PE were associated with significantly better 
      2-year scores for ASES, NPS, MARS, SSQ8, and PROMIS domains of Physical Function, 
      Fatigue, Pain Interference Fatigue and Social Satisfaction. Multivariable 
      analyses demonstrated that greater PE were an independent predictor of both 
      better 2-year scores and greater improvement for PROMIS SS (p < 0.001), ASES 
      (p = 0.007), and shoulder NPS (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Greater PE are positively 
      associated with numerous patient-based outcomes 2 years after surgery. With 
      regards to pain relief, shoulder function, and social satisfaction, higher PE are 
      also predictive of better outcome scores and more improvement. This study 
      suggests that preoperative assessment of shoulder surgery PE is important, and 
      that counseling patients to optimize realistic expectations may lead to superior 
      outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

TI  - Depression and Anxiety Screening Identifies Patients That may Benefit From 
      Treatment Regardless of Existing Diagnoses.
PG  - 215-219.e1

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the utility of depression and anxiety symptom 
      screening in patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty to examine 
      differences in active symptoms according to patients' mental health diagnoses and 
      associated prescription medications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      study analyzed 594 patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty at a tertiary 
      practice between June 2018 and December 2018. Patients completed Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurements Information System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety 
      Computerized Adaptive Tests in clinic quantifying active symptoms. Mental health 
      diagnoses and associated medications were extracted from health records. 
      Statistical analysis assessed between-group differences in mean PROMIS scores and 
      the prevalence of heightened depressive and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: 
      Multivariable linear regression modeling demonstrated that being diagnosed with 
      depression without medication (beta 7.1; P < .001) and with medication (beta 8.6; P < 
      .001) were each associated with higher PROMIS Depression scores. Similar modeling 
      demonstrated that patients diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed an anxiolytic (beta 
      8.4; P < .001) were associated with higher PROMIS Anxiety scores than undiagnosed 
      patients. Eighty-six (15%) patients experienced heightened anxiety and/or 
      depressive symptoms. Heightened depressive symptoms were more prevalent among 
      those diagnosed with depression (19% without medication, 24% with antidepressant 
      vs 5% undiagnosed: P < .001). Heightened anxiety symptoms were most prevalent 
      among those diagnosed with anxiety and on anxiolytic medication (25% vs 7% 
      diagnosed with anxiety without medication, 8% undiagnosed: P < .001). CONCLUSION: 
      One in seven arthroplasty patients screened reported heightened depressive and/or 
      anxiety symptoms. Despite the majority of arthroplasty patients on 
      antidepressants and anxiolytics having symptoms controlled, these patients remain 
      at increased risk of heightened active symptoms.

TI  - The Influence of Symptoms of Anger on Pain Intensity and Activity Intolerance.
LID - 10.1007/s10880-022-09894-5 [doi]
AB  - This study assessed the association of anger, anxiety, and depression, and 
      cognitive bias with pain and activity tolerance among patients with a 
      musculoskeletal illness or injury expected to last more than a month. 102 
      Patients completed emotional thermometers to quantify symptoms of anger, anxiety, 
      depression; the abbreviated Pain Catastrophizing Scale; a pain intensity scale; 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical 
      Function Computer Adaptive Test; the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
      and demographic questionnaires. Controlling for potential confounding in 
      multivariable analysis we found greater activity intolerance was associated with 
      retired work-status and greater depressive symptoms, but not with greater 
      symptoms of anger. In addition, greater pain intensity was associated with 
      greater symptoms of depression and greater catastrophic thinking, but not with 
      greater symptoms of anger. Anger emotions do not contribute to symptom intensity 
      and activity intolerance in musculoskeletal illness. Attention can be directed at 
      addressing psychological distress and cognitive bias.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The integration of a web-based computer-adaptive patient-reported 
      outcome test (CAT) platform with persuasive design optimised features including 
      recommendations for action into routine healthcare could provide a promising way 
      to translate reliable diagnostic results into action. This study aims to evaluate 
      the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such a platform for depression and 
      anxiety (RehaCAT+) compared with the standard diagnostic system (RehaCAT) in 
      cardiological and orthopaedic health clinics in routine care. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: A two-arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial will be 
      conducted. Twelve participating rehabilitation clinics in Germany will be 
      randomly assigned to a control (RehaCAT) or experimental group (RehaCAT+) in a 
      1:1 design. A total sample of 1848 participants will be recruited across all 
      clinics. The primary outcome, depression severity at 12 months follow-up (T3), 
      will be assessed using the CAT Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information 
      System Emotional Distress-Depression Item set. Secondary outcomes are depression 
      at discharge (T1) and 6 months follow-up (T2) as well as anxiety, satisfaction 
      with participation in social roles and activities, pain impairment, fatigue, 
      sleep, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, physical functioning, 
      alcohol, personality and health economic-specific general quality of life and 
      socioeconomic cost and benefits at T1-3. User behaviour, acceptance, facilitating 
      and hindering factors will be assessed with semistructured qualitative 
      interviews. Additionally, a smart sensing substudy will be conducted, with daily 
      ecological momentary assessments and passive collection of smartphone usage 
      variables. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle with 
      additional per-protocol analyses. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted 
      from a societal perspective and the perspective of the statutory pension 
      insurance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted according to the 
      Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee of Ulm University, has approved the 
      study (on 24 February 2021 ref. 509/20). Written informed consent will be 
      obtained for all participants. Results will be published via peer-reviewed 
      journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00027447.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcome measures, especially 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, has 
      increased in recent years. Given this growth, it is imperative to ensure that the 
      measures being used are validated for the intended population(s)/disease(s). Our 
      objective was to assess the construct validity of 8 PROMIS computer adaptive 
      testing (CAT) measures among children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). 
      METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 200 children (aged 10 to 17 y) with AIS, who 
      completed 8 PROMIS CATs (Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Mobility, Pain Behavior, 
      Pain Interference, Peer Relationships, Physical Activity, Physical Stress 
      Experiences) and the Scoliosis Research Society-22r questionnaire (SRS-22r) 
      electronically. Treatment categories were observation, bracing, indicated for 
      surgery, or postoperative from posterior spinal fusion. Construct validity was 
      evaluated using known group analysis and convergent and discriminant validity 
      analyses. Analysis of variance was used to identify differences in PROMIS T 
      -scores by treatment category (known groups). The Spearman rank correlation 
      coefficient ( rs ) was calculated between corresponding PROMIS and SRS-22r 
      domains (convergent) and between unrelated PROMIS domains (discriminant). 
      Floor/ceiling effects were calculated. RESULTS: Among treatment categories, 
      significant differences were found in PROMIS Mobility, Pain Behavior, Pain 
      Interference, and Physical Stress Experiences and in all SRS-22r domains ( P 
      <0.05) except Mental Health ( P =0.15). SRS-22r Pain was strongly correlated with 
      PROMIS Pain Interference ( rs =-0.72) and Pain Behavior ( rs =-0.71) and 
      moderately correlated with Physical Stress Experiences ( rs =-0.57). SRS-22r 
      Mental Health was strongly correlated with PROMIS Depressive Symptoms ( rs 
      =-0.72) and moderately correlated with Anxiety ( rs =-0.62). SRS-22r Function was 
      moderately correlated with PROMIS Mobility ( rs =0.64) and weakly correlated with 
      Physical Activity ( rs =0.34). SRS-22r Self-Image was weakly correlated with 
      PROMIS Peer Relationships ( rs =0.33). All unrelated PROMIS CATs were weakly 
      correlated (| rs |<0.40). PROMIS Anxiety, Mobility, Pain Behavior, and Pain 
      Interference and SRS-22r Function, Pain, and Satisfaction displayed ceiling 
      effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the construct validity of 6 PROMIS CATs 
      in evaluating AIS patients. Ceiling effects should be considered when using 
      specific PROMIS CATs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic.

AB  - Although many studies have been carried out on the psychometric aspects of 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT), its psychological aspects are less 
      researched. Early studies claimed that CAT can be more motivating and induce less 
      anxiety than traditional fixed-item tests (FIT). The purpose of this systematic 
      review and meta-analysis was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects 
      of CAT on motivation and anxiety in comparison to traditional fixed-item testing. 
      Seven databases were examined. Articles were eligible if they employed an 
      empirical study containing a direct comparison between CAT and FIT. 
      Meta-analytical results showed no overall effect of test type on anxiety and 
      motivation when comparing CAT with FIT (k = 11, g+ = 0.06, p = .28). However, 
      easier CAT had positive effect compared with FIT (k = 2, g+ = .22, p < .001). 
      Certain modifications in CAT administration can provide positive psychological 
      effects for test-takers.

AB  - Measurement-informed care is a cornerstone of evidence-based practice and shared 
      decision-making. A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a 
      globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the 
      public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the 
      diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of 
      psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which 
      might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most 
      prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive 
      testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating 
      scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity 
      of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom 
      rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is 
      normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment 
      in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient's perspective of the 
      presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement 
      to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of 
      executive function, emotional regulation, mind-wandering, and sluggish cognitive 
      tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated 
      deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients. Psychometrically validated tools 
      are available to complement every aspect of ADHD care and provide global 
      standards for research.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of glaucoma-specific quality of 
      life (QoL) item banks (GlauCAT) and assess their performance using computerized 
      adaptive testing (CAT) simulations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 293 
      participants with glaucoma (mean age +/- SD, 70.7 +/- 13.2 years; 45% female) 
      answered 342 items in 12 QoL item banks (IBs): Activity Limitation (AL); Driving 
      (DV); Convenience (CV); Economic (EC); Emotional (EM); General Symptoms (GS); 
      Health Concerns (HC); Lighting (LT); Mobility (MB); Ocular Surface Symptoms (OS); 
      Social (SC); and Visual Symptoms (VS). These IBs were assessed using Rasch 
      analysis, and CAT simulations with 1000 simulated respondents were utilized to 
      determine the average number of items to be administered to achieve moderate and 
      high precision levels. RESULTS: The AL, DV, EM, HC, LT, MB, EC, OS, SC, and VS 
      IBs required relatively minor amendments to achieve satisfactory psychometric 
      fit. To resolve multidimensionality, we split CV into Treatment Convenience (TCV) 
      and General Convenience (GCV). Due to poor measurement precision, the GS IB was 
      not pursued further. This resulted in 12 total IBs. In CAT simulations, an 
      average of 3.7 and 7.3 items per IB were required to attain measurement at 
      moderate and high precision, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Following rigorous 
      psychometric assessment, we developed 12 valid glaucoma-specific QoL domains that 
      can obtain highly precise person measure estimates using a small number of items. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: GlauCAT will enable researchers and clinicians to 
      quickly and comprehensively assess the impact of glaucoma and its associated 
      interventions across a range of QoL domains.

      Pain Management (NOHARM): Protocol for a Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized 
      Pragmatic Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1037-1053
LID - 10.1007/s40122-022-00393-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Opioids may be necessary for guideline-concordant acute 
      perioperative pain management, but their use carries risks for unintended 
      prolonged use and addiction. Guidelines recommend use of validated 
      non-pharmacological pain care (NPPC) approaches in conjunction with prescribed 
      opioids and other analgesics. Our protocol outlines a population-level, pragmatic 
      trial that will test a bundled intervention comprised of an electronic health 
      record (EHR) portal-based conversation guide, EHR clinical decision support 
      (CDS), and a suite of self-management educational and support materials to 
      encourage and advance NPPC use. METHODS: We are conducting a stepped-wedge, 
      cluster-randomized pragmatic trial spanning seven surgical specialties across six 
      geographically diverse locations within the Mayo Clinic Enterprise. Thirty two 
      surgical practices across six locations (Rochester, Minnesota; Mankato, 
      Minnesota; La Crosse, Wisconsin; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Phoenix, Arizona; 
      Jacksonville, Florida) comprise 22 distinct practice clusters that are randomly 
      assigned to one of five steps using constrained randomization. Steps "go live" by 
      initiating the intervention at 7-month intervals between March 2021 and July 
      2023. Patients over 18 years of age who are scheduled for qualifying procedures 
      within "live" consenting practices are sent a Healing After Surgery guide via 
      their patient portals pre-operatively, directing them to identify their preferred 
      NPPC modalities among 13 approaches. These selections create CDS options for care 
      teams to support patients with self-management materials that reinforce safe NPPC 
      use. PLANNED OUTCOMES: Patients' clinical, demographic, and outcome data will be 
      abstracted from the Epic EHR. Primary outcomes will be the Patient Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference and physical 
      functioning computer adaptive tests (CAT) collected at 1, 2, and 3 months 
      postoperatively via the patient portal. We will mail printed versions of the 
      6-item PROMIS short forms to portal non-responders to minimize bias. Secondary 
      outcomes will include the PROMIS anxiety CAT, opioid consumption, and 
      self-reported NPPC use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, 
      NCT04570371.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) have been suggested for use in 
      measuring treatment effectiveness. To minimize patient burden, two approaches 
      have been proposed: An orthopedic-specific Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation 
      (SANE) or computer adaptive testing methods such as the National Institutes of 
      Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). 
      The goal of this work was to examine the constructs measured by the SANE and 
      PROMIS system in a military orthopedic population undergoing knee surgery. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 732 patients and 2,166 complete observations, the 
      SANE-Knee PRO and PROMIS surveys for Depression, Anxiety, Pain Interference, 
      Sleep Disturbance, and Physical Function were obtained. A correlation matrix 
      between the PROs was calculated, the number of latent factors to extract was 
      determined via parallel plot, and the final principal axis exploratory factor 
      analysis was performed. RESULTS: The parallel plot analysis indicated that two 
      latent factors existed. One latent factor corresponded to measures of 
      psychological distress (PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, Depression, and Anxiety) and 
      the second latent factor corresponded to physical capability (SANE, PROMIS 
      Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Sleep Disturbance). Both PROMIS 
      Physical Function (0.83) and Pain Interference (-0.80) more strongly weigh on the 
      physical capability latent factor than SANE (0.69). CONCLUSIONS: In a knee 
      surgical population, the SANE, PROMIS Physical Function, and PROMIS Pain 
      Interference measure the same human dimension of physical capability; however, 
      PROMIS Physical Function and Pain Interference may measure this construct more 
      effectively in isolation. The SANE may be a more viable option to gauge physical 
      capability when computer adaptive testing is not possible.

AB  - The usefulness of depression scales for patients with cancer based on item 
      response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) has not yet been fully 
      explored. This study thus aimed to develop an IRT-based tool for measuring 
      depression in patients with cancer. We analyzed data from 393 patients with 
      cancer from four tertiary centers in Japan who had not received psychiatric 
      treatment. They answered 62 questions across five categories regarding their 
      psychiatric status over the previous week. We selected 28 items that satisfied 
      the assumptions of IRT, fitted a graded response model to these items, and 
      performed CAT simulations. The CAT simulation used an average of 6.96 items and 
      showed a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.916 (95% confidence interval, 
      0.899-0.931) between the degree of depression estimated by simulation and that 
      estimated using all 28 items. The measurement precision of CAT with only four 
      items was superior to that of the estimation using the calibrated Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9. These results imply that this scale is useful and accurate for 
      measuring depression in patients with cancer.

TI  - Measuring PROMIS(R) Physical Activity and Sleep Problems in Early Childhood.
PG  - 534-546
LID - 10.1093/jpepsy/jsac028 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) and sleep are leading health indicators for 
      individuals of all ages. Monitoring young children's PA and sleep using 
      psychometrically sound instruments could help facilitate timely interventions to 
      promote healthy development. This article describes the development of the 
      PROMIS(R) Early Childhood (EC) Parent Report Physical Activity (PA) and Sleep 
      Problems (SP) measures for children aged 1-5 years. METHODS: Item pools were 
      generated by interviewing parents, input from content experts, and literature 
      review. Data from a U.S. general population sample were used to determine factor 
      structures of item pools via factor analytic approaches, estimate item parameters 
      via item response theory (IRT) models, and establish norms. Pearson correlations 
      were used to evaluate across-domain associations. Analysis of variance was used 
      and known-groups' validity of PA and SP by comparing their scores to PROMIS EC 
      Parent Report Global Health: child's physical, emotional, and mental conditions. 
      RESULTS: Initial item pools consisted of 19 and 26 items for PA and SP, 
      respectively. Factor analyses' results supported unidimensionality of 5 and 16 
      items measuring PA and SP, respectively, which were then calibrated using IRT. 
      Norms were established by centering to a probability-based U.S. general 
      population. Computerized adaptive testing algorithms were established. Some 
      analyses supported initial measure validity. CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS EC PA 
      calibrated scale and SP item banks are user-friendly and brief, yet produce 
      precise scores. Both measures enable psychometrically sound assessment of PA 
      behavior and sleep problems. Future studies to comprehensively evaluate the 
      validity of these two measures are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Measure quality of life (QoL) outcomes using a novel computerised 
      adaptive test in a clinical setting, and determine the social and demographic 
      factors associated with specific QoL domains in patients with glaucoma. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study between July 2020 and April 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 
      English-speaking adults presenting to glaucoma clinic. Patients with cognitive 
      impairment on a six-item cognitive impairment screen or with intraocular surgery 
      within 90 days prior to presentation were excluded. RESULTS: Of 206 patients 
      surveyed, mean age was 64.8 years (SD 15.2), 122 (56.7%) were female and 159 
      (74.7%) were white. On multivariable regression, visual acuity was associated 
      with greater activity limitation (beta=-2.8 points, 95% CI -3.8 to -1.8, p<0.001) 
      and worse mobility (beta=-2.1 points, 95% CI -3.2 to -0.9, p<0.001), while poorer 
      visual field (VF) mean deviation was associated with lower scores on the 
      emotional well-being domain (beta=-2.4 points, 95% CI -4.6 to -0.3, p=0.03). 
      Glaucoma suspects and those with early VF defects had higher QoL scores than 
      those with severe glaucoma in the following domains: activity limitation 
      (88.5+/-14.6 vs 74.3+/-21.9, respectively, p<0.001), mobility (91.0+/-12.5 vs 
      80.0+/-25.3, respectively, p=0.005) and concerns domains (82.2+/-13.9 vs 72.5 5+/-18.9, 
      respectively, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a busy glaucoma clinic where QoL was 
      measured with online adaptive tests for glaucoma, we found that several 
      demographic and clinical variables are associated with lower domain scores, 
      suggesting that patients with predisposing demographic and clinical factors are 
      at a higher risk of worse QoL.

AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression and 
      anxiety symptoms in patients undergoing shoulder surgery using the National 
      Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety computer adaptive tests, and to determine 
      the factors associated with more severe symptoms. Additionally, we sought to 
      determine whether PROMIS Depression and Anxiety were associated with functional 
      outcomes after shoulder surgery. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 
      293 patients from an urban population who underwent elective shoulder surgery 
      from 2015 to 2018. Survey questionnaires included preoperative and two-year 
      postoperative data. Bivariate analysis was used to identify associations and 
      multivariable analysis was used to control for confounding variables. RESULTS: 
      Mean two-year PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores significantly improved from 
      preoperative scores, with a greater improvement observed in PROMIS Anxiety. Worse 
      PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores were also significantly correlated with 
      worse PROMIS Physical Function (PF) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      scores (ASES). After controlling for confounding variables, worse PROMIS 
      Depression was an independent predictor of worse PROMIS PF, while worse PROMIS 
      Anxiety was an independent predictor of worse PROMIS PF and ASES scores. 
      CONCLUSION: Mean two-year PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores improved after 
      elective shoulder surgery and several patient characteristics were associated 
      with these scores. Worse functional outcomes were associated with worse PROMIS 
      Depression and Anxiety; however, more severe two-year PROMIS Anxiety was the 
      strongest predictor of worse functional outcomes. Cite this article: Bone Joint

TI  - Development of empirically derived brief program evaluation measures in 
      Pennsylvania first-episode psychosis coordinated specialty care programs.
PG  - 96-106
LID - 10.1111/eip.13298 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The Pennsylvania first episode psychosis program evaluation (PA-FEP-PE) core 
      assessment battery was developed as a standard and comprehensive clinical 
      assessment and data collection tool in Pennsylvania coordinated specialty care 
      programs (CSC). To reduce administrative time and maximize clinical utility by 
      maintaining acceptable levels of precision, we aimed to generate a short form 
      using item response theory (IRT)-based computer-adaptive test (CAT) simulation 
      and analyse the implementation and acceptability of the short form among 
      providers from PA-CSC. METHODS: FEP participants (n = 759; age 14-36) from nine 
      coordinated specialty care programs completed 156 items drawn from the PA-FEP-PE 
      battery. Multidimensional IRT-based CAT simulations were used to select the best 
      PA-FEP-PE items for abbreviated forms. RESULTS: A 67-item PA-FEP-PE short form 
      was developed to capture six factors: (1) positive affect and surgency (with 
      negative loadings on Anxious-Misery items); (2) psychiatric services 
      satisfaction; (3) antipsychotic side effect severity; (4) family turmoil and 
      associated traumas; (5) trauma load; and (6) psychosis. The total number of items 
      was reduced more than 50% in the PA-FEP-PE shortened forms. The short form 
      demonstrated good psychometric properties, and it was well accepted by our 
      providers in the implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical derivation and 
      implementation of abbreviated measures of key domains and constructs in FEP care 
      have streamlined and facilitated PA-FEP program evaluation. Our work supports 
      potential application of IRT based methods to empirically reduce core assessment 
      battery measures in large-scale data collection efforts such as in the Early 
      Psychosis Intervention Network.

TI  - Discussion on "Adaptive enrichment designs with a continuous biomarker" by Nigel 
      Stallard.
LID - 10.1111/biom.13641 [doi]
AB  - We congratulate Dr. Nigel Stallard on his stimulating paper on adaptive 
      enrichment designs with a continuous biomarker. Dr. Stallard details a framework 
      for a large and interesting class of enrichment procedures. His work has 
      motivated us to offer some thoughts in response. Dr. Stallard's strategy is to 
      use the maximum of a test statistic over a set of possible threshold values to 
      define the enriched population to be sampled in a second stage. This reminds us 
      of procedures for identifying a change point, a biomarker value beyond which the 
      effect of treatment is increased. For simplicity we focus our comments on Dr. 
      Stallard's Rule 1 for selecting the second-stage sampling threshold. Using this 
      rule, we present the likelihood ratio approach for adaptive testing and compare 
      it to Dr. Stallard's approach for a few scenarios.

TI  - Rehabilitation after paediatric acquired brain injury: Longitudinal change in 
      content and effect on recovery.
PG  - 1168-1175
LID - 10.1111/dmcn.15199 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in 
      neurorehabilitation content provided to young people after severe paediatric 
      acquired brain injury (pABI) and to relate this to observed functional recovery. 
      METHOD: This was an observational study in a cohort of admissions to a 
      residential neurorehabilitation centre. Recovery was described using the 
      Pediatric Evaluation of Disability - Computer Adaptive Testing instrument. 
      Rehabilitation content was measured using the recently described Paediatric 
      Rehabilitation Ingredients Measure (PRISM) and examined using multidimensional 
      scaling. RESULTS: The PRISM reveals wide variation in rehabilitation content 
      between and during admissions primarily reflecting proportions of child active 
      practice, child emotional support, and other management of body structure and 
      function. Rehabilitation content is predicted by pre-admission recovery, 
      suggesting therapist decisions in designing rehabilitation programmes are shaped 
      by their initial expectations of recovery. However, significant correlations 
      persist between plausibly-related aspects of delivered therapy and observed 
      post-admission recovery after adjusting for such effects. INTERPRETATION: The 
      PRISM approach to the analysis of rehabilitation content shows promise in that it 
      demonstrates significant correlations between plausibly-related aspects of 
      delivered therapy and observed recovery that have been hard to identify with 
      other approaches. However, rigorous, causal analysis will be required to truly 
      understand the contributions of rehabilitation to recovery after pABI. WHAT THIS 
      PAPER ADDS: Rehabilitation content varies widely between, and during, admissions 
      for neurorehabilitation after paediatric acquire brain injury. Strong 
      correlations are seen between plausibly-related aspects of rehabilitation content 
      and observed recovery, though careful interpretation is necessary.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity and reliability of the PROMIS Sleep 
      Disturbance Item Bank Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-SD CAT) in patients on renal 
      replacement therapy, using the Insomnia Severity Index as the primary legacy 
      instrument. METHODS: Cross-sectional sample of adults on renal replacement 
      therapy completed PROMIS-SD CAT, Insomnia Severity Index, General Anxiety 
      Disorder-7, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised Renal, SF-12 
      questionnaires. Construct validity was confirmed by associations with legacy 
      instrument scores and measures of emotional wellbeing. Test-retest and scale 
      reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient and standard 
      errors of measurement, respectively. Discrimination was assessed using 
      receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 217 participants 
      (133 kidney transplant recipients, 84 on dialysis), 15% had moderate/severe sleep 
      disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index >/=15). PROMIS-SD CAT exhibited good 
      test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89, 95% confidence interval 
      (0.83-0.93)) and scale (>0.9 for T-scores 34-73) reliability. PROMIS-SD CAT 
      T-scores were strongly correlated with Insomnia Severity Index (rho = 0.85, 95% 
      confidence interval (0.81-0.88)), Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised 
      Renal Sleep Item (rho = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (0.69-0.81)) and moderately 
      with General Anxiety Disorder-7 scores and SF-12 Mental Component Summary scores 
      (p < 0.001 for all). PROMIS-SD CAT demonstrated outstanding discrimination for 
      moderate/severe insomnia (defined as Insomnia Severity Index >/=15) (AUROC 0.93, 
      95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.98)). PROMIS-SD CAT and Insomnia Severity Index 
      measurement characteristics were qualitatively similar between patients on 
      dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. CONCLUSIONS: These results support 
      PROMIS-SD CAT's validity and reliability for research and as potential screening 
      tool among patients on renal replacement therapy.

TI  - Developing a Web-Based App to Assess Mental Health Difficulties in Secondary 
      School Pupils: Qualitative User-Centered Design Study.
PG  - e30565
LID - 10.2196/30565 [doi]
LID - e30565
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary schools are an ideal setting to identify young people 
      experiencing mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression. However, 
      current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, 
      which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for 
      schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized 
      adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides 
      schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of 
      the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out 
      usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to 
      explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools. METHODS: 
      This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cycles-an initial stakeholder 
      consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered 
      design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and 
      interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health 
      professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: 
      Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user 
      interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. 
      The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The 
      unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy 
      to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional 
      features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide 
      them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four 
      themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the 
      anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for 
      designing mental health assessment apps are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Artemis-A 
      is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of 
      their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training. Future research will 
      evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Artemis-A in a range of UK 
      secondary schools.

TI  - Early detection of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants at 
      high risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months corrected age: 
      LEAP-CP prospective cohort study protocol.
PG  - e053646

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including cerebral palsy (CP), 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), are 
      characterised by impaired development of the early central nervous system, 
      impacting cognitive and/or physical function. Early detection of NDD enables 
      infants to be fast-tracked to early intervention services, optimising outcomes. 
      Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants may experience early life factors 
      increasing their risk of neurodevelopmental vulnerability, which persist into 
      later childhood, further compounding the health inequities experienced by First 
      Nations peoples in Australia. The LEAP-CP prospective cohort study will 
      investigate the efficacy of early screening programmes, implemented in 
      Queensland, Australia to earlier identify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
      infants who are 'at risk' of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (NDO) or NDD. 
      Diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of early detection tools for identifying 
      infants 'at risk' of a later diagnosis of adverse NDO or NDD will be determined. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander infants born in 
      Queensland, Australia (birth years 2020-2022) will be invited to participate. 
      Infants aged <9 months corrected age (CA) will undergo screening using the (1) 
      General Movements Assessment (GMA); (2) Hammersmith Infant Neurological 
      Examination (HINE); (3) Rapid Neurodevelopmental Assessment (RNDA) and (4) Ages 
      and Stages Questionnaire-Aboriginal adaptation (ASQ-TRAK). Developmental outcomes 
      at 12 months CA will be determined for: (1) neurological (HINE); (2) motor 
      (Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2); (3) cognitive and communication (Bayley 
      Scales of Infant Development III); (4) functional capabilities (Paediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test) and (5) behaviour 
      (Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment). Infants will be classified as 
      typically developing or 'at risk' of an adverse NDO and/or specific NDD based on 
      symptomology using developmental and diagnostic outcomes for (1) CP (2) ASD and 
      (3) FASD. The effects of perinatal, social and environmental factors, caregiver 
      mental health and clinical neuroimaging on NDOs will be investigated. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by appropriate Queensland ethics 
      committees; Far North Queensland Health Research Ethics Committee 
      (HREC/2019/QCH/50533 (Sep ver 2)-1370), the Townsville HHS Human Research Ethics

TI  - The promise of computer adaptive testing in collection of orthopaedic outcomes: 
      an evaluation of PROMIS utilization.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/s41687-021-00407-w [doi]
LID - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: A crucial component to improving patient care is better clinician 
      understanding of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In orthopaedic 
      surgery, HRQoL assessment instruments such as the NIH developed Patient Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), provide surgeons with a 
      framework to assess how a treatment or medical condition is affecting each 
      patient's HRQoL. PROMIS has been demonstrated as a valuable instrument in many 
      diseases; however, the extent to which orthopaedic surgery subspecialties have 
      used and validated PROMIS measures in peer-reviewed research is unclear. METHODS: 
      Systematic scoping methodology was used to investigate the characteristics of 
      studies using PROMIS to assess HRQoL measures as orthopaedic surgical outcomes as 
      well as studies validating computerized adaptive test (CAT) PROMIS physical 
      health (PH) domains including: Physical Function (PF), Upper Extremity (UE), 
      Lower Extremity (LE). RESULTS: A systematic search of PubMed identified 391 
      publications utilizing PROMIS in orthopaedics; 153 (39%) were PROMIS PH CAT 
      validation publications. One-hundred publications were in Hand and Upper 
      Extremity, 69 in Spine, 44 in Adult Reconstruction, 43 in Foot and Ankle, 43 in 
      Sports, 37 in Trauma, 31 in General orthopaedics, and 24 in Tumor. From 2011 
      through 2020 there was an upward trend in orthopaedic PROMIS publications each 
      year (range, 1-153) and an increase in studies investigating or utilizing PROMIS 
      PH CAT domains (range, 1-105). Eighty-five percent (n = 130) of orthopaedic 
      surgery PROMIS PH CAT validation publications (n = 153) analyzed PF; 30% (n = 46) 
      analyzed UE; 3% (n = 4) analyzed LE. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS utilization within 
      orthopaedics as a whole has significantly increased within the past decade, 
      particularly within PROMIS CAT domains. The existing literature reviewed in this 
      scoping study demonstrates that PROMIS PH CAT domains (PF, UE, and LE) are 
      reliable, responsive, and interpretable in most contexts of patient care 
      throughout all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties. The expanded use of PROMIS 
      CATs in orthopaedic surgery highlights the potential for improved quality of 
      patient care. While challenges of integrating PROMIS into electronic medical 
      records exist, expanded use of PROMIS CAT measurement instruments throughout 
      orthopaedic surgery should be performed. Plain english summary In orthopaedic 
      surgery, health-related quality of life tools such as the NIH developed Patient 
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), offer patients an 
      opportunity to better understand their medical condition and be involved in their 
      own care. Additionally, PROMIS provides surgeons with a framework to assess how a 
      treatment or medical condition is affecting each patient's functional status and 
      quality of life. The efficacy of PROMIS has been demonstrated in many diseases; 
      however, its application throughout orthopaedic care has yet to be depicted. This 
      study sought to identify the extent to which all orthopaedic surgery 
      subspecialties have used and validated PROMIS measures in peer-reviewed research 
      in order to identify its potential as an applicable and valuable tool across 
      specialties. We determined that PROMIS utilization has significantly increased 
      within the past decade. The existing literature reviewed in this scoping study 
      demonstrates that the PROMIS computerized adaptive test domains evaluating 
      physical function status are reliable, responsive, and interpretable in most 
      contexts of patient care throughout all orthopaedic surgery subspecialties. Based 
      on these results, this study recommends the expanded and more uniform use of 
      PROMIS computerized adaptive test measurement instruments in the clinical care of 
      orthopaedic patients.

TI  - Preoperative Assessment of Anxiety and Depression Using Computerized Adaptive 
      Screening Tools: A Pilot Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 853-857
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005844 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious mental health conditions (eg, anxiety and depression) are 
      common in surgical patients, yet likely underassessed due to the time-consuming 
      and cumbersome traditional screening process. A recently developed computerized 
      adaptive mental health assessment tool (computerized adaptive test-mental health 
      [CAT-MH]) allows rapid, precise, and accurate assessment of numerous mental 
      health disorders, including anxiety and depression, without the need for a 
      trained interviewer. The goal of this investigation was to determine the 
      feasibility of administering CAT-MH for anxiety and depression in the 
      preoperative setting and to obtain preliminary evidence of the prevalence of 
      anxiety and depression in preoperative patients. METHODS: In this prospective 
      cohort study, 100 adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled and 
      asked to complete the CAT-MH in the preoperative clinic. Urgent and emergency 
      surgeries were excluded as were pregnant patients. Primary feasibility outcomes 
      were completion rate and time to completion. Secondary outcomes were prevalence 
      estimates of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: All 100 enrolled patients completed 
      the study. All patients were able to complete the mental health assessment (mean 
      time: 3.6 +/- 1.8 minutes standard deviation). Sixteen patients (16%) screened 
      positive for anxiety (severity: mild, n = 7 [7%]; moderate, n = 7 [7%]); severe, 
      n = 2 [2%]); 12 of 16 (75%) did not have a previous diagnosis of anxiety 
      disorder. Twenty-eight (28%) patients screened positive for depression (severity: 
      mild, n = 26 [26%]; moderate and severe, n = 1 each [1%]); 23 of 28 (82%) had no 
      previous diagnosis of depressive disorder. Nineteen patients (19%) met the 
      screening criteria for major depressive disorder; 14 of 19 (74%) of which had no 
      previous diagnosis of major depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this 
      pilot study support the feasibility of using CAT-MH in a preoperative evaluation 
      and indicate that there is a substantial prevalence of undiagnosed anxiety and 
      depression in surgical patients.

PG  - 1089-1095
LID - 10.1302/2633-1462.212.BJO-2021-0154.R1 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) has 
      demonstrated faster administration, lower burden of data capture and reduced 
      floor and ceiling effects compared to traditional Patient Reported Outcomes 
      Measurements (PROMs). We investigated the suitability of PROMIS Mobility score in 
      assessing physical function in the sequelae of childhood hip disease. METHODS: In 
      all, 266 adolscents (aged >/= 12 years) and adults were identified with a prior 
      diagnosis of childhood hip disease (either Perthes' disease (n = 232 (87.2%)) or 
      Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (n = 34 (12.8%)) with a mean age of 27.73 years 
      (SD 12.24). Participants completed the PROMIS Mobility Computer Adaptive Test, 
      the Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), EuroQol five-dimension five-level 
      questionnaire, and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. We investigated the correlation 
      between the PROMIS Mobility and other tools to assess use in this population and 
      any clustering of outcome scores. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between 
      the PROMIS Mobility and other established PROMs; NAHS (r(s) = 0.79; p < 0.001). 
      There was notable clustering in PROMIS at the upper end of the distribution score 
      (42.5%), with less seen in the NAHS (20.3%). However, the clustering was broadly 
      similar between PROMIS Mobility and the comparable domains of the NAHS; function 
      (53.6%), and activity (35.0%). CONCLUSION: PROMIS Mobility strongly correlated 
      with other tools demonstrating convergent construct validity. There was 
      clustering of physical function scores at the upper end of the distributions, 
      which may reflect truncation of the data caused by participants having excellent 
      outcomes. There were elements of disease not captured within PROMIS Mobility 
      alone, and difficulties in differentiating those with the highest levels of 
      function. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(12):1089-1095.

TI  - Development of Reliable and Valid Negative Mood Screening Tools for Orthopaedic 
      Patients with Musculoskeletal Pain.
PG  - 313-324
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative mood is an important risk factor for poor clinical outcomes 
      among individuals with musculoskeletal pain. Screening for negative mood can aid 
      in identifying those who may need additional psychological interventions. 
      Limitations of current negative mood screening tools include (1) high response 
      burden, (2) a focus on single dimensions of negative mood, (3) poor precision for 
      identifying individuals with low or high negative mood levels, and/or (4) design 
      not specific for use in populations with orthopaedic conditions and 
      musculoskeletal pain. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Can item response theory methods be 
      used to construct screening tools for negative mood (such as depression, anxiety, 
      and anger) in patients undergoing physical therapy for orthopaedic conditions? 
      (2) Do these tools demonstrate reliability and construct validity when used in a 
      clinical setting? METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving outpatients 
      having physical therapy in tertiary-care settings. A total of 431 outpatients 
      with neck (n = 93), shoulder (n = 108), low back (n = 119), or knee (n = 111) 
      conditions were enrolled between December 2014 and December 2015, with 24% (103 
      of 431) seeking care after orthopaedic surgery. Participants completed three 
      validated psychological questionnaires measuring negative mood, resulting in 39 
      candidate items for item response theory analysis. Factor analysis was used to 
      identify the dimensions (factors) assessed by the candidate items and select 
      items that loaded on the main factor of interest (negative mood), establishing a 
      unidimensional item set. Unidimensionality of an item set suggests they are 
      assessing one main factor or trait, allowing unbiased score estimates. The 
      identified items were assessed for their fit to the graded item response theory 
      model. This model allows for items to vary by the level of difficulty they 
      represent and by their ability to discriminate between patients at different 
      levels of the trait being assessed, in this case, negative mood. Finally, a 
      hierarchical bifactor model where multiple subfactors are allowed to load on an 
      overall factor was used to confirm that the items identified as representing a 
      unidimensional item set explained the large majority of variance of the overall 
      factor, providing additional support for essential unidimensionality. Using the 
      final item bank, we constructed a computer adaptive test administration mode, and 
      reduced item sets were selected to create short forms including items with the 
      highest information (reliability) at targeted score levels of the trait being 
      measured, while also considering clinical content. RESULTS: We identified a 
      12-item bank for assessment of negative mood; eight-item and four-item short-form 
      versions were developed to reduce administrative burden. Computer adaptive test 
      administration used a mean +/- SD of 8 +/- 1 items. The item bank's reliability (0 = 
      no reliability; 1 = perfect reliability) was 0.89 for the computer adaptive test 
      administration, 0.86 for the eight-item short form, and 0.71 for the four-item 
      short form. Reliability values equal to or greater than 0.7 are considered 
      acceptable for group level measures. Construct validity sufficient for clinical 
      practice was supported by more severe negative mood scores among individuals with 
      a previous episode of pain in the involved anatomical region, pain and activity 
      limitations during the past 3 months, a work-related injury, education less than 
      a college degree, and income less than or equal to USD 50,000. CONCLUSION: These 
      newly derived tools include short-form and computer adaptive test options for 
      reliable and valid negative mood assessment in outpatient orthopaedic 
      populations. Future research should determine the responsiveness of these 
      measures to change and establish score thresholds for clinical decision-making. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Orthopaedic providers can use these tools to inform 
      prognosis, establish clinical benchmarks, and identify patients who may benefit 
      from psychological and/or behavioral treatments.

TI  - Modified Application of Cardiac Rehabilitation in Older Adults (MACRO) Trial: 
      Protocol changes in a pragmatic multi-site randomized controlled trial in 
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and 
      functional decline, often leading to deterioration and dependency. Cardiac 
      rehabilitation (CR) provides opportunity to improve clinical and functional 
      recovery, yet participation in CR decreases with age. Modified Application of CR 
      in Older Adults (MACRO) is a National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded pragmatic 
      trial that responds to this gap by aiming to increase enrollment of older adults 
      into CR and improving functional outcomes. This article describes the methodology 
      and novel features of the MACRO trial. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trial of a 
      coaching intervention (MACRO-I) vs. usual care for older adults (age >/= 70 years) 
      eligible for CR after an incident cardiac hospitalization. MACRO-I incorporates 
      innovations including holistic risk assessments, flexible CR format (i.e., 
      helping patients to select a CR design that aligns with their personal risks and 
      preferences), motivational prompts, nutritional emphasis, facilitated 
      deprescription, enhanced education, and home visits. Key modifications were 
      necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including switching from a 
      performance-based primary endpoint (Short Physical Performance Battery) to a 
      patient-reported measure (Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Computerized 
      Adaptive Testing). Changes prompted by COVID-19 maintain the original intent of 
      the trial and provide key methodologic advantages. CONCLUSIONS: MACRO is 
      exploring a novel individualized coaching intervention to better enable older 
      patients to participate in CR. Due to COVID-19 many aspects of the MACRO protocol 
      required modification, but the primary objective of the trial is maintained and 
      the updated protocol will more effectively achieve the original goals of the 
      study.

AB  - Itch compromises QOL, but most itch assessments focus only on itch intensity. We 
      aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatric measure for itch symptoms and 
      itch impact, defined as the effect specifically of itch on physical, mental, and 
      social health, all of which can affect life quality. After literature review, 
      concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with parents and children with itch, 
      and repeated content-expert review, an item pool was generated and refined. The 
      pool was calibrated with data from 499 children with pruritus using exploratory 
      and confirmatory factor analyses, item response theory, and item fit analysis. 
      The resultant 45-item bank, PROMIS Itch Questionnaire-Child (PIQ-C), showed good 
      convergent and discriminant validity in 181 children aged 8‒17 years, 
      discriminating children with different levels of severity, and was responsive to 
      change. Strong correlations (rho >/= 0.60) were observed with pain and sleep 
      measures, and moderate correlations were observed with other pediatric 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures. 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Itch Questionnaire-Child 
      comprehensively measures itch intensity and burden, providing an itch-specific 
      alternative for assessing life quality. The independent calibration of each 
      item/question allows for flexibility in generating short forms or computerized 
      adaptive testing for efficient use in research and office practice.

TI  - How Should We Measure Social Deprivation in Orthopaedic Patients?
PG  - 325-339
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social deprivation negatively affects a myriad of physical and 
      behavioral health outcomes. Several measures of social deprivation exist, but it 
      is unclear which measure is best suited to describe patients with orthopaedic 
      conditions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which measure of social deprivation, defined 
      as "limited access to society's resources due to poverty, discrimination, or 
      other disadvantage," is most strongly and consistently correlated with 
      patient-reported physical and behavioral health in patients with orthopaedic 
      conditions? (2) Compared with the use of a single measure alone, how much more 
      variability in patient-reported health does the simultaneous use of multiple 
      social deprivation measures capture? METHODS: Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 
      79,818 new patient evaluations occurred within the orthopaedic department of a 
      single, large, urban, tertiary-care academic center. Over that period, 
      standardized collection of patient-reported health measures (as described by the 
      Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]) was 
      implemented in a staged fashion throughout the department. We excluded the 25% 
      (19,926) of patient encounters that did not have associated PROMIS measures 
      reported, which left 75% (59,892) of patient encounters available for analysis in 
      this cross-sectional study of existing medical records. Five markers of social 
      deprivation were collected for each patient: national and state Area Deprivation 
      Index, Medically Underserved Area Status, Rural-Urban Commuting Area code, and 
      insurance classification (private, Medicare, Medicaid, or other). 
      Patient-reported physical and behavioral health was measured via PROMIS computer 
      adaptive test domains, which patients completed as part of standard care before 
      being evaluated by a provider. Adults completed the PROMIS Physical Function 
      version 1.2 or version 2.0, Pain Interference version 1.1, Anxiety version 1.0, 
      and Depression version 1.0. Children ages 5 to 17 years completed the PROMIS 
      Pediatric Mobility version 1.0 or version 2.0, Pain Interference version 1.0 or 
      version 2.0, Upper Extremity version 1.0, and Peer Relationships version 1.0. 
      Age-adjusted partial Pearson correlation coefficients were determined for each 
      social deprivation measure and PROMIS domain. Coefficients of at least 0.1 were 
      considered clinically meaningful for this purpose. Additionally, to determine the 
      percentage of PROMIS score variability that could be attributed to each social 
      deprivation measure, an age-adjusted hierarchical regression analysis was 
      performed for each PROMIS domain, in which social deprivation measures were 
      sequentially added as independent variables. The model coefficients of 
      determination (r2) were compared as social deprivation measures were 
      incrementally added. Improvement of the r2 by at least 10% was considered 
      clinically meaningful. RESULTS: Insurance classification was the social 
      deprivation measure with the largest (absolute value) age-adjusted correlation 
      coefficient for all adult and pediatric PROMIS physical and behavioral health 
      domains (adults: correlation coefficient 0.40 to 0.43 [95% CI 0.39 to 0.44]; 
      pediatrics: correlation coefficient 0.10 to 0.19 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.21]), followed 
      by national Area Deprivation Index (adults: correlation coefficient 0.18 to 0.22 
      [95% CI 0.17 to 0.23]; pediatrics: correlation coefficient 0.08 to 0.15 [95% CI 
      0.06 to 0.17]), followed closely by state Area Deprivation Index. The Medically 
      Underserved Area Status and Rural-Urban Commuting Area code each had correlation 
      coefficients of 0.1 or larger for some PROMIS domains but neither had 
      consistently stronger correlation coefficients than the other. Except for the 
      PROMIS Pediatric Upper Extremity domain, consideration of insurance 
      classification and the national Area Deprivation Index together explained more of 
      the variation in age-adjusted PROMIS scores than the use of insurance 
      classification alone (adults: r2 improvement 32% to 189% [95% CI 0.02 to 0.04]; 
      pediatrics: r2 improvement 56% to 110% [95% CI 0.01 to 0.02]). The addition of 
      the Medically Underserved Area Status, Rural-Urban Commuting Area code, and/or 
      state Area Deprivation Index did not further improve the r2 for any of the PROMIS 
      domains. CONCLUSION: To capture the most variability due to social deprivation in 
      orthopaedic patients' self-reported physical and behavioral health, insurance 
      classification (categorized as private, Medicare, Medicaid, or other) and 
      national Area Deprivation Index should be included in statistical analyses. If 
      only one measure of social deprivation is preferred, insurance classification or 
      national Area Deprivation Index are reasonable options. Insurance classification 
      may be more readily available, but the national Area Deprivation Index stratifies 
      patients across a wider distribution of values. When conducting clinical outcomes 
      research with social deprivation as a relevant covariate, we encourage 
      researchers to consider accounting for insurance classification and/or national 
      Area Deprivation Index, both of which are freely available and can be obtained 
      from data that are typically collected during routine clinical care. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

TI  - Assessment of Comorbid Depression and Anxiety in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Using 
      Adaptive Testing Technology.
LID - otaa095 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/crocol/otaa095 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are comorbidities of inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), and it is now recommended to screen IBD patients for these 
      conditions. We screened patients using a novel computerized adaptive testing 
      technology and compared the screening results to measures of disease activity. 
      METHODS: Consecutive patients at our tertiary IBD clinic were asked to complete 
      the validated CAT-MH survey (Adaptive Testing Technologies, Chicago, IL); we 
      then reviewed disease and patient characteristics. Clinical remission status was 
      determined based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopy and imaging results. 
      Statistical methods included Fisher's exact test and Pearson Chi-square tests to 
      assess association. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. 
      RESULTS: We included 134 patients, of which 34 (25.3%) screened positive for 
      depression and 18 (13.4%) screened positive for anxiety. We identified 19 (55.9 
      %) and 10 (55.5%) patients who were previously undiagnosed for depression and 
      anxiety, respectively. Patients in clinical remission were less likely to screen 
      positive for depression (OR 0.19; 95%CI 0.07-0.50) and for anxiety (OR 0.30; 
      95%CI 0.10-0.91). Compared to patients with negative CRP values, patients with 
      positive CRP were more likely to also screen positive for depression (p=0.025) 
      and anxiety (p=0.15). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of a novel testing 
      technology for screening patients with IBD for depression and anxiety. We found a 
      large number of patients with previously undiagnosed anxiety or depression and a 
      significant positive association between clinically active IBD and these mental 
      health conditions. This work supports and informs recommendations for mental 
      health screening in the IBD population.

TI  - School Readiness in Children Born <30 Weeks' Gestation at Risk for Developmental 
      Coordination Disorder: A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e312-e319
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000001031 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether school readiness 
      differs between children born <30 weeks' gestation who are classified as at risk 
      for developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and those who are not. METHODS: 
      This study was a prospective cohort study of children born <30 weeks' gestation. 
      Children were classified as at risk for DCD at a corrected age of 4 to 5 years if 
      they scored <16th centile on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second 
      Edition (MABC-2), had a full scale IQ score of >/=80 on the Wechsler Preschool and 
      Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV), and had no cerebral 
      palsy. Children were assessed on 4 school readiness domains: (1) health/physical 
      development [Physical Health domain of Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
      (PedsQL), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, 
      and Little Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire], (2) 
      social-emotional development (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and PedsQL 
      psychosocial domains), (3) cognitive skills/general knowledge (WPPSI-IV), and (4) 
      language skills (WPPSI-IV). RESULTS: Of 123 children assessed, 16 were ineligible 
      (IQ < 80 or cerebral palsy: n = 15; incomplete MABC-2: n = 1); 28 of 107 (26%) 
      eligible children were at risk for DCD. Children at risk for DCD had poorer 
      performance on all school readiness domains, with group differences of more than 
      0.4 SD in health/physical development, social-emotional development, and language 
      skills and up to 0.8 SD for cognitive skills/general knowledge compared with 
      those not at risk of DCD. CONCLUSION: Being at risk for DCD in children born <30 
      weeks' gestation is associated with challenges in multiple school readiness 
      domains, not only the health/physical domain.

TI  - Do Unhelpful Thoughts or Confidence in Problem Solving Have Stronger Associations 
      with Musculoskeletal Illness?
PG  - 287-295
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measures of unhelpful thoughts and distress correlate with the 
      intensity of pain and the magnitude of incapability among people seeking 
      musculoskeletal specialty care. In this evolving knowledge area, we want to be 
      sure we have not neglected other important mental health factors. This study 
      addressed how measures of confidence in problem solving as well as past and 
      current ability to achieve goals account for variation in symptoms and capability 
      independent of unhelpful thoughts and distress. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are 
      measures of confidence in problem solving ability and past and current ability to 
      achieve goals regarding future outcomes associated with variation in capability, 
      independent of measures of symptoms of depression and anxiety (distress) and 
      measures of unhelpful thoughts (worst-case thinking, negative pain thoughts)? (2) 
      Are these measures independently associated with variation in pain intensity? (3) 
      Are these measures associated with measures of symptoms of depression, symptoms 
      of anxiety, and unhelpful thoughts? METHODS: Over a 7-month period during the 
      pandemic, we enrolled sporadically from the offices of four surgeons treating 
      patients who sought care for various upper and lower extremity conditions. We 
      invited approximately 200 adult new and returning patients to participate (the 
      number of invitations was not formally tracked) and 187 accepted. Thirty-one were 
      excluded due to markedly incomplete entries (related to a problematic attempt to 
      use the patient's cell phone to complete questionnaires as a pandemic work 
      around), leaving 156 for analysis. Patients completed an 11-point ordinal rating 
      of pain intensity, two measures of unhelpful thoughts (the Pain Catastrophizing 
      Scale and the Negative Pain Thoughts Questionnaire), the Adult Hope Scale to 
      measure past and current ability to achieve goals, the Personal Optimism and 
      Self-Efficacy Optimism Scale to measure confidence in problem solving ability, 
      the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer 
      adaptive test to measure symptoms of anxiety, the PROMIS computer adaptive test 
      to measure symptoms of depression, and the PROMIS physical function computer 
      adaptive test to assess the magnitude of capability. All questionnaires were 
      validated in previous studies. We used bivariate analyses to identify factors 
      associated with magnitude of capability, pain intensity, confidence in problem 
      solving ability, and past and current ability to achieve goals. All factors with 
      a p value of less than 0.1 were included in multivariable analyses to seek 
      associations between these measures accounting for confounders. We reported 
      partial eta2 as a measure of effect size for all multivariable regression models. 
      The following rules of thumb are used to interpret values for partial eta2: a value 
      of 0.01 = small, 0.06 = medium, and values of 0.14 and higher show large effect 
      size. RESULTS: Greater capability was modestly associated with fewer negative 
      pain thoughts (beta = -0.63 [95% CI -1.0 to -0.22]; standard error = 0.20; partial 
      eta2 = 0.06; p = 0.003) and no self-reported comorbidities (beta = 2.6 [95% CI 0.02 to 
      5.3]; standard error = 1.3; partial eta2 = 0.03; p = 0.048) after controlling for 
      education, symptoms of depression and anxiety, worst-case thinking, as well as 
      past and current ability to achieve goals. In a similar multivariable model, 
      greater pain intensity was modestly associated with greater worst-case thinking 
      (beta = 0.33 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.45]; standard error = 0.06; partial eta2 = 0.16; p < 
      0.001) and established patients (beta = -1.1 [95% CI -1.8 to -0.31]; standard error 
      = 0.38; partial eta2 = 0.05; p = 0.006). In another similar multivariable model, 
      having more confidence in problem solving ability had a limited association with 
      higher ratings of past and current ability to achieve goals (beta = 0.15 [95% CI 
      0.09 to 0.21]; standard error = 0.03; partial eta2 = 0.13; p < 0.001). In a final 
      multivariable model, lower past and current ability to achieve goals was 
      independently associated with having greater symptoms of depression (beta = -0.45 
      [95% CI -0.67 to -0.23]; standard error = 0.11; partial eta2 = 0.1; p < 0.001) and 
      more negative pain thoughts (beta = -0.49 [95% CI -0.89 to -0.09]; standard error = 
      0.20; partial eta2 = 0.04; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The observation that unhelpful 
      thoughts about symptoms are more strongly associated with symptom intensity than 
      past and current ability to achieve goals and confidence in problem solving 
      ability add to the evidence that attentiveness to unhelpful thinking is an 
      important aspect of musculoskeletal health. Musculoskeletal specialists can 
      prioritize communication strategies such as relationship building and 
      motivational interviewing that develop trust and facilitate reorientation of 
      common unhelpful thoughts. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

TI  - Relationship between the more-affected upper limb function and daily activity 
      performance in children with cerebral palsy: a cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are differences in roles between the more-affected and 
      less-affected upper limb of children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, there is 
      a lack of studies of the relationship between the more-affected limb function and 
      activities of daily living (ADL) in children with CP. Thus, the aim of this 
      prospective cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between 
      more-affected upper limb function and ADL in children with CP. METHODS: Children 
      with spastic CP (unilateral CP n = 28, bilateral CP n = 31; 34 males, 25 females; 
      mean age +/- SD, 6.8 +/- 3.1y [range, 3-14y]) participated in this study. Function of 
      the more-affected upper limb was measured using the Melbourne Assessment of 
      Unilateral Upper limb Function, version 2 (MA2) and the Upper Limb Physician's 
      Rating Scale (ULPRS). Performance of daily living activities was measured using 
      the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test 
      (PEDI-CAT). RESULTS: The range, accuracy and fluency dimension of MA2 and ULPRS 
      total scores were moderately correlated with the daily activity domain (r = 0.47, 
      0.47, 0.56 for MA2 and r = 0.50 for ULPRS, respectively; P < 0.001) rather than 
      the mobility, social/cognitive, and responsibility domains of the PEDI-CAT. ULPRS 
      scores for elbow extension, supination in extension, supination in flexion, and 
      two-handed function were moderately correlated with the PEDI-CAT daily activity 
      domain (r = 0.44, 0.43, 0.41, and 0.49, respectively; P < 0.01). Finger opening 
      and thumb-in-palm deformity of the ULPRS did not correlate with any PEDI-CAT 
      domain. CONCLUSIONS: The MA2 range, accuracy, and fluency domains (rather than 
      dexterity) had the strongest correlations with the PEDI-CAT daily activity 
      domain. Elbow extension, forearm supination, and two-handed function (rather than 
      wrist and finger movements) of the ULPRS had the strongest correlations with the 
      PEDI-CAT daily activity domain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There remains a paucity of information analyzing which factors most 
      influence preoperative expectations for patients undergoing reverse total 
      shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). The purposes of our study were to characterize 
      preoperative patient expectations for those scheduled to undergo RTSA and to 
      determine the impact of demographic factors, shoulder function, and shoulder pain 
      on these preoperative expectations. METHODS: Patients were prospectively 
      recruited into the study if they were scheduled to undergo an elective unilateral 
      primary RTSA for a diagnosis of glenohumeral arthritis. Preoperative patient 
      expectations were evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery's Shoulder 
      Surgery Expectation Survey. Patients also completed the American Shoulder and 
      Elbow Surgeons shoulder score, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function-Upper Extremity computer adaptive 
      test (version 2.0), the PROMIS Pain Interference (PI) computer adaptive test 
      (version 1.1), the PROMIS Depression computer adaptive test (version 1.0), visual 
      analog scores, and an itemized satisfaction questionnaire, which paralleled the 
      Hospital for Special Surgery's Shoulder Surgery Expectation Survey. Demographic 
      data and preoperative shoulder range of motion (ROM) were also recorded. RESULTS: 
      A total of 107 patients scheduled to undergo RTSA were included in the study. 
      Relief of daytime pain (n = 91, 85%), improvement in self-care (n = 86, 80%), and 
      improvement in shoulder ROM (n = 85, 79%) were most commonly cited as "very 
      important" expectations. In the item-specific analysis, lower PROMIS Upper 
      Extremity scores were correlated with greater expectations for the ability to 
      reach sideways (P = .015) and the ability to perform daily activities (P = .018). 
      Patients with lower shoulder ROM had greater expectations for improved shoulder 
      ROM (internal rotation with arm at 90 degrees , P = .004) and an improved ability to 
      perform daily activities (forward elevation, P = .038; abduction, P = .009). In 
      the cumulative analysis, a greater number of very important expectations was 
      associated with African American race (P = .013), higher PROMIS PI score (r = 
      0.351, P = .004), and lower overall preoperative satisfaction (r = 0.334, P < 
      .001). CONCLUSION: Patients scheduled to undergo RTSA have the greatest 
      expectations for relief of daytime pain, improvement in self-care, and 
      improvement in shoulder ROM. Patients with limited preoperative ROM have greater 
      expectations for improvement in self-care and the ability to perform daily 
      activities in addition to expectations for improvement in shoulder ROM. Greater 
      overall expectations for surgery were not associated with preoperative physical 
      function but were instead associated with lower preoperative satisfaction and 
      higher PROMIS PI scores.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multidimensional computerized adaptive test, 
      the Functional Assessment in Acute Care Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive 
      Test (FAMCAT), could be administered to hospitalized patients via a tablet 
      computer rather than being orally administered by an interviewer. DESIGN: A 
      randomized comparison of the responses of hospitalized patients to interviewer vs 
      tablet delivery of the FAMCAT and its assessment of applied cognition, daily 
      activity, and basic mobility. SETTING: Two quaternary teaching hospitals in the 
      Upper Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 300 patients (127 men, 165 women), 
      average age 61.2 (range, 18-97) hospitalized on medical services or 
      rehospitalized on surgical services were randomly assigned to either a tablet 
      (150) or an interview (150) group. INTERVENTION: Electronic tablet vs interview. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Item response theory point estimates of the FAMCAT latent 
      scales, their psychometric standard errors, number of items administered per 
      domain, the determinant (an indicator of overall precision of the latent trait 
      vector), as well as the time that patients required to complete their FAMCAT 
      sessions. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients, 292 completed their assessments. The 
      assessments of 4 individuals in each group was interrupted by clinical care and 
      were not included in the analyses. A significant (P=.009) mode effect (ie, 
      interview vs tablet) was identified when all outcome variables were considered 
      simultaneously. However, the only outcome that was affected by the administration 
      mode was test duration: tablet administration reduced the roughly 6-minute test 
      time required by both approaches by only 20 seconds, which, though statistically 
      significant, was clinically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of a FAMCAT 
      assessment, at least for this cohort of hospitalized patients, are independent of 
      administration via tablet computer or interview.

TI  - Analysis of Magnetic Nondestructive Measurement Methods for Determination of the 
      Degradation of Reactor Pressure Vessel Steel.
LID - 10.3390/ma14185256 [doi]
LID - 5256
AB  - Nondestructive magnetic measurement methods can be successfully applied to 
      determine the embrittlement of nuclear pressure vessel steel caused by neutron 
      irradiation. It was found in previous works that reasonable correlation could be 
      obtained between the nondestructively measured magnetic parameters and 
      destructively determined ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. However, a 
      large scatter of the measurement points was detected even in the cases of the 
      non-irradiated reference samples. The reason for their scattering was attributed 
      to the local inhomogeneity of material. This conclusion is verified in the 
      present work by applying three different magnetic methods on two sets of Charpy 
      samples made of two different reactor steel materials. It was found that by an 
      optimal magnetic pre-selection of samples, a good, linear correlation can be 
      found between magnetic parameters as well as the ductile-to-brittle transition 
      temperature with low scattering of points. This result shows that neutron 
      irradiation embrittlement depends very much on the local material properties.

TI  - Identifying the content for an item bank and computerized adaptive testing system 
      to measure the impact of age-related macular degeneration on health-related 
      quality of life.
PG  - 1237-1246
LID - 10.1007/s11136-021-02989-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We are developing an age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) item bank, applicable to Western and Asian 
      populations. We report primarily on content generation and refinement, but also 
      compare the HRQoL issues reported in our study with Western studies and current 
      AMD-HRQoL questionnaires. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, qualitative study of 
      AMD patients attending the Singapore National Eye Centre (May-December 2019), 
      items/domains were generated from: (1) AMD-specific questionnaires; (2) published 
      articles; (3) focus groups/semi-structured interviews with AMD patients (n = 27); 
      and (4) written feedback from retinal experts. Following thematic analysis, items 
      were systematically refined to a minimally representative set and pre-tested 
      using cognitive interviews with 16 AMD patients. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients 
      (mean +/- standard deviation age 67.9 +/- 7.0; 59.2% male), 18 (66.7%), two (7.4%), 
      and seven (25.9%) had no, early-intermediate, and late/advanced AMD (better eye), 
      respectively. Whilst some HRQoL issues, e.g. activity limitation, mobility, 
      lighting, and concerns were similarly reported by Western patients and covered by 
      other questionnaires, others like anxiety about intravitreal injections, work 
      tasks, and financial dependency were novel. Overall, 462 items within seven 
      independent HRQoL domains were identified: Activity limitation, Lighting, 
      Mobility, Emotional, Concerns, AMD management, and Work. Following item 
      refinement, items were reduced to 219, with 31 items undergoing amendment. 
      CONCLUSION: Our 7-domain, 219-item AMD-specific HRQoL instrument will undergo 
      psychometric testing and calibration for computerized adaptive testing. The 
      future instrument will enable users to precisely, rapidly, and comprehensively 
      quantify the HRQoL impact of AMD and associated treatments, with item coverage 
      relevant across several populations.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the spinal cord injury-quality of life (SCI-QOL) 
      Resilience item bank in a sample with spinal cord injury and chronic pain.
PG  - 927-936

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the psychometric properties (e.g., data distribution 
      characteristics, convergent/discriminant validity, internal consistency 
      reliability, and test administration characteristics) of the spinal cord injury 
      quality of life measurement system (SCI-QOL) Resilience item bank delivered as a 
      computer adaptive test (CAT) in a sample of individuals with chronic pain and 
      spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Descriptive statistics were calculated to 
      investigate variable data distribution characteristics. Correlation analyses were 
      conducted for convergent and discriminant validity. Item response theory-derived 
      reliability was calculated for the SCI-QOL Resilience CAT. RESULT: One hundred 
      thirty-three adults with SCI (N = 133; 73.5% male, 26.5% female) were enrolled. 
      Sample mean T score on the SCI-QOL Resilience measure was 48.40, SD = 8.60 
      (min = 29.4; max = 70.0). The CAT administered between 4 (most common, 41.4% of 
      cases) and 12 (9% of cases) items with the Mean(#items) = 5.73, SD = 2.45. The 
      SCI-QOL Resilience CAT scores were normally distributed, with very low ceiling 
      (0%) and floor (3%) effects. The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT had a reliability of 
      0.89, and the mean length of time for respondents to complete the SCI-QOL 
      Resilience CAT was 44.34 s. SCI-QOL Resilience CAT validity was supported by 
      significant moderate correlations with pain acceptance, depressive symptoms, pain 
      catastrophizing, positive affect and well-being, and pain interference 
      (convergent validity) and small non-significant correlations with age, sex, 
      injury level, pain intensity, mobility level, and years since injury 
      (discriminant validity). CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL Resilience CAT demonstrated good 
      convergent and discriminant validity. The CAT administration characteristics were 
      impressive: With few items (low response burden), the scale achieved good 
      reliability.

TI  - A framework to make PROMs relevant to patients: qualitative study of 
      communication preferences of PROMs.
PG  - 1093-1103
LID - 10.1007/s11136-021-02972-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patient-reported outcome measures are tools for evaluating symptoms, 
      magnitude of limitations, baseline health status, and outcomes from the patient's 
      perspective. Healthcare professional organizations and payers increasingly 
      recommend PROMs for clinical care, but there lacks guidance regarding effective 
      communication of PROMs with orthopedic surgery patients. This qualitative study 
      aimed to identify (1) patient attitudes toward the use and communication of 
      PROMs, and (2) what patients feel are the most relevant or important aspects of 
      PROM results to discuss with their physicians. METHODS: Participants were 
      recruited from a multispeciality orthopedic clinic. Three PROMs: the EuroQol-5 
      Dimension, the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, and the Patient-Reported 
      Outcome Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test 
      were shown and a semi-structured interview was conducted to elicit PROMs 
      attitudes and preferences. Interviews were transcribed and inductive-deductively 
      coded. Coded excerpts were aggregated to (1) identify major themes and (2) 
      analyze how themes interacted. RESULT: Three themes emerged: (1) Beliefs toward 
      the purpose of PROMs, (2) PROMs as a reflection of self, and (3) PROMs to 
      facilitate communication and guide healthcare decisions. These themes informed a 
      framework outlining the patient perspective on communicating PROMs during 
      clinical care. CONCLUSION: Patient attitudes toward the use and communication of 
      PROMs start with the incorporation of patient beliefs, which can facilitate or 
      act as a barrier to engagement. Patients should ideally believe that PROMs are an 
      accurate reflection of personal health state before incorporation into care. 
      Clinicians should endeavor to communicate the purpose of a chosen PROM in line 
      with a patient's unique needs and what they feel is most relevant to their own 
      care. Aspects of PROMs results which may be helpful to address include providing 
      context for what scores mean and how they are calculated, and using scores as a 
      way to weigh risks and benefits of treatment and tracking progress over time. 
      Future research can focus on the effect of communication strategies on patient 
      outcomes and engagement in care.

TI  - Using computerised adaptive tests to screen for perinatal depression in 
      underserved women of colour.
PG  - 23-28
LID - 10.1136/ebmental-2021-300262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with traditional screening questionnaires, computerised 
      adaptive tests for severity of depression (CAT-DI) and computerised adaptive 
      diagnostic modules for depression (CAD-MDD) show improved precision in screening 
      for major depressive disorder. CAT measures have been tailored to perinatal women 
      but have not been studied in low-income women of colour despite high rates of 
      perinatal depression (PND). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the 
      concordance between CAT and traditional measures of depression in a sample of 
      primarily low-income black and Latina women. METHODS: In total, 373 women (49% 
      black; 29% Latina) completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), CAD-MDD 
      and CAT-DI at 845 visits across pregnancy and postpartum. We examined the 
      concordance between continuous CAT-DI and PHQ-9 scores and between binary 
      measures of PND diagnosis on CAD-MDD and the PHQ-9 (cut-off score >10). We 
      examined cases with a positive PND diagnosis on the CAD-MDD but not on the PHQ-9 
      ('missed' cases) to determine whether clinic notes were consistent with CAD-MDD 
      results. FINDINGS: CAT-DI and PHQ-9 scores were significantly associated 
      (concordance correlation coefficient=0.67; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.74). CAD-MDD detected 
      5% more case of PND compared with PHQ-9 (p<0.001). The average per-visit rate of 
      PND was 14.4% (14.5% in blacks, 14.9% in Latinas) on the CAD-MDD, and 9.5% (9.8% 
      in blacks, 8.8% in Latinas) on the PHQ-9. Clinical notes were available on 60% of 
      'missed' cases and validated CAD-MDD PND diagnosis in 89% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: 
      CAD-MDD detected 5% more cases of PND in women of colour compared with 
      traditional tests, and the majority of these cases were verified by clinician 
      notes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of CAT in routine clinic care may address 
      health disparities in PND screening.

AB  - We evaluated construct validity, responsiveness, and utility of change indicators 
      of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS adult v1.0 item banks for Depression and Anxiety 
      administered as computerized adaptive test (CAT). Specifically, the CATs were 
      compared to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) using pre- and re-test data of 
      adult patients treated for common mental disorders (N = 400; median 
      pre-to-re-test interval = 215 days). Construct validity was evaluated with 
      Pearson's correlations and Cohen's ds; responsiveness with Pearson's correlations 
      and pre-post effect sizes (ES); utility of change indicators with kappa 
      coefficients and percentages of (dis)agreement. The results showed that the 
      PROMIS CATs measure similar constructs as matching BSI scales. Under the 
      assumption of measuring similar constructs, the CAT and BSI Depression scales 
      were similarly responsive. For the Anxiety scales, we found a higher 
      responsiveness for CAT (ES = 0.64) compared to the BSI (ES = 0.50). Finally, both 
      CATs categorized the change scores of more patients as changed compared to 
      matching BSI scales, indicating that the PROMIS CATs may be more able to detect 
      actual change than the BSI. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be 
      considered a modest improvement over matching BSI scales as tools for reviewing 
      treatment progress with patients. We discuss several additional differences 
      between the PROMIS CATs and the BSI to help test users choose instruments. These 
      differences include the adopted measurement theory (Item Response Theory vs. 
      Classical Test Theory), the mode of administration (CAT vs. fixed items), and the 
      area of application (universal vs. predominantly clinical). (PsycInfo Database

TI  - A randomized pilot study of Rhythms And You (RAY): An internet-based program for 
      bipolar disorder administered with and without clinical helper support in primary 
      care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhythms And You (RAY) is an online intervention for bipolar disorders 
      (BD) based on Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy. We examined RAY's 
      feasibility and acceptability for individuals with BD recruited from primary 
      care. Because online interventions may be more effective when paired with human 
      support, we evaluated RAY with and without weekly brief ( approximately 5 min) calls from 
      clinical helpers (CH). METHODS: Participants (n = 47) meeting criteria for BD I, 
      II or other specified BD, presenting for primary care, were randomly assigned to 
      RAY, RAY-CH, or Adjunctive Reading Material (ARM) control. RAY consisted of 12 
      weekly online modules. ARM consisted of 12 weekly emails. Participants were 
      assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: RAY showed high completion 
      rates and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire scores (36/47, 77% and 25.1 +/- 5.5, 
      respectively; no group differences). Effect sizes for RAY- CH ranged from small 
      [Internal State Scale-Activation Subscale (ISS-ACT); d = 0.3] to large [SF-12 
      Mental Health Composite Score (SF-12 MHC); d = 1.3]. ARM also showed moderate 
      effects (ISS-ACT d = 0.7; Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, d = 0.8). SF-12 
      MHC scores showed a time*group interaction (F = 2.38, df = 6,32, p = 0.05) 
      favoring RAY-CH. Number of logins trended toward significant association with 
      improved social rhythm regularity (F = 4.09, df = 1, 17, p = 0.06). LIMITATIONS: 
      Sample size is small, limiting conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Remote 
      delivery of RAY for individuals with BD is feasible and acceptable. More time 
      spent engaged in RAY was associated with greater improvement in social rhythm 
      regularity. Preliminary evidence suggests adding brief human support to RAY may 
      yield better outcomes.

TI  - Are Patient Linguistic Tones Associated with Mental Health and Perceived 
      Clinician Empathy?
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.21.00124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal specialists have the expertise to distinguish between 
      (1) symptoms that correspond well with observed pathophysiology and (2) 
      disproportionate or incongruent symptoms that may suggest mental and social 
      health opportunities. There is evidence that patient verbal and nonverbal 
      communication can help with this discernment. This study carried this line of 
      research one step further by addressing whether patient linguistic tones, as 
      assessed with use of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), are associated 
      with symptoms of depression and health anxiety. We also sought associations 
      between both patient and clinician linguistic tones and patient-perceived 
      clinician empathy. METHODS: A secondary analysis of transcripts of video and 
      audio recordings of 109 adult patients seeking musculoskeletal specialty care was 
      performed. Patients also completed questionnaires quantifying symptoms of 
      depression (PROMIS [Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System] 
      Depression computerized adaptive test), self-efficacy when in pain (Pain 
      Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, 2-question version), symptoms of health anxiety 
      (5-item Short Health Anxiety Inventory [SHAI-5]), and perceived clinician empathy 
      (Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy [JSPPPE]). LIWC was 
      used to detect the relative strength of various emotional tones, cognitive 
      processes, and core drives and needs. Bivariate and multivariable regression 
      analyses sought factors associated with symptoms of depression, symptoms of 
      health anxiety, and patient perception of clinician empathy. RESULTS: With 
      greater levels of depression, patients express less emotion overall as detected 
      with use of computational linguistic analysis. After accounting for demographic 
      variables, there were no specific linguistic tones associated with health anxiety 
      and symptoms of depression. Stronger negative linguistic tones were associated 
      with lower pain self-efficacy. Greater perceived clinician empathy was associated 
      with more words spoken by the clinician and the patient, greater patient use of 
      adjectives, lower prevalence of patient tones of "analytic," lower clinician 
      tones of "social," and greater tones of "cause." CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal 
      specialists cannot depend on people experiencing symptoms of psychological 
      distress to verbally express their feelings. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Specialists may 
      be more likely to identify important symptoms of psychological distress if they 
      anticipate lower emotional expressiveness and are attentive to specific words, 
      concepts, and mannerisms known to be associated with distress.

TI  - Comparison of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      Computerized Adaptive Testing Versus Fixed Short Forms in Juvenile Myositis.
LID - 10.1002/acr.24760 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      measures can be administered via computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or fixed 
      short forms (FSFs), but the empirical benefits of CAT versus FSFs are unknown in 
      juvenile myositis (JM). The present study was undertaken to assess whether PROMIS 
      CAT is feasible, precise, correlated with FSFs, and less prone to respondent 
      burden and floor/ceiling effects than FSFs in JM. METHODS: Patients 8-17 years of 
      age (self-report and parent proxy) and parents of patients 5-7 years of age (only 
      parent proxy) completed PROMIS fatigue, pain interference, upper extremity 
      function, mobility, anxiety, and depressive symptoms measures. Pearson 
      correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were calculated between PROMIS CAT 
      and FSFs. McNemar's test assessed floor/ceiling effects between CAT and FSFs. 
      Precision and respondent burden were examined across the T score range. RESULTS: 
      Data from 67 patient-parent dyads were analyzed. CAT and FSF mean scores did not 
      significantly differ except in parent proxy anxiety and fatigue (effect size 0.23 
      and 0.19, respectively). CAT had less pronounced floor/ceiling effects at the 
      less symptomatic extreme in all domains except self-report anxiety. Increased 
      item burden and higher SEs were seen in less symptomatic scorers for CAT. 
      Modified stopping rules limiting CAT item administration did not decrease 
      precision. CONCLUSION: PROMIS CAT appears to be feasible and correlated with 
      FSFs. CAT had less pronounced floor/ceiling effects, allowing detection of 
      individual differences in less symptomatic patients. Modified stopping rules for 
      CAT may decrease respondent burden. CAT can be considered for long-term follow-up 
      of JM patients.

TI  - Validation of PROMIS-29 domain scores among adult burn survivors: A National

      Model System Study.
PG  - 213-222
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000003365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are important for understanding recovery 
      after burn injury, benchmarking service delivery and measuring the impact of 
      interventions. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS)-29 domains have been validated for use among diverse populations though 
      not among burn survivors. The purpose of this study was to examine validity and 
      reliability of PROMIS-29 scores in this population. METHODS: The PROMIS-29 scores 
      of physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to 
      participate in social roles, and pain interference were evaluated for validity 
      and reliability in adult burn survivors. Unidimensionality, floor and ceiling 
      effects, internal consistency, and reliability were examined. Differential item 
      functioning was used to examine bias with respect to demographic and injury 
      characteristics. Correlations with measures of related constructs (Community 
      Integration Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Post-Traumatic Stress 
      Checklist-Civilian, and Veteran's Rand-12) and known-group differences were 
      examined. RESULTS: Eight hundred and seventy-six burn survivors with moderate to 
      severe injury from 6 months to 20 years postburn provided responses on PROMIS-29 
      domains. Participants' ages ranged from 18 years to 93 years at time of 
      assessment; mean years since injury was 3.4. All PROMIS domain scores showed high 
      internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87-0.97). There was a large ceiling effect 
      on ability to participate in social roles (39.7%) and physical function (43.3%). 
      One-factor confirmatory factor analyses supported unidimensionality (all 
      comparative fit indices >0.95). We found no statistically significant bias 
      (differential item functioning). Reliability was high (>0.9) across trait levels 
      for all domains except sleep, which reached moderate reliability (>0.85). All 
      known-group differences by demographic and clinical characteristics were in the 
      hypothesized direction and magnitude except burn size categories. CONCLUSION: The 
      results provide strong evidence for reliability and validity of PROMIS-29 domain 
      scores among adult burn survivors. Reliability of the extreme scores could be 
      increased and the ceiling effects reduced by administering PROMIS-43, which 
      includes six items per domain, or by administering by computerized adaptive 
      testing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Test or Criteria, level III.

TI  - Can PROMIS measures be used to create subgroups for patients seeking orthopaedic 
      care?

AB  - AIMS: Patient-reported outcome measures have become an important part of routine 
      care. The aim of this study was to determine if Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures can be used to create patient 
      subgroups for individuals seeking orthopaedic care. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study of patients from Duke University Department of Orthopaedic 
      Surgery clinics (14 ambulatory and four hospital-based). There were two separate 
      cohorts recruited by convenience sampling (i.e. patients were included in the 
      analysis only if they completed PROMIS measures during a new patient visit). 
      Cohort #1 (n = 12,141; December 2017 to December 2018,) included PROMIS short 
      forms for eight domains (Physical Function, Pain Interference, Pain Intensity, 
      Depression, Anxiety, Sleep Quality, Participation in Social Roles, and Fatigue) 
      and Cohort #2 (n = 4,638; January 2019 to August 2019) included PROMIS Computer 
      Adaptive Testing instruments for four domains (Physical Function, Pain 
      Interference, Depression, and Sleep Quality). Cluster analysis (K-means method) 
      empirically derived subgroups and subgroup differences in clinical and 
      sociodemographic factors were identified with one-way analysis of variance. 
      RESULTS: Cluster analysis yielded four subgroups with similar clinical 
      characteristics in Cohort #1 and #2. The subgroups were: 1) Normal Function: 
      within normal limits in Physical Function, Pain Interference, Depression, and 
      Sleep Quality; 2) Mild Impairment: mild deficits in Physical Function, Pain 
      Interference, and Sleep Quality but with Depression within normal limits; 3) 
      Impaired Function, Not Distressed: moderate deficits in Physical Function and 
      Pain Interference, but within normal limits for Depression and Sleep Quality; and 
      4) Impaired Function, Distressed: moderate (Physical Function, Pain Interference, 
      and Sleep Quality) and mild (Depression) deficits. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      suggest orthopaedic patient subgroups differing in physical function, pain, and 
      psychosocial distress can be created from as few as four different PROMIS 
      measures. Longitudinal research is necessary to determine whether these subgroups 
      have prognostic validity. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(7):493-502.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Veterans from recent and past conflicts have high rates of 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adaptive testing strategies can increase 
      accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while 
      decreasing patient and clinician burden. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a 
      computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test 
      (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A diagnostic 
      study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health 
      Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The 
      study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item 
      bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical 
      Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 
      participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for 
      DSM-5. RESULTS: Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 
      (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD 
      for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an 
      area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated 
      convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r = 0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis 
      (area under the curve = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the 
      final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r = 0.95 with a mean of only 10 
      adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study 
      was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a 
      mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent 
      convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. 
      The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic 
      accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic 
      screening and severity measurement are possible.

      Pediatric Chronic Pain.

AB  - Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are utilized in clinical registries and trials, 
      necessitating development of benchmarks to enhance interpretability. This study 
      aimed to 1) examine if PROMIS measures administered via computer adaptive testing 
      (CAT) were responsive to change, and 2) highlight one method of assessing 
      clinically significant change for youth seen in a tertiary pain clinic. 
      Clinically significant change was achieved if patients had significantly reliable 
      pre-to-post-changes greater than Reliable Change Index (RCI) value and reported 
      decreased symptoms by at least one severity level (e.g., moderate to mild). 
      Participants were 328 youth (8-17 years old) seen in a tertiary pediatric pain 
      management clinic. Small to moderate effect sizes were noted across PROMIS 
      measures (except Peer Relations). Reliable magnitudes of change were estimated 
      for this sample as approximately 6 point reduction for Pain Interference and 
      Mobility, 9 for Fatigue, and 11 for Anxiety and Depression. Depending on the 
      measure, 10 to 24% were categorized as improved, 3 to 6% as deteriorated, and 68 
      to 81% were either not clinically elevated at baseline or remained unchanged at 3 
      months. Overall, PROMIS CAT measures demonstrated responsiveness to change over 
      time. Estimation of clinically significant change offers preliminary yet rigorous 
      benchmarks for evaluating treatment response and sets the stage for understanding 
      treatment effects. PERSPECTIVE: This study assesses responsiveness of CAT 
      administered PROMIS measures and highlights one methodological approach of 
      presenting clinical significance for assessing treatment outcomes in pediatric 
      chronic pain. These benchmarks will allow clinicians and researchers to evaluate 
      treatment response utilizing PROs while allowing for a deeper understanding of 
      treatment effects.

AB  - Pediatric burn injuries can alter the trajectory of the survivor's entire life. 
      Patient-centered outcome measures are helpful to assess unique physical and 
      psychosocial needs and long-term recovery. This study aimed to develop a 
      conceptual framework to measure pediatric burn outcomes in survivors aged 5 to 12 
      years as a part of the School-Aged Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation Computer 
      Adaptive Test (SA-LIBRE5-12 CAT) development. This study conducted a systematic 
      literature review guided by the WHO International Classification of 
      Functioning-Child and Youth and domains in the American Burn Association/Shriners 
      Hospitals for Children Burn Outcomes Questionnaire5-18. Interviews with eight 
      parents and seven clinicians were conducted to identify important domains in 
      child recovery. One clinician focus group with four clinicians was completed to 
      identify gaps in the preliminary framework, and semiweekly expert consensus 
      meetings were conducted with three experts to solidify the framework. Qualitative 
      data were analyzed by grounded theory methodology. Three major thematic outcome 
      domains emerged: 1) Physical Functioning: fine motor and upper extremity, gross 
      motor and lower extremity, pain, skin symptoms, sleep and fatigue, and physical 
      resilience; 2) Psychological Functioning: cognitive, behavioral, emotional, 
      resilience, and body image; and 3) Family and Social Functioning: family 
      relationships, and parental satisfaction, school, peer relations, and community 
      participation. The framework will be used to develop item banks for a CAT-based 
      assessment of school-aged children's health and developmental outcomes, which 
      will be designed for clinical and research use to optimize interventions, 
      personalize care, and improve long-term health outcomes for burned children.

TI  - Time-Dependent Response of a Recycled C&D Material-Geotextile Interface under 
      Direct Shear Mode.

AB  - Geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures have been used extensively in recent 
      decades due to their significant advantages over more conventional earth 
      retaining structures, including the cost-effectiveness, reduced construction 
      time, and possibility of using locally-available lower quality soils and/or waste 
      materials, such as recycled construction and demolition (C&D) wastes. The 
      time-dependent shear behaviour at the interfaces between the geosynthetic and the 
      backfill is an important factor affecting the overall long-term performance of 
      such structures, and thereby should be properly understood. In this study, an 
      innovative multistage direct shear test procedure is introduced to characterise 
      the time-dependent response of the interface between a high-strength geotextile 
      and a recycled C&D material. After a prescribed shear displacement is reached, 
      the shear box is kept stationary for a specific period of time, after which the 
      test proceeds again, at a constant displacement rate, until the peak and 
      large-displacement shear strengths are mobilised. The shear stress-shear 
      displacement curves from the proposed multistage tests exhibited a progressive 
      decrease in shear stress with time (stress relaxation) during the period in which 
      the shear box was restrained from any movement, which was more pronounced under 
      lower normal stress values. Regardless of the prior interface shear displacement 
      and duration of the stress relaxation stage, the peak and residual shear strength 
      parameters of the C&D material-geotextile interface remained similar to those 
      obtained from the conventional (benchmark) tests carried out under constant 
      displacement rate.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS(R)) Pediatric Anger Scale in the Dutch general population.
PG  - 1261-1266
LID - 10.1037/pas0001051 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to validate the PROMIS(R) pediatric v2.0 Anger scale in the Dutch 
      general population, provide reference data, and compare reliability and relative 
      efficiency between the full-length scale, its short-form, computerized adaptive 
      test (CAT), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQLTM) emotional 
      functioning (EF) subscale scores. Children (N = 1,328), representative of the 
      Dutch population, were asked to complete the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale (8-18 
      years) and PedsQLTM (8-17 years). A graded response model (GRM) was fit to the 
      data. Structural validity was assessed by checking item-fit statistics (S-X2, p < 
      .001 = misfit). For construct validity, a moderate correlation (Pearson's r > 
      0.50) was expected between the Anger scale and PedsQLTM EF subscale score. Dutch 
      mean T score based on the U.S. model was calculated to provide reference data and 
      cut-offs. Standard error of measurement (SE(theta)) was used to assess reliability 
      (SE(theta) < .32 = .90 reliability). Relative efficiency was calculated (1 - SE(theta)2/N 
      items) to compare how good the measures performed relative to the amount of items 
      administered. In total, 527 children completed the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale, 
      of which 482 completed the PedsQLTM. Structural validity was sufficient as no 
      items displayed misfit (S-X2 = 22.9-40.3, p > .001). The Anger scale score 
      correlated moderately (Pearson's r = .64) with the PedsQLTM EF subscale score. 
      Dutch mean T score was 44.20 (SD = 11.39), with cut-offs of >52.2 for moderate 
      and >/=62.3 for severe symptoms. Reliable measurements were obtained at the 
      population mean and >2SD in the clinically relevant direction. CAT outperformed 
      all other measures in efficiency. The PROMIS pediatric Anger scale displayed 
      sufficient psychometric properties within the Dutch population and reference data 
      are available. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - A Brief Measure of Life Participation for People with COPD: Validation of the 
      Computer Adaptive Test Version of the Late Life Disability Instrument.
PG  - 385-392
LID - 10.1080/15412555.2021.1934821 [doi]
AB  - Computer-adaptive tests use respondents' answers to previous questions to select 
      the subsequent questions. They are gaining popularity for their increased 
      measurement precision and decreased administration time compared to static 
      questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to estimate the test-retest 
      reliability and construct validity of the computer-adaptive test version of a 
      participation measure, the Late Life Disability Instrument (LLDI-CAT) for people 
      with COPD and to compare scores and administration time with those of the static 
      LLDI. Among 76 older adults with COPD, scores on the LLDI-CAT were compared to 
      scores on measures of related constructs, between groups based on symptom 
      severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype, and to scores on the static LLDI. A 
      subsample of 28 people completed the LLDI-CAT a second time within one week of 
      the initial administration for test-retest reliability. The LLDI-CAT had very 
      good test-retest reliability (ICC(2,1) 0.88; SEM 2.74 points), fair correlations 
      with physical function (r = 0.37-0.50), anxiety (r=-0.42), and depression 
      (r=-0.50), fair to moderately-strong correlations with quality of life 
      (r = 0.48-0.63), and strong correlation with the static LLDI limitation domain 
      (r = 0.80). The LLDI-CAT scores differed between people with different symptom 
      severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype (p </= 0.004). The mean administration 
      time for the LLDI-CAT was 3.3 (1.5) minutes, less than that of the static LLDI at 
      6.3 (2.8) minutes (p < 0.001). The LLDI-CAT demonstrates evidence of test-retest 
      reliability and construct validity, and correlates well with the limitation 
      domain of the static LLDI for people with COPD. The LLDI-CAT can be used to 
      assess participation for this population.

TI  - Factors associated with pain intensity and magnitude of limitations among people 
      with hip and knee arthritis.
PG  - 295-300
LID - 10.1016/j.jor.2021.05.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis of the hip 
      and knee have a notable variation that does not correspond directly with 
      pathophysiology. The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of location 
      of the arthritis on pain intensity and magnitude of limitations accounting for 
      personal and psychological factors. METHODS: One hundred and fifty four patients 
      with osteoarthritis of the hip (41 patients) or the knee (113 patients) were 
      enrolled in this prospective cross sectional cohort study. Patients answered 
      questionnaires which included demographics, site of arthritis (hip or knee), 
      laterality (unilateral or bilateral), pain intensity, Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS 
      PF CAT), and psychologic questionnaires including the Tampa Scale of 
      Kinesiophobia (TSK-4), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4), Generalized Anxiety 
      Disorder (GAD-2) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      Depression Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS Dep CAT). Kellgren-Lawrence 
      classification was classified by the treating surgeon. Associations of these 
      factors with pain and function were assessed using bivariate and multivariable 
      regression models. RESULTS: In a multivariable model accounting for potential 
      confounding, magnitude of limitations was independently associated with years of 
      education, work status, time spent exercising, catastrophic thinking (PCS-4), and 
      symptoms of depression. They accounted for 50% of variability in physical 
      function, with the major contributor being catastrophic thinking. The model for 
      pain intensity included time spent exercising and fear of painful movement 
      (TSK-4). Anatomic site and radiographic severity of arthritis were not associated 
      with either physical function or pain in our patient sample. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study confirms that limitations and pain from osteoarthritis of the hip and knee 
      are more closely related to personal and psychological factors, less effective 
      cognitive coping strategies such as catastrophic thinking and kinesiophobia in 
      particular, than to pathological and anatomical factors such as location and 
      severity of arthritis. Care that incorporates incremental correction of common 
      misconceptions that accompany the nociception from osteoarthritis have the 
      potential to improve function and comfort in people with osteoarthritis. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

TI  - In Orthopaedic Speciality Care, Longer Explanations Are Not More Caring or More 
      Satisfying.
PG  - 2601-2607
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000001860 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research consistently documents no correlation between the duration 
      of a musculoskeletal specialty care visit and patient experience (perceived 
      empathy of the specialist and satisfaction with care). Based on a combination of 
      clinical experience and other lines of research, we speculate that longer visits 
      are often related to discordance between specialist and patient interpretation of 
      symptoms and weighting of available test and treatment options. If this is true, 
      then the specific duration of time discussing the specialist's interpretations 
      and options with the patient (expertise transfer) might correlate with 
      satisfaction with care and perceived empathy of the clinician even if the total 
      visit time does not. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What demographic or mental health 
      factors are associated with the duration of expertise transfer? (2) What factors, 
      including the duration of expertise transfer, are associated with the patient's 
      satisfaction with the visit and perceived clinician empathy? METHODS: In a 
      cross-sectional study, 128 new and returning English-speaking adult outpatients 
      seeking care from one of three orthopaedic specialists in two urban practices 
      between September and November 2019 were enrolled and agreed to audio recording 
      of the visit. A total of 92% (118) of patients completed the questionnaire and 
      had a usable recording. Participants completed a sociodemographic survey, the 
      Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System Depression computer adaptive 
      test (PROMIS Depression CAT; a measure of symptoms of depression), the Short 
      Health Anxiety Index (SHAI-5; a measure of symptoms of hypochondriasis, a form of 
      symptoms misinterpretation), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4; a measure of 
      misinterpretation of symptoms), an ordinal measure of patient satisfaction 
      (dichotomized into satisfied or not because of strong ceiling effects), and the 
      Jefferson Scale of Patient Perception of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE; a measure of 
      perceived clinician empathy). The duration of expertise transfer and the total 
      duration of the visit were measured by two raters with acceptable reliability 
      using software that facilitates segmentation of the visit audio recording. To 
      determine factors associated with the duration of expertise transfer, 
      satisfaction, and empathy, we planned a multivariable analysis controlling for 
      potential confounding variables identified in exploratory bivariable analysis. 
      However, there were insufficient associations to merit multivariable analysis. 
      RESULTS: A longer duration of expertise transfer had a modest correlation with 
      catastrophic thinking (r = 0.24; p = 0.01). Complete satisfaction with the visit 
      was associated with less health anxiety (6 [interquartile range 5 to 7] for 
      complete satisfaction versus 7 [5 to 7] for less than complete satisfaction; p = 
      0.02) and catastrophic thinking (4 [1 to 7] versus 5 [3 to 11]; p = 0.02), but 
      not with the duration of expertise transfer. Greater perceived clinician empathy 
      had a slight correlation with less health anxiety (r = -0.19; p = 0.04). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with greater misinterpretation of symptoms experience a 
      slightly less satisfying visit and less empathetic relationship with a 
      musculoskeletal specialist despite a longer duration of expertise transfer. This 
      supports the concept that directive strategies (such as teaching healthy 
      interpretation of symptoms) may be less effective then guiding strategies (such 
      as nurturing openness to alternative, healthier interpretation of symptoms using 
      motivational interviewing tactics, often over more than one visit or point of 
      contact). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many cognitive tests assess a limited developmental span, making 
      longitudinal measurement for trials aimed at improving cognition challenging. 
      Tests targeting transitional skills, which integrate foundational abilities into 
      complex schemas, may be amenable to assessment across a wide developmental span. 
      Furthermore, tablet-based tests permit computer adaptive testing (CAT), which is 
      psychometrically more efficient and could increase testing motivation, especially 
      for children with developmental delays. Such measures may be useful for research 
      and clinical practice. AIMS: Outline the creation of a novel, tablet-based 
      concept formation test, and evaluate its feasibility in individuals with mental 
      ages less than 24-months. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Item generation, user interface 
      construction, and pre-piloting were conducted in consultation with subject matter 
      experts. Item content and interface parameters underwent iterative revisions, 
      resulting in the pilot test. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: We created and piloted a 
      tablet-based test of concept formation suitable for CAT-based administration with 
      items of increasing difficulty based on target salience. We show feasibility in 
      individuals with mental ages less than 24-months-old. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Tablet-based assessment of concept formation may be a useful 
      outcome measure of an aspect of cognitive ability in young children. Future work 
      will address optimizing the user interface and developing CAT administration.

TI  - Patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures in interstitial 
      lung disease: where to go from here?
LID - 10.1183/16000617.0026-2021 [doi]
LID - 210026
AB  - Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), tools to assess patient self-report of 
      health status, are now increasingly used in research, care and policymaking. 
      While there are two well-developed disease-specific PROMs for interstitial lung 
      diseases (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), many unmet and urgent 
      needs remain. In December 2019, 64 international ILD experts convened in Erice, 
      Italy to deliberate on many topics, including PROMs in ILD. This review 
      summarises the history of PROMs in ILD, shortcomings of the existing tools, 
      challenges of development, validation and implementation of their use in clinical 
      trials, and the discussion held during the meeting. Development of 
      disease-specific PROMs for ILD including IPF with robust methodology and 
      validation in concordance with guidance from regulatory authorities have 
      increased user confidence in PROMs. Minimal clinically important difference for 
      bidirectional changes may need to be developed. Cross-cultural validation and 
      linguistic adaptations are necessary in addition to robust psychometric 
      properties for effective PROM use in multinational clinical trials. PROM burden 
      of use should be reduced through appropriate use of digital technologies and 
      computerised adaptive testing. Active patient engagement in all stages from 
      development, testing, choosing and implementation of PROMs can help improve 
      probability of success and further growth.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS((R)) pediatric item banks 
      Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in a general population.
PG  - 2683-2695
LID - 10.1007/s11136-021-02852-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to validate the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric item 
      banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a, and computerized 
      adaptive tests (CATs) in a general Dutch population and to provide reference 
      data. METHODS: Participants (N = 2,893, aged 8-18), recruited by two internet 
      survey providers, completed both item banks. These item banks were assessed on 
      unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity, Graded Response Model (GRM) 
      item fit, and differential item functioning (DIF) for gender, age group, region, 
      ethnicity, and language. The short forms and CATs were assessed on reliability 
      and construct validity compared to the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale 
      short version (RCADS-22) subscales. Reference scores were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Both item banks showed sufficient unidimensionality, local independence, 
      monotonicity, and GRM item fit, except for three Depressive Symptoms items that 
      showed insufficient GRM item fit. No DIF was found when using ordinal regression 
      analyses, except for two Depressive Symptoms items that showed DIF for language; 
      all items showed DIF for language when using IRT PRO, except for one Anxiety 
      item. Both short forms and CATs revealed sufficient reliability for moderate and 
      severe levels of anxiety and depression, as well as high positive correlations 
      with corresponding RCADS-22 subscales and slightly lower correlations with 
      non-corresponding RCADS-22 subscales. CONCLUSION: The Dutch-Flemish PROMIS 
      pediatric item banks v2.0 Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, the short forms 8a and 
      CATs are useful to assess and monitor anxiety and depression in a general 
      population. Reference data are presented.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite widely appreciated barriers to successful clinical 
      implementation, the literature regarding how to operationalize electronic health 
      record-integrated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) remains sparse. We offer a 
      detailed summary of the implementation of PROs into the standard of care at a 
      major tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: Collection of four 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests 
      was piloted in a large academic orthopaedic surgery ambulatory clinic starting in 
      October 2016. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      computer adaptive tests (Physical Function, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, 
      and Ability to Return to Social Roles and Activities) were initially implemented 
      as manual order sets to be administered before surgery through 2 years after 
      surgery. Completion rate over time, mean time to completion for all PRO domains, 
      and the overall distribution of symptom severity were used to evaluate the 
      success of the pilot. A subsequent optimization and redesign of the pilot was 
      conducted using tablets, automation of questionnaire deployment, and improved 
      results review to address obstacles encountered during the pilot phase. RESULTS: 
      Two thousand nine distinct joint arthroplasty patients (mean age = 65) completed 
      at least one set of PRO assessments, with overall completion rates reaching 68% 
      and mean completion time of 3 minutes. Focal points during the implementation 
      process included engagement and training of staff, selection of an appropriate 
      patient population and outcome measures, and user friendly data displays for 
      patients and providers. CONCLUSION: Our pilot program successfully demonstrated 
      that PROs can be administered, scored, and made immediately available within the 
      electronic health record to patients and their providers with minimal disruption 
      of clinical workflows. Although considerable operational and technological 
      challenges remain, we found that the implementation of PROs in clinical care 
      within an ambulatory practice at an academic medical center can be achieved 
      through a constellation of several key factors.

AB  - Underserved women of color experience high rates of perinatal affective 
      disorders, but most research to date on the natural history of these disorders 
      has been conducted on White women. The present study investigated longitudinal 
      changes in anxiety and depression in a sample of perinatal non-Hispanic Black and 
      Latina women. Categorical (yes/no) measures of positive anxiety and depression 
      screens, as well as total symptom scores, were measured longitudinally across the 
      perinatal period in 178 women (115 non-Hispanic Black, 63 Latina) using the 
      CAT-MH, a computerized adaptive test. Time (up to 4 visits) and race/ethnicity 
      effects were assessed in linear mixed effects models. Rates of positive anxiety 
      screenings were 13.6%, 3.2%, 8.5%, and 0% in Latina women and 2.6%, 4.2%, 6.1%, 
      and 5.8% in non-Hispanic Black women in the 1(st), 2(nd), and 3(rd) trimesters, 
      and postpartum, respectively. Rates of positive anxiety screenings overall were 
      highest in the first trimester (OR = 0.20; 95% CI 0.04-0.98), and there was a 
      significant time-by-race/ethnicity interaction for positive anxiety screens 
      (OR = 8.88; 95% CI 1.42-55.51), as positive screens were most frequent in the 
      first trimester and sharply declined for Latina women, while rates were 
      relatively consistent across the perinatal period in non-Hispanic Black women. 
      Rates of positive depression screens did not change over time, but there was a 
      trend (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 0.93-4.03) for a time-by-race/ethnicity interaction in a 
      direction similar to that seen for anxiety. The odds of positive anxiety screens 
      vary by race/ethnicity and trimester, suggesting that anxiety screening and 
      anxiety interventions may be most resourcefully used in the first trimester for 
      Latina women in particular.

PG  - 259-267
LID - 10.1177/15394492211012657 [doi]
AB  - The Infant Toddler Activity Card Sort (ITACS) is a new measure that engages 
      caregivers in goal development by measuring participation in early childhood. 
      Initial evaluation of the ITACS is required to assess its psychometric 
      properties. To evaluate test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and 
      between-group differences of the ITACS. Caregivers (N = 208) of children 0-3 
      years, who were typically developing (TD) or had a developmental delay (DD), 
      completed the ITACS and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer 
      Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) with repeat assessment after 2 weeks later (n = 117). 
      The ITACS demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with the PEDI-CAT. Children 
      with DD had significantly more activity concerns on the ITACS than TD. Adequate 
      test-retest reliability was not achieved. The ITACS is a useful tool for 
      identifying caregiver concerns in activity engagement; interventions can be 
      tailored to address concerns and increase participation in childhood routines.

TI  - Customizing CAT Administration of the PROMIS Misuse of Prescription Pain 
      Medication Item Bank for Patients with Chronic Pain.
PG  - 1669-1675
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnab159 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The 22-item PROMIS(R)-Rx Pain Medication Misuse item bank (Bank-22) 
      imposes a high response burden. This study aimed to characterize the performance 
      of the Bank-22 in a computer adaptive testing (CAT) setting based on varied 
      stopping rules. METHODS: The 22 items were administered to 288 patients. We 
      performed a CAT simulation using default stopping rules (CATPROMIS). In 5 other 
      simulations, a "best health" response rule was added to decrease response burden. 
      This rule stopped CAT administration when a participant selected "never" to a 
      specified number of initial Bank-22 items (2-6 in this study, designated 
      CATAlt2-Alt6). The Bank-22 and 7-item short form (SF-7) scores were compared to 
      scores based on CATPROMIS, and the 5 CAT variations. RESULTS: Bank-22 scores 
      correlated highly with the SF-7 and CATPROMIS, Alt5, Alt6 scores (r=0.87-0.95) 
      and moderately with CATAlt2- Alt4 scores (r=0.63-0.74). In all CAT conditions, 
      the greatest differences with Bank-22 scores were at the lower end of misuse 
      T-scores. The smallest differences with Bank-22 and CATPROMIS scores were 
      observed with CATAlt5 and CATAlt6. Compared to the SF-7, CATAlt5 and CATAlt6 
      reduced overall response burden by about 42%. Finally, the correlations between 
      PROMIS-Rx Misuse and Anxiety T-scores remained relatively unchanged across the 
      conditions (r=0.31-0.43, Ps < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Applying a stopping rule based 
      on number of initial "best health" responses reduced response burden for 
      respondents with lower levels of misuse. The tradeoff was less measurement 
      precision for those individuals, which could be an acceptable tradeoff when the 
      chief concern is in discriminating higher levels of misuse.

TI  - The Effects of Virtual Reality Based Rehabilitation on Upper Extremity Function 
      in a Child with Cerebral Palsy: A Case Report.
PG  - 620-636
LID - 10.1080/01942638.2021.1909688 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This case report was designed to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) 
      rehabilitation on improving upper extremity function for a child with spastic 
      hemiplegic cerebral palsy. METHODS: In addition to conventional therapies 
      completed three times per week, the participant engaged in virtual reality 
      rehabilitation with the Neofect Smart Kids five to seven days per week for six 
      weeks totaling just over twelve hours of intervention time. Outcome measures were 
      administered pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6-weeks post-intervention. 
      RESULTS: Varying levels of improvement in motor function, quality of movement, 
      and functional use were observed during intervention evidenced by improved scores 
      on the following standardized assessments: Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, 
      Second Edition; the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test; and the Pediatric 
      Evaluation and Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test. The participant 
      maintained improvements in motor skills at 6-weeks post intervention, however, 
      the quality of his movements and overall frequency of use with his affected upper 
      extremity decreased in the 6-weeks following termination of intervention. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Even though the results are not generalizable, the VR intervention 
      for this child allowed for greater movement repetition and improved functional 
      upper extremity use.

      Survivors of Pediatric Critical Illness.
PG  - 1547-1557
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000004970 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe functional and skeletal muscle changes observed during 
      pediatric critical illness and recovery and their association with health-related 
      quality of life. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single 
      multidisciplinary PICU. PATIENTS: Children with greater than or equal to 1 organ 
      dysfunction, expected PICU stay greater than or equal to 48 hours, expected 
      survival to discharge, and without progressive neuromuscular disease or 
      malignancies were followed from admission to approximately 6.7 months 
      postdischarge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional 
      status was measured using the Functional Status Scale score and Pediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test. Patient and parental 
      health-related quality of life were measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life 
      Inventory and Short Form-36 questionnaires, respectively. Quadriceps muscle size, 
      echogenicity, and fat thickness were measured using ultrasonography during PICU 
      stay, at hospital discharge, and follow-up. Factors affecting change in muscle 
      were explored. Associations between functional, muscle, and health-related 
      quality of life changes were compared using regression analysis. Seventy-three 
      survivors were recruited, of which 44 completed follow-ups. Functional impairment 
      persisted in four of 44 (9.1%) at 6.7 months (interquartile range, 6-7.7 mo) 
      after discharge. Muscle size decreased during PICU stay and was associated with 
      inadequate energy intake (adjusted beta, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.28; p = 0.030). No 
      change in echogenicity or fat thickness was observed. Muscle growth postdischarge 
      correlated with mobility function scores (adjusted beta, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09; p 
      = 0.046). Improvements in mobility scores were associated with improved physical 
      health-related quality of life at follow-up (adjusted beta, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.23-1.81; 
      p = 0.013). Child physical health-related quality of life at hospital discharge 
      was associated with parental physical health-related quality of life (adjusted beta, 
      0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.17; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle decreased in critically 
      ill children, which was associated with energy inadequacy and impaired muscle 
      growth postdischarge. Muscle changes correlated with change in mobility, which 
      was associated with child health-related quality of life. Mobility, child 
      health-related quality of life, and parental health-related quality of life 
      appeared to be interlinked.

TI  - Predicting suicidality using a computer adaptive test: Two longitudinal studies 
      of sexual and gender minority youth.
PG  - 166-175
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000531 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Over the past decade, rates of death by suicide have increased among 
      youth. Efficient and effective screening approaches are needed for suicide 
      prevention. Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience profound 
      disparities, but little is known about subgroups and risk assessments need to be 
      validated. This study tested the psychometric properties and predictive value of 
      a highly efficient computerized adaptive test for suicide risk (CAT-SS) among 
      SGMY. METHODS: Participants in two cohort studies of SGMY completed the CAT-SS 
      and validated measures of suicidality in 2018 (n = 1,073) and at their follow-up 
      visit 6 months later (n = 936). Tests of psychometrics and predictive validity 
      were performed. RESULTS: Younger, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual (e.g., 
      bisexual; relative to monosexual), and gender nonconforming or nongender binary 
      (relative to cisgender and transgender) participants had significantly higher 
      CAT-SS scores. None of the CAT-SS items met the threshold for differential item 
      functioning. In longitudinal analyses, prediction of suicidality moved from poor 
      to good accuracy once CAT-SS was included in the model. CAT-SS significantly 
      improved prediction of suicidality over-and-above reported suicidality at a prior 
      wave. CONCLUSIONS: The current study validated CAT-SS as a brief predictor of 
      suicide risk in the disproportionately affected population of SGMY. Screening of 
      SGMY in clinical and community settings using CAT-SS could allow for the 
      identification of participants that need services to reduce their risk of future 
      suicide. Results support the need for particular attention to suicide prevention 
      among SGMY who are teenagers, assigned female at birth, nonmonosexual, and gender 
      nonconforming or nongender binary. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all

AB  - The increasing use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures is forcing 
      clinicians and health care systems to decide which to select and how to 
      incorporate them into their records and clinical workflows. This overview 
      addresses 3 topics related to these concerns. First, a literature review 
      summarizes key psychometric and practical factors (such as reliability, 
      responsiveness, computer adaptive testing, and interpretability) in choosing PROs 
      for clinical practice. Second, 3 clinical decision support issues are 
      highlighted: gathering PROs, electronic health record effect on providers, and 
      incorporating PROs into clinical decision support design and implementation. 
      Lastly, the salience of crosscutting domains as well as 9 key pragmatic decisions 
      are reviewed. Crosscutting domains are those that are relevant across most 
      medical and mental health conditions, such as the SPADE symptom pentad (sleep 
      problems, pain, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue) and physical 
      functioning. The 9 pragmatic decisions include (1) generic vs disease-specific 
      scales; (2) single- vs multidomain scales; (3) universal scales vs user-choice 
      selection; (4) number of domains to measure; (5) prioritization of domains when 
      multiple domains are assessed; (6) action thresholds; (7) clinical purpose 
      (screening vs monitoring); as well as the (8) frequency and (9) logistical 
      aspects of PRO administration.

TI  - Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measures 
      PRO-CTCAE and CAT EORTC QLQ-C30 in Major Abdominal Cancer Surgery (PATRONUS): A 
      Student-Initiated German Medical Audit (SIGMA) Study.
PG  - 3075-3089
LID - 10.1245/s10434-021-09646-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) version of the Common Terminology 
      Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) and the computerized adaptive testing 
      (CAT) version of the EORTC quality-of-life questionnaire QLQ-C30 have been 
      proposed as new PRO measures in oncology; however, their implementation in 
      patients undergoing cancer surgery has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: Patients 
      undergoing elective abdominal cancer surgery were enrolled in a prospective 
      multicenter study, and postoperative complications were recorded according to the 
      Dindo-Clavien classification. Patients reported PRO data using the CAT EORTC 
      QLQ-C30 and the PRO-CTCAE to measure 12 core cancer symptoms. Patients were 
      followed-up for 6 months postoperatively. The study was carried out by medical 
      students of the CHIR-Net SIGMA study network. RESULTS: Data of 303 patients were 
      obtained and analyzed across 15 sites. PRO-CTCAE symptoms 'poor appetite', 
      'fatigue', 'exhaustion' and 'sleeping problems' increased after surgery and 
      climaxed 10-30 days postoperatively. At 3-6 months postoperatively, no PRO-CTCAE 
      symptom differed significantly to baseline. Patients reported higher 'social 
      functioning' (p = 0.021) and overall quality-of-life scores (p < 0.05) 6 months 
      after cancer surgery compared with the baseline level. There was a lack of 
      correlation between postoperative complications or death and any of the PRO items 
      evaluated. Feasibility endpoints for student-led research were met. CONCLUSION: 
      The two novel PRO questionnaires were successfully applied in surgical oncology. 
      Postoperative complications do not affect health-reported quality-of-life or 
      common cancer symptoms following major cancer surgery. The feasibility of 
      student-led multicenter clinical research was demonstrated, but might be enhanced 
      by improved student training.

      Information System Scores Predict Which Patients Will Benefit From Arthroscopic

AB  - Despite its widespread use and low complication rates, arthroscopic meniscectomy 
      has not been uniformly successful in all patients, especially in those with 
      concurrent osteoarthritis. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) is an initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health to 
      develop and validate patient-reported outcomes for clinical research and 
      practice. PROMIS has shown the ability to enhance and standardize measurement of 
      a variety of health domains affecting musculoskeletal function and in 
      discriminating between various orthopaedic procedures through the use of computer 
      adaptive testing. Preoperative PROMIS scores are valid predictors of 
      postoperative minimal clinically important difference in patients undergoing 
      arthroscopic meniscectomy based on preoperative decreased physical function and 
      increased pain interference. PROMIS score cutoffs may be used by arthroscopic 
      surgeons to counsel patients considering arthroscopic meniscectomy.

TI  - Item banks for measurement of refractive error-specific quality of life.
PG  - 591-602
LID - 10.1111/opo.12792 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of refractive error-specific 
      quality of life (QoL) item banks and assess their performance using computerised 
      adaptive testing (CAT) simulations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study a 
      392-item questionnaire, grouped under 11 QoL domains, was 
      interviewer-administered to 305 people with refractive error [mean age +/- S.D., 
      30.5 +/- 14.1 (range (18 to 83) years; male, 50.5%; mean +/- S.D. spherical 
      equivalent refractive error -2.4 +/- 2.9 (range: -15.0 to +11.0) Dioptres; 
      spectacles (n = 257), contact lens (n = 37), refractive surgery (n = 25), 
      uncorrected refractive error (n = 57)]. Rasch analysis was conducted on each QoL 
      domain using the Andrich rating scale model to investigate parameters including 
      response category functioning, person- and item-reliability, infit and outfit 
      statistics, unidimensionality, targeting, differential item functioning and local 
      item dependency. The resulting item banks underwent CAT simulations in 1,000 
      cases with 'high' and 'moderate' precision stopping rules. RESULTS: Rasch 
      analysis iterations resulted in 13 refractive error-specific item banks 
      (Convenience, Health concerns, Economic, Activity limitation, Mobility, 
      Emotional, Social, Visual symptoms frequency, Visual symptoms severity, Visual 
      symptoms bothersome, Comfort symptoms frequency, Comfort symptoms severity and 
      Comfort symptoms bothersome), containing a total of 366 items. The item banks had 
      good psychometric properties including satisfactory measurement precision, infit 
      and outfit statistics and unidimensionality. In CAT simulations, the mean number 
      of items required to achieve high and moderate measurement precision was 9.4 and 
      4.7, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, refractive error-specific QoL item banks 
      show promise in their ability to comprehensively and precisely evaluate a range 
      of quality of life parameters. These items banks when administered using a CAT 
      system offer unique outcome tools for implementation in clinical trials, 
      healthcare and research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated the National Institutes of Health 
      (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to be a 
      responsive and efficient measure for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. 
      While these studies were rigorous in their protocol and methodology, no efforts 
      in recent literature have been made to identify if these reference scores apply 
      to elite athletes. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine 
      whether there is a difference in the baseline scores of elite athletes versus the 
      general population. We hypothesized that athletes' PROMIS upper extremity general 
      function (PROMIS-UE) and general physical function (PROMIS-PF) scores would vary 
      substantially from the mean health state of the general population. We further 
      hypothesized that these scores would be affected by specific sport and level of 
      competition. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: 
      Three PROMIS computer adaptive test (CAT) domains were administered to elite 
      athlete (>/=18 years) volunteers (either in person or through email). An elite 
      athlete was defined as one participating in sports at the collegiate level or 
      higher. Test domains included PROMIS-PF, PROMIS-UE, and pain interference 
      (PROMIS-PI). PROMIS domain t scores were defined and assessed against NIH 
      reference values to identify significant differences. Distribution analysis was 
      conducted using histograms and normality assessments. Domains were also subject 
      to correlation analysis. Finally, subgroup analysis was conducted for all athlete 
      characteristics to identify any factors associated with variance. RESULTS: In 
      total, 196 elite athletes (mean age, 21.1 years; range, 18.0-36.7 years) 
      completed all 3 PROMIS-CAT forms. Overall, the mean scores were 56.0 +/- 6.4, 58.1 
      +/- 7.7, and 47.1 +/- 7.3 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and PROMIS-PI, respectively. 
      Distribution analysis showed nonnormal distribution for all 3 PROMIS domains 
      (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P < .001). Similarly, in all 3 PROMIS domains the 
      athletes displayed more disparate scores than the NIH-reported reference values 
      (1-way sign test, P < .001). Only the presence of pain and sport played showed 
      association with variance in PROMIS domain scores (P < .001 and P = .003, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Elite athletes displayed more disparate reference 
      scores than the NIH-reported average of 50 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and 
      PROMIS-PI. Furthermore, these forms were sensitive to varying levels of sport 
      among collegiate athletes.

AB  - AIMS: The increase in prescription opioid misuse and dependence is now a public 
      health crisis in the UK. It is recognized as a whole-person problem that involves 
      both the medical and the psychosocial needs of patients. Analyzing aspects of 
      pathophysiology, emotional health, and social wellbeing associated with 
      persistent opioid use after injury may inform safe and effective alleviation of 
      pain while minimizing risk of misuse or dependence. Our objectives were to 
      investigate patient factors associated with opioid use two to four weeks and six 
      to nine months after an upper limb fracture. METHODS: A total of 734 patients 
      recovering from an isolated upper limb fracture were recruited in this study. 
      Opioid prescription was documented retrospectively for the period preceding the 
      injury, and prospectively at the two- to four-week post-injury visit and six- to 
      nine-month post-injury visit. Bivariate and multivariate analysis sought factors 
      associated with opioid prescription from demographics, injury-specific data, 
      Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Instrumentation System (PROMIS), Depression 
      computer adaptive test (CAT), PROMIS Anxiety CAT, PROMIS Instrumental Support 
      CAT, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire 
      (PSEQ-2), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11), and measures that investigate 
      levels of social support. RESULTS: A new prescription of opioids two to four 
      weeks after injury was independently associated with less social support (odds 
      ratio (OR) 0.26, p < 0.001), less instrumental support (OR 0.91, p < 0.001), and 
      greater symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.1, p < 0.001). A new prescription of opioids 
      six to nine months after injury was independently associated with less 
      instrumental support (OR 0.9, p < 0.001) and greater symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.1, 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that potentially modifiable 
      psychosocial factors are associated with increased acute and chronic opioid 
      prescriptions following upper limb fracture. Surgeons prescribing opioids for 
      upper limb fractures should be made aware of the screening and management of 
      emotional and social health. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(2):119-124.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe relationships between 
      negative emotions and perceived emotional support in parents of children admitted 
      to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      descriptive study conducted face-to-face interviews between January 2019 and 
      January 2020. Study variables included depression (PHQ-9 Scale), anxiety 
      (Emotional Distress-Anxiety-Short Form 8a), anger (Emotional Distress-Anger-Short 
      Form 5a), fear (Fear-Affect Computerized Adaptive Test), somatic fear 
      (Fear-Somatic Arousal-Fixed Form), loneliness (Revised 20-item UCLA Loneliness 
      Scale), and perceived emotional support (Emotional Support-Fixed Form). RESULTS: 
      Eighty parents reported symptoms of depression 8.00(4.00, 13.75), anxiety 
      (23.43 +/- 7.80), anger (13.40 +/- 5.46), fear (72.81 +/- 27.26), somatic fear 
      9.00(6.00, 12.75), loneliness (39.35 +/- 12.00), and low perceived emotional 
      support (32.14 +/- 8.06). Parents who were young, single, low-income, and with 
      limited-post secondary education reported greater loneliness and lower perceived 
      emotional support. Fear correlated with depression (r = 0.737, P < 0.01) and 
      anxiety (r=0.900, P < 0.01). Inverse relationships were discovered between 
      perceived emotional support and loneliness (r = -0.767, P < 0.01), anger 
      (r=-0.401, P < 0.01), and depression (r = -0.334, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      cluster of negative emotions identified will serve as potential targets for 
      future interventions designed to enhance support for parents of critically ill 
      children.

AB  - Although knee and hip replacements are intended to relieve pain and improve 
      function, up to 44% of knee replacement patients and 27% of hip replacement 
      patients report persistent postoperative joint pain. Improving surgical pain 
      management is essential. We conducted a single-site, 3-arm, parallel-group 
      randomized clinical trial conducted at an orthopedic clinic, among patients 
      undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) of the hip or knee. Mindfulness 
      meditation (MM), hypnotic suggestion (HS), and cognitive-behavioral pain 
      psychoeducation (cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation) were each delivered 
      in a single, 15-minute group session as part of a 2-hour, preoperative education 
      program. Preoperative outcomes-pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, pain 
      medication desire, and anxiety-were measured with numeric rating scales. 
      Postoperative physical functioning at 6-week follow-up was assessed with the 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function 
      computer adaptive test. Total joint arthroplasty patients were randomized to 
      preoperative MM, HS, or cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (n = 285). 
      Mindfulness meditation and HS led to significantly less preoperative pain 
      intensity, pain unpleasantness, and anxiety. Mindfulness meditation also 
      decreased preoperative pain medication desire relative to cognitive-behavioral 
      pain psychoeducation and increased postoperative physical functioning at 6-week 
      follow-up relative to HS and cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation. 
      Moderation analysis revealed the surgery type did not differentially impact the 3 
      interventions. Thus, a single session of a simple, scripted MM intervention may 
      be able to immediately decrease TJA patients' preoperative clinical symptomology 
      and improve postoperative physical function. As such, embedding brief MM 
      interventions in surgical care pathways has the potential to improve surgical 
      outcomes for the millions of patients receiving TJA each year.

AB  - PURPOSE: To calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of the 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity 
      Computer Adaptive Test (UE CAT) and Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and 
      Hand (QuickDASH) for ligament reconstruction tendon interposition (LRTI) 
      patients. METHODS: Adult patients treated with LRTI for trapeziometacarpal OA by 
      fellowship-trained hand surgeons between December 2014 and February 2018 at an 
      academic tertiary institution were included. Outcomes were prospectively 
      collected at each visit by tablet computer, including the QuickDASH, PROMIS UE, 
      Pain Interference, Depression, and Anxiety CATs. Inclusion required a response to 
      the anchor question "How much relief and/or improvement do you feel you have 
      experienced as a result of your treatment?" on a 6-option Likert scale, as well 
      as preoperative (</=120 days before surgery) and follow-up (2-26 weeks) outcomes. 
      We calculated MCID both by an anchor-based approach using the mean score of the 
      minimal change group, and with the 0.5 SD method. RESULTS: Of 145 included 
      participants, mean age was 63 +/- 8 years and 74% were female. Anchor-based MCID 
      estimates for the total cohort were 4.2 for the PROMIS UE CAT and 8.8 for the 
      QuickDASH. The MCID estimates using the 0.5 SD method were 4.8 and 11.7, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We propose MCID values of 4.2 to 4.8 for the PROMIS UE 
      CAT and 8.8 to 11.7 for the QuickDASH when powering clinical studies or when 
      assessing improvement among a cohort of patients who have undergone LRTI surgery. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Minimal clinically important difference estimates are helpful 
      when interpreting clinical outcomes after LRTI and for powering prospective 
      trials.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The most frequently used measures of facial emotion recognition (FER) 
      are insufficiently comprehensive, reliable, valid, and efficient; moreover, the 
      impact of gender on scoring has not been controlled. OBJECTIVE: To develop a 
      computerized adaptive test of FER for adults with schizophrenia. DESIGN: First, 
      we selected photographs from a published database. Second, items that fitted well 
      to a Rasch model were used to form the item bank. Third and last, we determined 
      the best administration mode for prospective users to achieve both high 
      reliability and efficiency. SETTING: Psychiatric hospitals and the community. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Adults living with schizophrenia (n = 351) and adults without 
      diagnosed mental illness (n = 101). RESULTS: After removal of misfit items (infit 
      or outfit >/=1.4), the remaining 165 items were selected to form an item bank. 
      Among them, 39 showed severe gender bias, so the item difficulties were adjusted 
      accordingly. On the basis of the item bank, two administration modes were 
      recommended for prospective users. The reliable mode required approximately 128 
      items (nearly 20 min) to achieve reliability (.72-.81), similar to that of the 
      entire item bank. The efficient mode required approximately 73 items (approximate 
      11 min) to provide acceptable reliability (.69-.73) for the seven domain scores. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our newly developed measure provides comprehensive, 
      valid, and unbiased (to examinees' gender) assessments of FER in adults living 
      with schizophrenia. In addition, the administration modes can be flexibly changed 
      to optimize the reliability or efficiency for prospective users. WHAT THIS 
      ARTICLE ADDS: This newly developed FER measure can help occupational therapists 
      identify deficits in recognizing specific basic emotions and plan corresponding 
      interventions to manage the impact on their clients' social functions.

TI  - Optimising the computerised adaptive test to reliably reduce the burden of 
      administering the CLEFT-Q: A Monte Carlo simulation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computerised adaptive testing (CAT) has the potential to transform 
      plastic surgery outcome measurement by making patient-reported outcome measures 
      (PROMs) shorter, individualised and more accurate than pen-and-paper 
      questionnaires. OBJECTIVES: This paper reports the results of two optimisation 
      studies for the CLEFT-Q CAT, a CAT intended for use in the field of cleft lip 
      and/or palate. Specifically, we aimed to identify the optimal score estimation 
      and item selection methods for using this CAT in clinical practice. These 
      represent two major components of any CAT algorithm. METHOD: Monte Carlo 
      simulations were performed using simulated data in the R statistical computing 
      environment and incorporated a range of score estimation and item selection 
      techniques. The performance and accuracy of the CAT was assessed by mean items 
      administered, correlation between CAT scores and paired linear assessment scores, 
      and the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of these score pairs. RESULTS: The 
      accuracy of the CLEFT-Q CAT was not significantly affected by the choice of score 
      estimation or item selection method. Sub-scales which originally contain more 
      items were amenable to greater item reduction with CAT. CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that score estimation and item selection methods that need minimal 
      processing power can be used in the CLEFT-Q CAT without compromising accuracy. 
      This means that the CLEFT-Q CAT could be administered quickly and efficiently 
      with basic hardware demands. We recommend the use of less computationally 
      intensive techniques in future CLEFT-Q CAT studies.

LID - 10.1080/09286586.2020.1856385 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This exploratory qualitative research was conducted to understand the 
      quality of life (QoL) impacts of adult uveitis to develop a uveitis QoL item 
      bank, and we present here the results of qualitative analysis of uveitis patient 
      experience.METHODS: A qualitative approach with phenomenological study design was 
      employed to explore the common QoL domains in uveitis. Data were collected using 
      focus groups and face-to-face interviews. The sessions were audio-recorded, 
      transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically. NViVo software was used to 
      perform qualitative analysis.RESULTS: Eight focus groups and 10 interviews were 
      conducted with 41 patients with uveitis. Seven QoL domains were identified, 
      namely symptoms, emotional, activity limitation, health concerns, convenience, 
      social, and economic impact. Although these QoL domains have been previously 
      identified in other eye diseases, the sub-themes within each QoL domain were 
      unique to uveitis. Participants described a variety of symptoms including 
      increased light sensitivity, blurred vision, pain, redness, and tearing. 
      Participants repeatedly described feeling frustrated due to prognostic 
      uncertainty and associated discomfort. Participants were concerned about the 
      frequent relapses of inflammation, as well as side-effects from long-term 
      systemic medications. Uveitis affected their ability to perform daily tasks such 
      as using computers, driving, and reading books. Direct financial impacts included 
      reduced work hours and the costs of treatment and specialist care.CONCLUSION: 
      Participants with uveitis experience many symptoms in addition to 
      medication-related inconveniences and activity limitations. The QoL issues 
      identified will be used to develop a uveitis-specific QoL item bank.

AB  - Calibration errors are inevitable and should not be ignored during the estimation 
      of item parameters. Items with calibration error can affect the measurement 
      results of tests. One of the purposes of the current study is to investigate the 
      impacts of the calibration errors during the estimation of item parameters on the 
      measurement accuracy, average test length, and test efficiency for 
      variable-length cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing. The other 
      purpose is to examine the methods for reducing the adverse effects of calibration 
      errors. Simulation results show that (1) calibration error has negative effect on 
      the measurement accuracy for the deterministic input, noisy "and" gate (DINA) 
      model, and the reduced reparameterized unified model; (2) the average test 
      lengths is shorter, and the test efficiency is overestimated for items with 
      calibration errors; (3) the compensatory reparameterized unified model (CRUM) is 
      less affected by the calibration errors, and the classification accuracy, average 
      test length, and test efficiency are slightly stable in the CRUM framework; (4) 
      methods such as improving the quality of items, using large calibration sample to 
      calibrate the parameters of items, as well as using cross-validation method can 
      reduce the adverse effects of calibration errors on CD-CAT.

AB  - Emotion regulation (ER) plays a vital role in individuals' well-being and 
      successful functioning. In this study, we attempted to develop a computerized 
      adaptive testing (CAT) to efficiently evaluate ER, namely the CAT-ER. The initial 
      CAT-ER item bank comprised 154 items from six commonly used ER scales, which were 
      completed by 887 participants recruited in China. We conducted unidimensionality 
      testing, item response theory (IRT) model comparison and selection, and IRT item 
      analysis including local independence, item fit, differential item functioning, 
      and item discrimination. Sixty-three items with good psychometric properties were 
      retained in the final CAT-ER. Then, two CAT simulation studies were implemented 
      to assess the CAT-ER, which revealed that the CAT-ER developed in this study 
      performed reasonably well, considering that it greatly lessened the test items 
      and time without losing measurement accuracy.

      surgery.
PG  - 579-583
LID - 10.1016/j.jor.2020.11.009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the increasing incidence of orthopaedic surgeries, there is 
      a lack of data reporting on patient experience and recovery following surgery. As 
      such, there is a need to better characterize the natural history of pain 
      interference (PI) after orthopaedic surgery to better manage patients' 
      expectations and recovery. PURPOSE: To identify factors associated with greater 
      pain interference two weeks following orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: All patients 
      undergoing elective outpatient orthopaedic surgery at a single urban academic 
      institution were evaluated preoperatively from August 2016 to March 2018. 
      Patients completed a baseline assessment consisting of demographic information, 
      PROMIS computer adaptive testing in 6 domains including Pain Interference (PI), 
      Physical Function, Social Satisfaction, Fatigue, Anxiety, and Depression. Two 
      weeks following surgery, patients completed the same questionnaires along with 
      assessments of Improvement and Satisfaction. Bivariate and multivariable 
      regression analyses were performed. Categorical data was compared with ANOVA and 
      continuous data was compared with Spearman's correlation coefficient (r(s)). 
      RESULTS: 435 patients (age = 41.1 +/- 15.7, 47% female) were studied. Mean PI was 
      60.1 +/- 7.0 prior to surgery and 61.7 +/- 7.6 at 2 weeks postoperative. Worse 2 week 
      PROMIS PI was associated with lower extremity surgery, prior surgery on the 
      joint, preoperative opioid use, depression, lower income, lower education, and 
      higher ASA score (p < 0.05). Better 2 week PROMIS PI was correlated with better 
      baseline and better 2 week scores on all outcome measures. Multivariable analysis 
      demonstrated that lower extremity surgery, worse preoperative pain scores, and 
      worse preoperative pain interference were independent predictors of worse pain 
      interference after surgery. CONCLUSION: Early postoperative pain interference is 
      associated with function, demographic, and psychosocial factors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our primary purpose was to evaluate the reliability of telephone 
      administration of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) Upper Extremity (UE) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) version 2.0 in a hand 
      and upper extremity population, and secondarily to make comparisons with the 
      abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand 
      (QuickDASH). METHODS: Patients more than 1 year out from hand surgeries performed 
      at a single tertiary institution were enrolled. Half of the patients completed 
      telephone PROMIS UE CAT and QuickDASH surveys first, followed by computer-based 
      surveys 1 to 10 days later, and the other half completed them in the reverse 
      order. Telephone surveys were readministered 2 to 6 weeks later to evaluate 
      test-retest reliability. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) were used to 
      assess agreement between telephone and computer-based scores, and intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability. The 
      proportion of patients with discrepancies in follow-up scores that exceeded 
      estimates of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was evaluated. 
      RESULTS: For the 89 enrolled patients, the PROMIS UE CAT CCC was 0.82 (83% 
      confidence interval [83% CI], 0.77-0.86; good), which was significantly lower 
      than 0.92 (83% CI, 0.89-0.94; good to excellent) for the QuickDASH. The PROMIS UE 
      CAT ICC did not differ significantly from the QuickDASH (0.85 and 0.91, 
      respectively). Differences in telephone versus computer scores exceeded 5 points 
      (MCID estimate) for the PROMIS UE CAT in 34% of patients versus 5% of patients 
      exceeding 14 points (MCID estimate) for the QuickDASH. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly 
      better reliability was observed for the QuickDASH than the PROMIS UE CAT when 
      comparing telephone with computer-based score acquisition. Over one-third of 
      patients demonstrated a clinically relevant difference in scores between the 
      telephone and the computer-administered tests. We conclude that the PROMIS UE CAT 
      should only be administered through computer-based methods. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      These findings suggest that differences in collection methods for the PROMIS UE 
      CAT may systematically affect the scores obtained, which may erroneously 
      influence the interpretation of postoperative scores for hand surgery patients.

TI  - Difficult life events affect lower extremity illness.
PG  - 599-605
LID - 10.1007/s00402-020-03686-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the relationship between psychological distress and activity 
      tolerance (capability), a stressful life event might diminish accommodation, 
      increase symptoms, and induce a person to seek specialty care. As a first step to 
      investigate this possibility, this study addressed whether difficult life events 
      are associated with greater activity intolerance and pain intensity. METHODS: A 
      cohort of 127 patients seeking specialty care for lower extremity symptoms 
      completed questionnaires that inquired about difficult life events within the 
      last 12 months as derived from the Holmes Rahe Life Stress Inventory, and 
      recorded pain intensity on an 11-point ordinal scale, activity tolerance [Patient 
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer 
      Adaptive Test (CAT)], symptoms of anxiety (GAD-2; 2 item version of the 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), symptoms of depression (PROMIS 
      Depression CAT), self-efficacy when in pain (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, 2 
      question version), and demographics. The treating clinician indicated if the 
      disease was established (e.g. arthritis) or relatively new (e.g. sprain/strain). 
      Bivariate and multivariable analyses sought factors associated with activity 
      intolerance and pain intensity. RESULTS: Greater activity intolerance was 
      associated with difficult life events in bivariate analyses (t = 2.13, MD = 3.18, 
      95% C.I. = 0.22-6.13, p = 0.04) and in multivariable analyses that excluded 
      symptoms of depression. Greater pain intensity was not associated with difficult 
      life events, but was associated with surgeon rating of established disease 
      (beta = 1.20, 95% C.I. = 0.33-2.08, p < 0.01), greater symptoms of anxiety 
      (MD = 3.35, s = 1.72; rho = 0.30, p < 0.01), and less education (beta =  - 1.06, 95% 
      C.I. =  - 1.94- - 0.18, p = 0.02) (no college degree). CONCLUSION: When a 
      musculoskeletal specialist identifies less activity tolerance (less capability) 
      than anticipated for a given injury or pathology, they can anticipate a potential 
      difficult life event, and expect alleviation of symptoms and improved capability 
      as the stress is ameliorated with time and support. Specialists can be prepared 
      to direct people to community or professional support if requested.

TI  - Speeding up Monte Carlo simulations for the adaptive sum of powered score test 
      with importance sampling.
PG  - 261-273
LID - 10.1111/biom.13407 [doi]
AB  - A central but challenging problem in genetic studies is to test for (usually 
      weak) associations between a complex trait (e.g., a disease status) and sets of 
      multiple genetic variants. Due to the lack of a uniformly most powerful test, 
      data-adaptive tests, such as the adaptive sum of powered score (aSPU) test, are 
      advantageous in maintaining high power against a wide range of alternatives. 
      However, there is often no closed-form to accurately and analytically calculate 
      the p-values of many adaptive tests like aSPU, thus Monte Carlo (MC) simulations 
      are often used, which can be time consuming to achieve a stringent significance 
      level (e.g., 5e-8) used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To estimate 
      such a small p-value, we need a huge number of MC simulations (e.g., 1e+10). As 
      an alternative, we propose using importance sampling to speed up such 
      calculations. We develop some theory to motivate a proposed algorithm for the 
      aSPU test, and show that the proposed method is computationally more efficient 
      than the standard MC simulations. Using both simulated and real data, we 
      demonstrate the superior performance of the new method over the standard MC 
      simulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in activity intolerance for a given 
      musculoskeletal pathophysiology. In other words, people often experience illness 
      beyond what one would expect given their level of pathophysiology. Mental health 
      (i.e., cognitive bias regarding pain [e.g., worst-case thinking] and 
      psychological distress [symptoms of anxiety and depression]) is an important and 
      treatable correlate of pain intensity and activity intolerance that accounts for 
      much of this variation. This study tested the degree to which psychological 
      distress accentuates the role of cognitive bias in the relationship between pain 
      intensity and activity intolerance. METHODS: We enrolled 125 adults with 
      musculoskeletal illness in a cross-sectional study. Participants completed 
      measures of activity intolerance related to pain (Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Pain Interference Computer Adaptive Test 
      [CAT]) and in general (PROMIS Physical Function CAT]), measures of psychological 
      distress (PROMIS Depression CAT and PROMIS Anxiety CAT), a numeric rating scale 
      (NRS) for pain intensity, measures of pain-related cognitive bias (4-question 
      versions of the Negative Pain Thoughts Questionnaire [NPTQ-4], Pain 
      Catastrophizing Scale [PCS-4], and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia [TSK-4]), and a 
      survey of demographic variables. We assessed the relationships of these measures 
      through mediation and moderation analyses using structural equation modeling. 
      RESULTS: Mediation analysis confirmed the large indirect relationship between 
      pain intensity (NRS) and activity intolerance (PROMIS Pain Interference CAT and 
      Physical Function CAT) through cognitive bias. Symptoms of depression and anxiety 
      had an unconditional (consistent) relationship with cognitive bias (NPTQ), but 
      there was no significant conditional effect/moderation (i.e., no increase in the 
      magnitude of the relationship with increasing symptoms of depression and 
      anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress accentuates the role of cognitive 
      bias in the relationship between pain intensity and activity intolerance. In 
      other words, misconceptions make humans ill, more so with greater symptoms of 
      depression or anxiety. Orthopaedic surgeons can approach their daily work with 
      the knowledge that addressing common misconceptions and identifying psychological 
      distress as a health improvement opportunity are important aspects of 
      musculoskeletal care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level III. See Instructions 
      for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Adaptive spatial working memory assessments for aging pet dogs.
PG  - 511-531

AB  - Assessments for spatial working memory (SWM) in pet dogs that can detect 
      age-related cognitive deficits in a single session may aid in diagnosing canine 
      dementia and may facilitate translational research on Alzheimer's disease in 
      humans. Adaptive testing procedures are widely used in single-session assessments 
      for humans with diverse cognitive abilities. In this study, we designed and 
      deployed two up-down staircase assessments for SWM in which 26 pet dogs were 
      required to recall the location of a treat hidden behind one of two identical 
      boxes following delays of variable length. In the first experiment, performance 
      tended to decline with age but few dogs completed the test (n = 10). However, all 
      of the dogs that participated in the second experiment (n = 24) completed the 
      assessment and provided reliable evidence of learning and retaining the task. 
      Delay length and age significantly predicted performance supporting the validity 
      of this assessment. The relationships between age and performance were described 
      by inverted U-shaped functions as both old and young dogs displayed deficits in 
      weighted cumulative-scores and trial-by-trial performance. Thus, SWM in pet dogs 
      may develop until midlife and decline thereafter. Exploratory analyses of 
      non-mnemonic fixation strategies, sustained engagement, inhibitory control, and 
      potential improvements for future SWM assessments which adopt this paradigm are 
      also discussed.

LID - 10.1111/jspn.12318 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop the Chinese version of the Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcome 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Emotional Distress item bank version 
      2.0-both conceptually equivalent to the original and relevant in the Chinese 
      culture. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress item bank 
      was translated, following the standard Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
      Therapy (FACIT) translation methodology, by a translation team. Eight children 
      aged 8-17 years from the general population were cognitively interviewed. 
      RESULTS: Most items were well understood by children, and some revisions were 
      made after the cognitive interviewing based on the suggestions of the 
      interviewees. The Chinese version of the Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress-v2.0 
      item bank was conceptually and semantically equivalent to the original. PRACTICE 
      IMPLICATIONS: The Chinese version of the Pediatric PROMIS-Emotional Distress item 
      bank is now available for further studies to develop computer adaptive tests 
      (CATs). Future CAT version measures may become a new standard measure for 
      children in the general population and those living with a chronic condition in 
      China.

TI  - Effect of the Wingman-Connect Upstream Suicide Prevention Program for Air Force 
      Personnel in Training: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e2022532
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.22532 [doi]
LID - e2022532
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Suicide has been a leading manner of death for US Air Force personnel 
      in recent years. Universal prevention programs that reduce suicidal thoughts and 
      behaviors in military populations have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine whether the Wingman-Connect program for Airmen-in-training reduces 
      suicidal ideation, depression, and occupational problems compared with a stress 
      management program and to test the underlying network health model positing that 
      cohesive, healthy units are protective against suicidal ideation. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted 
      from October 2017 to October 2019 and compared classes of personnel followed up 
      for 6 months. The setting was a US Air Force technical training school, with 
      participants studied to their first base assignment, whether US or international. 
      Participants in 216 classes were randomized, with an 84% retention rate. Data 
      analysis was performed from November 2019 to May 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The 
      Wingman-Connect program used group skill building for cohesion, shared purpose, 
      and managing career and personal stressors (3 blocks of 2 hours each). Stress 
      management training covered cognitive and behavioral strategies (2 hours). Both 
      conditions had a 1-hour booster session, plus text messages. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcomes were scores on the suicidal ideation and 
      depression scales of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health and 
      self-reports of military occupational impairment. Class network protective 
      factors hypothesized to mediate the effect of Wingman-Connect were assessed with 
      4 measures: cohesion assessed perceptions that classmates cooperate, work well 
      together, and support each other; morale was measured with a single item used in 
      other studies with military samples; healthy class norms assessed perceptions of 
      behaviors supported by classmates; and bonds to classmates were assessed by 
      asking each participant to name classmates whom they respect and would choose to 
      spend time with. RESULTS: A total of 215 classes including 1485 individuals (1222 
      men [82.3%]; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [3.1] years) participated; 748 individuals were 
      enrolled in the Wingman-Connect program and 737 individuals were enrolled in the 
      stress management program. At 1 month, the Wingman-Connect group reported lower 
      suicidal ideation severity (effect size [ES], -0.23; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.09; 
      P = .001) and depression symptoms (ES, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.08; P = .002) 
      and fewer occupational problems (ES, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.02; P = .02). At 
      6 months, the Wingman-Connect group reported lower depression symptoms 
      (ES, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02; P = .03), whereas the difference in suicidal 
      ideation severity was not significant (ES, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.29 to 0.01; 
      P = .06). The number needed to treat to produce 1 fewer participant with elevated 
      depression at either follow-up point was 21. The benefits of the training on 
      occupational problems did not extend past 1 month. The Wingman-Connect program 
      strengthened cohesive, healthy class units, which helped reduce suicidal ideation 
      severity (estimate, -0.035; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; P = .02) and depression 
      symptom scores (estimate, -0.039; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; P = .02) at 1 month. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Wingman-Connect is the first universal prevention 
      program to reduce suicidal ideation and depression symptoms in a general Air 
      Force population. Group training that builds cohesive, healthy military units is 
      promising for upstream suicide prevention and may be essential for ecological 
      validity. Extension of the program to the operational Air Force is recommended 
      for maintaining continuity and testing the prevention impact on suicidal 
      behavior. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04067401.

TI  - Applying Item Response Theory to the OPD Structure Questionnaire: Identification 
      of a Unidimensional Core Construct and Feasibility of Computer Adaptive Testing.
PG  - 645-658
LID - 10.1080/00223891.2020.1828435 [doi]
AB  - Recent developments in the dimensional assessment of personality functioning have 
      made the implementation of latent measurement models increasingly attractive. In 
      this study, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a well-established 
      personality functioning instrument (the OPD Structure Questionnaire) to identify 
      a unidimensional latent trait and to evaluate the feasibility of computer 
      adaptive testing (CAT). We hypothesized that the use of IRT could reduce the test 
      burden - compared to a fixed short form - while maintaining high precision over a 
      wide range of the latent trait. The OPD-SQ was collected from 1235 patients in a 
      psychosomatic clinic. IRT assumptions were fulfilled. A 9-factor model yielded 
      sufficient fit and unidimensionality in exploratory factor analysis with bifactor 
      rotation. Items were iteratively reduced, and a graded-response IRT model was 
      fitted to the data. Simulations showed that a CAT with approximately 7 items was 
      able to capture an OPD-SQ global severity score with an accuracy similar to that 
      of a fixed 12-item short form. The final item bank and CAT yielded satisfactory 
      content validity. Strong correlations with depression and anxiety replicated 
      previous results on the OPD-SQ. We concluded that IRT applications could be 
      useful to reduce the test burden of personality functioning instruments.

TI  - Balanced difficulty task finder: an adaptive recommendation method for learning 
      tasks based on the concept of state of flow.
PG  - 675-687
LID - 10.1007/s11571-020-09624-3 [doi]
AB  - An adaptive task difficulty assignment method which we reckon as balanced 
      difficulty task finder (BDTF) is proposed in this paper. The aim is to recommend 
      tasks to a learner using a trade-off between skills of the learner and difficulty 
      of the tasks such that the learner experiences a state of flow during the 
      learning. Flow is a mental state that psychologists refer to when someone is 
      completely immersed in an activity. Flow state is a multidisciplinary field of 
      research and has been studied not only in psychology, but also neuroscience, 
      education, sport, and games. The idea behind this paper is to try to achieve a 
      flow state in a similar way as Elo's chess skill rating (Glickman in Am Chess J 
      3:59-102) and TrueSkill (Herbrich et al. in Advances in neural information 
      processing systems, 2006) for matching game players, where "matched players" 
      should possess similar capabilities and skills in order to maintain the level of 
      motivation and involvement in the game. The BDTF draws analogy between choosing 
      an appropriate opponent or appropriate game level and automatically choosing an 
      appropriate difficulty level of a learning task. This method, as an intelligent 
      tutoring system, could be used in a wide range of applications from online 
      learning environments and e-learning, to learning and remembering techniques in 
      traditional methods such as adjusting delayed matching to sample and spaced 
      retrieval training that can be used for people with memory problems such as 
      people with dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative patient expectations and met expectations are likely 
      associated with the outcome of treatment. However, there is a lack of data 
      regarding the preoperative expectations and early postoperative met expectations 
      of patients undergoing extremity orthopaedic surgery. The purpose of this study 
      was to identify the predictors of early postoperative met expectations in a 
      cohort of patients undergoing extremity orthopaedic surgery and to assess the 
      relationship between patient expectations and patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
      measures. We hypothesized that patients with higher preoperative expectation 
      scores and higher postoperative met expectation scores would have better early 
      postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Four hundred thirty-five patients age seventeen 
      and older who underwent extremity orthopaedic surgery at one institution were 
      prospectively enrolled in this study. Each patient completed a preoperative 
      questionnaire that included an assessment of demographics, pain, function, 
      general health, treatment expectations, activity level, and Patient-Reported 
      Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing. 
      Expectations were evaluated using the Expectations Domain of the Musculoskeletal 
      Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System (MODEMS) questionnaire. Patients 
      completed a follow-up questionnaire two weeks after surgery that also assessed 
      MODEMS met expectations and satisfaction (Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire 
      (SSQ-8)). RESULTS: The mean preoperative expectation score was 86.95 +/- 16.59, and 
      the mean postoperative met expectation score was 55.02 +/- 27.63 (0-100 scale with 
      100 representing the highest level of expectations). Greater met expectations 
      were significantly associated with white race (p = 0.025), college degree 
      (p = 0.011), and higher income (p = 0.002). Greater met expectations were also 
      significantly associated with greater postoperative physical function, social 
      satisfaction, activity level, and subjective improvement, as well as lower pain 
      interference, joint pain, body pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.01 
      for each). Multivariable analysis results found that less postoperative joint 
      pain and greater postoperative social satisfaction, improvement, and physical 
      function were all significant independent predictors of greater met expectations 
      at two weeks postoperative (p < 0.01 for each). CONCLUSION: Greater preoperative 
      expectations are associated with better activity and less pain two weeks after 
      surgery. Met expectations of extremity orthopaedic surgery were associated with 
      postoperative physical function, social satisfaction, activity, pain, anxiety, 
      depression, and subjective improvement. These results may have implications for 
      preoperative counseling and risk factor modification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The healthcare industry is shifting its focus from traditional 
      clinical outcome measures to patient satisfaction metrics. This change has caused 
      orthopaedic surgeons to become increasingly interested in factors influencing 
      patient satisfaction, which would allow them to potentially modify these factors 
      in an effort to increase postoperative satisfaction. The objective of this study 
      was to identify factors associated with patient satisfaction two weeks following 
      extremity orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Patients completed questionnaires 
      preoperatively to assess demographics, activity, pain, expectations, and 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer 
      adaptive testing for Physical Function, Pain Interference, Social Satisfaction, 
      Depression, Anxiety, and Fatigue. Two weeks after their operation, patients 
      completed the same questionnaires in addition to an Improvement Survey and Met 
      Expectations. Satisfaction was assessed with the Surgical Satisfaction 
      Questionnaire. RESULTS: Greater surgical satisfaction two weeks following 
      orthopaedic surgery was associated with higher education, alcohol use, better 
      scores on all PROMIS domains at baseline and two weeks, greater activity levels 
      at baseline and two weeks, less bodily pain at baseline and two weeks, less pain 
      in the surgical site at two weeks, greater met expectations, and greater 
      improvement (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides important information 
      about patient satisfaction two weeks after orthopaedic surgery.

TI  - Sensory Processing, Functional Performance and Quality of Life in Unilateral 
      Cerebral Palsy Children: A Cross-Sectional Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17197116 [doi]
LID - 7116
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) has 
      traditionally focused on motor aspects. The extent to which sensory processing 
      disorders can affect their functional performance and quality of life (QoL) is 
      uncertain. This study aimed to explore the differences in sensory processing 
      between UCP and typical development (TD) children and to analyze the relationship 
      of sensory processing with functional performance and QoL. METHODS: Fifty-three 
      children aged from 6 to 15 years (TD = 24; UCP = 26) were recruited. The Child 
      Sensory Profile 2, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive 
      Test and Kidscreen were used to evaluate sensory processing, functional 
      performance and QoL. RESULTS: UCP children showed sensory processing difficulties 
      (avoidance: p = 0.02; registration: p = 0.00; body position: p = 0.00; oral: p = 
      0.02; social-emotional: p = 0.01), and scored lower in functional performance 
      (daily activities: p = 0.00; mobility: p = 0.00; social/cognitive: p = 0.04) and 
      in physical well-being (p = 0.00). The highest correlations in UCP group were 
      found between proprioceptive processing and daily activities and mobility (r = 
      -0.39); auditory, visual and tactile information and school environment (r = 
      -0.63; r = -0.51; r = -0.46); behavioral and social-emotional responses and 
      psychological well-being (r = -0.64; r = -0.49). CONCLUSIONS: UCP children have 
      greater difficulty in sensory processing than TD children. Difficulties in 
      proprioceptive processing contribute to poorer functional performance. Auditory, 
      visual and tactile processing is associated with participation in the school 
      environment and behavioral and social-emotional responses related to sensory 
      processing are associated with the psychological well-being.

TI  - Stopping Rules for Computer Adaptive Testing When Item Banks Have Nonuniform 
      Information.
PG  - 146-168
AB  - The standard error (SE) stopping rule, which terminates a computer adaptive test 
      (CAT) when the SE is less than a threshold, is effective when there are 
      informative questions for all trait levels. However, in domains such as patient 
      reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait 
      continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many 
      individuals. In such cases, the predicted standard error reduction (PSER) 
      stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the SE threshold has not been reached, 
      and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional 
      information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can 
      specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using simulated data 
      for the PROMIS Anxiety and Physical Function banks, we demonstrate that these 
      parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were 
      optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the SE stopping 
      rule overall and particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and 
      presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, 
      the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision 
      and efficiency of a CAT.

TI  - Discrimination Ability of Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 
      Pediatric Domains Compared With Scoliosis Research Society-22r and Legacy Patient 
      Reported Outcome Measures in Juvenile and Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.
PG  - 1713-1719
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000003683 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Comparative cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare patient reported 
      outcome measures (PROMs) in children and adolescents with varying extent of 
      spinal deformity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several PROMs have been proposed to 
      help assess health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in pediatric spinal deformity 
      surgery and research, but it is unclear which are sensitive to deformity 
      severity. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with spinal asymmetry or 
      juvenile/adolescent idiopathic scoliosis completed the patient-reported outcomes 
      management information system (PROMIS) pediatric computer adaptive test bank 
      (Domains: Mobility, Pain Interference, Physical Activity, Physical Stress 
      Experiences, Psychological Stress Experiences), Scoliosis Research Society-22r 
      (SRS-22r), Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale 
      (HSS Pedi-FABS) activity scale, and Trunk Appearance Perception Scale. Patients 
      were grouped as spinal asymmetry, mild deformity, and substantial deformity by 
      major Cobb angle measuring less than 10 degrees , between 10 degrees  and 40 degrees , and greater than 
      40 degrees  respectively. One-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post-hoc correction 
      was used to determine score differences between groups. RESULTS: Final analyses 
      included 206 patients, of which 135 (66%) were female. The mean age was 
      13.0 +/- 2.2 years, and the mean major Cobb angle was 20.1 +/- 14.1 degrees  (range: 
      0-74.2 degrees ). Compared with both spinal asymmetry and mild deformity patients, 
      patients with substantial deformity reported worse outcomes, including lower 
      function, more pain, and decreased psychological health by legacy PROMs and 
      PROMIS. PROMIS Physical Activity and Psychological Stress Experiences did not 
      capture any significant differences between all groups. There were no significant 
      differences in outcomes between the spinal asymmetry and mild deformity groups 
      for all PROMs measured. CONCLUSION: Patients with substantial spinal deformity 
      reported lower activity and function, more pain, and greater physical and 
      psychological stress compared with patients without clinical spinal deformity by 
      legacy PROMs and several PROMIS domains. As PROMIS Physical Activity and 
      Psychological Stress Experiences did not capture these differences, these PROMs 
      may measure different constructs than the legacy PROMs as they relate to spinal 
      curvature and may be less relevant to measure HRQoL in this population.Level of 
      Evidence 3.

TI  - Long-Term Neurodevelopmental and Functional Outcomes of Normally Developing 
      Children Requiring PICU Care for Bronchiolitis.
PG  - 282-288

AB  - Bronchiolitis is a common pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) illness and often 
      affects generally healthy children, making it a promising disease in which to 
      study long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We previously found that 
      approximately 15% of critical bronchiolitis patients have evidence of post-PICU 
      morbidity using coarse definitions available in administrative data sets. In this 
      study, we measured neurodevelopmental outcomes using four more precise tools. 
      Children who had previously been admitted to our PICU with bronchiolitis were 
      included; those with evidence of developmental delay at PICU admission were 
      excluded. Approximately 1 to 2 years after PICU discharge, the parent of each 
      subject completed two questionnaires (Ages and Stages Questionnaire and Pediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test). Each subject also 
      underwent two in-person assessments administered by a certified examiner (Bayley 
      Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition, and the Amiel-Tison 
      neurological assessment). For each domain of each test, a score of > 1 standard 
      deviation below the norm for the subject's age defined "moderate" disability and 
      a score >/= 2 standard deviations below the norm defined "severe" disability. 
      Eighteen subjects (median ages of 3.7 months at PICU admission and 2.3 years at 
      testing) were enrolled, 17 of whom were supported by high-flow nasal cannula 
      and/or mechanical ventilation. Fifteen children (83%) scored abnormally on >/= 
      1test. Eight children (44%) had disabilities in >/= 3 domains and/or >/= 1 severe 
      disability identified. Our findings that motor, language, and cognitive 
      disabilities are commonly observed months to years after critical bronchiolitis 
      require larger studies to confirm this finding, assess causality, and identify 
      modifiable risk factors.

TI  - Developmental Predictors of Cognitive and Adaptive Outcomes in Genetic Subtypes 
      of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 1659-1669
LID - 10.1002/aur.2385 [doi]
AB  - Approximately one-fourth of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases are associated 
      with a disruptive genetic variant. Many of these ASD genotypes have been 
      described previously, and are characterized by unique constellations of medical, 
      psychiatric, developmental, and behavioral features. Development of precision 
      medicine care for affected individuals has been challenging due to the phenotypic 
      heterogeneity that exists even within each genetic subtype. In the present study, 
      we identify developmental milestones that predict cognitive and adaptive outcomes 
      for five of the most common ASD genotypes. Sixty-five youth with a known 
      pathogenic variant involving ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A genes 
      participated in cognitive and adaptive testing. Exploratory linear regressions 
      were used to identify developmental milestones that predicted cognitive and 
      adaptive outcomes within each gene group. We hypothesized that the earliest and 
      most predictive milestones would vary across gene groups, but would be consistent 
      across outcomes within each genetic subtype. Within the ADNP group, age of 
      walking predicted cognitive outcomes, while age of first words predicted adaptive 
      behaviors. Age of phrases predicted adaptive functioning in the CHD8 group, but 
      cognitive outcomes were not clearly associated with early developmental 
      milestones. Verbal milestones were the strongest predictors of cognitive and 
      adaptive outcomes for individuals with mutations to DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A. 
      These trends inform decisions about treatment planning and long-term expectations 
      for affected individuals, and they add to the growing body of research linking 
      molecular genetic function to brain development and phenotypic outcomes. LAY 
      SUMMARY: Researchers have found many genetic causes of autism including mutations 
      to ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, and SCN2A genes. We found that each genetic cause 
      had different early developmental milestones that explained the overall 
      functioning of the children when they were older. Depending on the genetic cause, 
      the age that a child first starts walking and/or talking may help to better 
      understand and support a child's development who has a mutation to one of the 
      above genes. Autism Res 2020, 13: 1659-1669. (c) 2020 International Society for

TI  - Comparison of patient-reported outcomes measurement information system and legacy 
      instruments in multiple domains among older veterans with chronic back pain.
PG  - 598

LID - 598
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) results in significant physical, 
      psycho-social and socioeconomic burden. Identifying efficient and reliable 
      patient reported outcome measures is critical for research and clinical purposes. 
      The NIH's Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      instruments have not been compared to validated "legacy" instruments in older 
      adults with cLBP. This study evaluates construct (convergent and discriminant) 
      validity and time to complete (TTC) PROMIS as compared to legacy instruments. 
      METHODS: We enrolled older Veterans (age 60+) with cLBP with/without leg pain 
      scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Subjects completed PROMIS 
      computer adaptive test item banks and corresponding legacy instruments in the 
      following domains: pain intensity, interference, and behavior; functional status; 
      depression and anxiety; fatigue; sleep and social functioning. Convergent and 
      discriminant validity between PROMIS and legacy instruments was evaluated using 
      Spearman rank order correlations; Mann-Whitney U tests compared TTC. RESULTS: Of 
      the 71 Veterans recruited, the median (IQR) age was 67 (63-71) years old, 94% 
      were men, 76% were White, 17% Black, and 96% were Non-Hispanic. Spearman 
      correlations between PROMIS and legacy instruments showed moderate to very strong 
      convergent validity in all domains (r = 0.4-1.0), except for social functioning 
      and pain behavior (PROMIS Pain Behavior with Fear Avoidance Belief 
      Questionnaire). The total median TTC for all PROMIS items was significantly 
      shorter than legacy items, 8 min 50 s vs 29 min 14 s respectively, p < 0.001. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Given time efficiency of using PROMIS, along with strong construct 
      validity, PROMIS instruments are a practical choice for measuring 
      multidimensional PROs in older Veterans with cLBP for both research and clinical 
      purposes.

LID - 10.1177/0013164419901292 [doi]
AB  - The present study extended the p-optimality method to the multistage computerized 
      adaptive test (MST) context in developing optimal item pools to support different 
      MST panel designs under different test configurations. Using the Rasch model, 
      simulated optimal item pools were generated with and without practical 
      constraints of exposure control. A total number of 72 simulated optimal item 
      pools were generated and evaluated by an overall sample and conditional sample 
      using various statistical measures. Results showed that the optimal item pools 
      built with the p-optimality method provide sufficient measurement accuracy under 
      all simulated MST panel designs. Exposure control affected the item pool size, 
      but not the item distributions and item pool characteristics. This study 
      demonstrated that the p-optimality method can adapt to MST item pool design, 
      facilitate the MST assembly process, and improve its scoring accuracy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluate efficiency, precision, and validity of RetCAT, which comprises 
      ten diabetic retinopathy (DR) quality of life (QoL) computerized adaptive tests 
      (CATs). METHODS: In this cross-sectional clinical study, 183 English and/or 
      Mandarin-speaking participants with DR (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 56.4 +/- 
      11.9 years; 38% proliferative DR [worse eye]) were recruited from retinal clinics 
      in Singapore. Participants answered the RetCAT tests (Symptoms, Activity 
      Limitation, Mobility, Emotional, Health Concerns, Social, Convenience, Economic, 
      Driving, and Lighting), which were capped at seven items each, and other 
      questionnaires, and underwent eye tests. Our primary evaluation focused on RetCAT 
      efficiency (i.e. standard error of measurement [SEM] +/- SD achieved and time 
      needed to complete each CAT). Secondary evaluations included an assessment of 
      RetCAT's test precision and validity. RESULTS: Mean SEM across all RetCAT tests 
      was 0.351, ranging from 0.272 +/- 0.130 for Economic to 0.484 +/- 0.130 for 
      Emotional. Four tests (Mobility, Social, Convenience, and Driving) had a high 
      level of measurement error. The median time to take each RetCAT test was 1.79 
      minutes, ranging from 1.12 (IQR [interquartile range] 1.63) for Driving to 3.28 
      (IQR 2.52) for Activity Limitation. Test precision was highest for participants 
      at the most impaired end of the spectrum. Most RetCAT tests displayed expected 
      correlations with other scales (convergent/divergent validity) and were sensitive 
      to DR and/or vision impairment severity levels (criterion validity). CONCLUSIONS: 
      RetCAT can provide efficient, precise, and valid measurement of DR-related QoL 
      impact. Future application of RetCAT will employ a stopping rule based on SE 
      rather than number of items to ensure that all tests can detect meaningful 
      differences in person abilities. Responsiveness of RetCAT to treatment 
      interventions must also be determined. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: RetCAT may be 
      useful for measuring the patient-centered impact of DR severity and disease 
      progression and evaluating the effectiveness of new therapies.

TI  - Responsiveness to change over time and test-retest reliability of the PROMIS and 
      Neuro-QoL mental health measures in persons with Huntington disease (HD).
PG  - 3419-3439

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of persons with Huntington disease (HD) experience 
      mental health symptoms. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are capable of 
      capturing unobservable behaviors and feelings relating to mental health. The 
      current study aimed to test the reliability and responsiveness to self-reported 
      and clinician-rated change over time of Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs 
      over the course of a 24-month period. METHODS: At baseline, 12-months, and 
      24-months, 362 participants with premanifest or manifest HD completed the 
      Neuro-QoL Depression computer adaptive test (CAT), PROMIS Depression short form 
      (SF), Neuro-QoL Anxiety CAT, PROMIS Anxiety SF, PROMIS Anger CAT and SF, 
      Neuro-QoL Emotional/Behavioral Dyscontrol CAT and SF, Neuro-QoL Positive Affect 
      and Well-Being CAT and SF, and Neuro-QoL Stigma CAT and SF. Participants 
      completed several clinician-administered measures at each time point, as well as 
      several global ratings of change at 12- and 24-months. Reliability (test-retest 
      reliability and measurement error) and responsiveness (using standardized 
      response means and general linear models) were assessed. RESULTS: Test-retest 
      reliability and measurement error were excellent for all PROs (all ICC >/= .90 for 
      test-retest reliability and all SEM percentages </= 6.82%). In addition, 12- and 
      24-month responsiveness were generally supported for the Neuro-QoL and PROMIS 
      mental health PROs; findings relative to clinician-rated anchors of change (e.g., 
      SRMs for the group with declines ranged from .38 to .91 for 24-month change and 
      .09 to .45, with the majority above .25 for 12-month change) were generally more 
      robust than those relative to self-reported anchors of change (e.g., SRMs for the 
      group with declines ranged from .02 to .75, with the majority above .39 for 
      24-month change and .09 to .45, with the majority above .16 for 12-month change). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Neuro-QoL and PROMIS mental health PROs demonstrated strong 
      psychometric reliability, as well as responsiveness to self-reported and 
      clinician-rated change over time in people with HD.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is a critical gap in the literature regarding the efficacy of 
      occupational therapy interventions for pediatric hematopoietic cell 
      transplantation (HCT) patients. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that occupational 
      therapy 4-5x/wk during inpatient hospitalization positively affects strength, 
      coordination, and independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) of pediatric 
      patients during HCT. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient bone marrow 
      transplant unit at a children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two pediatric 
      patients admitted for HCT. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were seen by an 
      occupational therapist as part of an interdisciplinary program. Interventions 
      included play and leisure engagement, upper extremity therapeutic exercises, fine 
      motor activities, and ADL training. Strength, coordination, and daily living 
      skills data were documented prospectively and analyzed retrospectively to compare 
      differences between patients seen by occupational therapy at high versus low 
      frequency. RESULTS: For grip strength (dynamometer), fine motor dexterity (the 
      9-Hole Peg Test), and independence in ADLs (an ADL functional measure and the 
      Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test Daily 
      Activities), the high-frequency group had a significantly smaller decrease in 
      performance from time of admission at pretransplant (baseline) to peak decline 
      after transplant. Grip strength and ADL scores for the high-frequency group 
      returned to baseline at time of discharge more readily than for the low-frequency 
      group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Participation in occupational therapy 4-5x/wk 
      had positive effects on strength, coordination, and independence in ADLs for 
      patients undergoing HCT. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: This article provides evidence 
      that occupational therapists are an important part of the interdisciplinary team 
      treating pediatric bone marrow transplant patients. It also demonstrates that 
      occupational therapy interventions delivered at a high frequency can have a 
      positive impact on upper extremity strength and independence in ADLs.

TI  - Differences in Self-Reported Physical and Behavioral Health in Musculoskeletal 
      Patients Based on Physician Gender.
PG  - 720-728
LID - 10.1002/pmrj.12468 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences in patient-physician interactions based on physician 
      gender have been demonstrated. However, the association between patients' 
      self-perceived health and their decision to see a female versus male physician is 
      still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine if self-reported physical or behavioral 
      health is different in musculoskeletal patients who present to female vs male 
      physicians. We hypothesized that patients who present to female physicians report 
      worse physical and behavioral health. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: 
      Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Consecutive 21 980 adult patients who 
      presented to a musculoskeletal medicine specialist for initial evaluation of a 
      musculoskeletal condition between April 1, 2016 and November 1, 2017. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression 
      Computer Adaptive Test domains of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS). The primary study outcome was the mean difference 
      (MD) in PROMIS scores by physician gender. RESULTS: Patients who presented to 
      female physicians self-reported slightly worse health in all domains: Physical 
      Function (female physicians 40.2, male physicians 42.4, MD -2.1; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] -2.5 to -1.8), Pain Interference (female physicians 61.6, male 
      physicians 60.4, MD 1.3 [1.0-1.5]), Anxiety (female physicians 52.5, male 
      physicians 51.4, MD 1.1 [0.8-1.5]), and Depression (female physicians 47.5, male 
      physicians 46.2, MD 1.3 [0.9-1.6]) (all P < .001). Patients who presented to 
      female physicians were also slightly younger (51.9 vs 52.4 years, P = .034) and 
      more likely to be female (63% vs 56%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who 
      presented to female physicians self-reported slightly worse physical and 
      behavioral health compared to those patients who presented to male physicians. 
      Further investigation into this finding may provide insight into drivers of 
      patients' preferences, which may enable physicians of both genders to optimize 
      patient care.

AB  - Time use studies uncover the organization of daily routine of families of 
      children with disabilities. The objective of this study is to identify 
      determinants of time spent caring for children/adolescents with cerebral palsy 
      (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typical development (TD). Participants 
      were caregivers of children/adolescents with/without disability. Structural 
      equation modeling tested a proposed model of time spent in child care. The 
      variables in the model were as follows: questionnaire (families' socioeconomic 
      status [SES]), children's functioning (The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability 
      Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test [PEDI-CAT]); hours of care (daily diaries), 
      number of adaptations used, and help with child care (parents' report). Distinct 
      variable combinations explained 78% of the variation in the time to care (TD 
      model), followed by 42% (ASD) and 29% (CP). Adaptations indirectly affected time 
      to care through its effect on functioning (CP); family's SES affected functioning 
      through its effect on adaptation use (ASD). In conclusion, knowledge of factors 
      affecting caregivers' time spent on children's care help occupational therapists 
      implement family-centered strategies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective correlational study was to compare the 
      psychometric properties of the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales with 
      those of traditional legacy scales over a longitudinal postoperative period in 
      patients undergoing arthroscopic procedures. METHODS: Active-duty military 
      personnel undergoing shoulder and knee arthroscopic procedures completed the 
      DVPRS, PROMIS, and legacy scales preoperatively and again at 3 months 
      postoperatively. Rolling correlation coefficients (r(rm)) were used to assess the 
      concurrent validity between the DVPRS average pain scores and computer adaptive 
      testing PROMIS scales (Anxiety, Depression, Pain Behavior, Pain Interference, 
      Mobility, Sleep Disturbance, Satisfaction With Social Roles, and Upper Extremity 
      Physical Function) and the legacy scales (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      [ASES] scale, Shoulder Activity Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee 
      [IKDC] questionnaire, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation [SANE], Marx Activity 
      Rating Scale, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey). RESULTS: A total of 121 
      participants completed the scales preoperatively, 80 completed them at 3 months 
      postoperatively, and 59 (49% of participants) completed them at both times. 
      Rolling correlation coefficients between PROMIS Pain Interference (r(rm) = -0.41, 
      P = .006), Satisfaction With Social Roles (r(rm) = 0.56, P < .001), and Upper 
      Extremity (r(rm) = 0.71, P < .001) scores showed acceptable concurrent validity 
      with ASES scores over a longitudinal postoperative period. DVPRS scores (r(rm) = 
      -0.69, P = .002) and PROMIS Pain Behavior (r(rm) = -0.57, P = .018), Pain 
      Interference (r(rm) = -0.71, P = .001), Sleep Disturbance (r(rm) = -0.64, P = 
      .005), and Mobility (r(rm) = 0.65, P = .005) scores showed acceptable concurrent 
      validity with IKDC scores. There was poor correlation between the PROMIS and 
      DVPRS scores and the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Marx Activity Rating 
      Scale, Shoulder Activity Scale, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey scores. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS scales measuring physical function, pain presentation, and 
      other health domains showed acceptable concurrent validity with ASES and IKDC 
      scores. By integrating the prospective collection of biopsychosocial PROMIS 
      scales into practice, it is possible for clinicians in orthopaedic settings to 
      assess changes in validated patient-reported outcomes to inform patient-centered 
      care planning throughout the postoperative recovery period. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Level II, prospective comparative study (with not all participants completing 
      follow-up).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common mental 
      disorders among children and adolescents, and it may seriously affect their 
      growth, daily life, and learning. Self-report scales have been used for 
      diagnosis, which require lengthy testing and personnel. METHODS: A total of 1,241 
      adolescents were recruited from 16 junior- and senior-high schools in China. The 
      initial item bank was selected from classical SAD scales according to the DSM-5. 
      First, the optimal model was selected using item response theory (IRT) according 
      to data fit. Then, per the IRT analysis, items that did not meet the psychometric 
      requirements were deleted (e.g., discriminating values < 0.2). Consequently, a 
      computerized adaptive test (CAT) for SAD was formed (CAT-SAD). RESULTS: An 
      average of 17 items per participant was required to achieve and maintain a 0.3 
      standard error of measurement in the SAD severity estimate. The estimated 
      correlation of the CAT-SAD with the total 68-item test score was 0.955. CAT-SAD 
      scores were strongly related to the probability of a SAD diagnosis with the 
      Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale-Child and Adolescent Version. Therefore, SAD 
      could be accurately predicted by the CAT-SAD. CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory factor 
      analyses revealed that SAD was unidimensional. The CAT-SAD, which has good 
      reliability and validity and high sensitivity and specificity, provides an 
      efficient test for adolescents with SAD as compared to standard paper-and-pencil 
      tests. It can be used to diagnose varying degrees of SAD quickly and reliably and 
      ease the burden on adolescents. Potential applications for inexpensive, 
      efficient, and accurate screening of SAD are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prechtl's general movements assessment (GMA) post-term has high 
      predictive validity for cerebral palsy, but less is known about whether earlier 
      GMA, including before term, are associated with other developmental problems. 
      AIMS: To examine the relationships between GMA prior to term and at 
      term-equivalent, with developmental outcomes at 4.5-5 years' corrected age. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: 122 very preterm infants born 
      <30 weeks' gestation and 91 healthy term controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: GMA 
      (categorised as 'normal' or 'abnormal') were assessed at <32, 32-33 and 
      34-36 weeks' postmenstrual age for the preterm infants, and at term-equivalent 
      for both groups. Children were assessed at 4.5-5 years' corrected age using the 
      Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd edition (MABC-2), Pediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT), Pediatric 
      Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Little Developmental Coordination Disorder 
      Questionnaire (Little DCD-Q) and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of 
      Intelligence-IV (WPPSI-IV). RESULTS: Prior to term, abnormal GMA at the first two 
      timepoints were associated with lower scores on the Little DCD-Q, and abnormal 
      GMA at the second and third timepoints with lower quality of life scores and 
      PEDI-CAT mobility domain scores. Abnormal GMA at term-equivalent were associated 
      with lower MABC-2, mobility and quality of life scores for preterm infants, and 
      worse social/cognitive domain scores for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal GMA 
      prior to term and at term-equivalent are associated with worse motor, functional 
      and cognitive outcomes at 4.5-5 years' corrected age, and may be useful to 
      identify infants for developmental surveillance/early intervention.

TI  - Multi-trait Genome-Wide Analyses of the Brain Imaging Phenotypes in UK Biobank.
PG  - 947-958
LID - 10.1534/genetics.120.303242 [doi]
AB  - Many genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are 
      associated with multiple, sometimes seemingly unrelated, traits. This motivates 
      multi-trait association analyses, which have successfully identified novel 
      associated loci for many complex diseases. While appealing, most existing methods 
      focus on analyzing a relatively small number of traits, and may yield inflated 
      Type 1 error rates when a large number of traits need to be analyzed jointly. As 
      deep phenotyping data are becoming rapidly available, we develop a novel method, 
      referred to as aMAT (adaptive multi-trait association test), for multi-trait 
      analysis of any number of traits. We applied aMAT to GWAS summary statistics for 
      a set of 58 volumetric imaging derived phenotypes from the UK Biobank. aMAT had a 
      genomic inflation factor of 1.04, indicating the Type 1 error rate was well 
      controlled. More important, aMAT identified 24 distinct risk loci, 13 of which 
      were ignored by standard GWAS. In comparison, the competing methods either had a 
      suspicious genomic inflation factor or identified much fewer risk loci. Finally, 
      four additional sets of traits have been analyzed and provided similar 
      conclusions.

TI  - Construct validity of the personality inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD): Evidence from 
      the MMPI-2-RF and CAT-PD-SF.
PG  - 889-895
LID - 10.1037/pas0000914 [doi]
AB  - The Personality Inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD) was recently developed to assess the 
      ICD-11 model of personality disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine 
      the construct validity of the PiCD using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
      Inventory (MMPI)-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) and the Computerized Adaptive 
      Test of Personality Disorders Static Form (CAT-PD-SF). We administered these 
      tests to 328 college students (150 males, 178 females). We found that the PiCD 
      had adequate internal consistency reliability. Correlations between scores from 
      the PiCD scales and the criterion measures generally indicated adequate 
      discriminant validity. Along the same lines, convergent validity was adequate for 
      the PiCD Negative Affective, Disinhibition, and Dissocial scales. However, the 
      evidence was more mixed for the PiCD Detachment and Anankastic domains, which may 
      be due to limitations with the content domains for these scales. Consistent with 
      other research and theoretical expectations, a conjoint exploratory factor 
      analysis utilizing the PiCD and MMPI-2-RF PSY-5 scales also indicated that 
      anankastic and disinhibition may be more appropriately conceptualized as 
      measuring opposite poles of one construct. Implications of these findings for the 
      PiCD and the ICD-11 model are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA,

TI  - Do emotional distress and functional problems in persons with traumatic brain 
      injury contribute to perceived sleep-related impairment in caregivers?
LID - 10.1037/rep0000327 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the association between 
      characteristics of persons with traumatic brain injury (PwTBI) and perceived 
      sleep-related impairment of the caregivers. METHOD: Fifty-two dyads (n = 23 
      civilians, n = 29 service members/veterans [SMVs]) were enrolled. Caregivers 
      completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      Sleep-Related Impairment computer adaptive test, and PwTBI completed Quality of 
      Life in Neurological Disorders measures of depression, anxiety, anger, cognitive 
      functioning, and upper and lower extremity functioning. Hierarchical linear 
      regression models, stratified by civilian/SMV group, were employed to assess 
      prediction of caregiver-perceived sleep-related impairment from emotional 
      distress of the PwTBI (anxiety, depressed mood, and anger) and perceived 
      functional status of the PwTBI (cognitive, upper extremity, lower extremity 
      functioning). RESULTS: Compared with caregivers of civilians, caregivers of SMVs 
      reported higher perceived sleep-related impairment. Regression results showed 
      that characteristics of the PwTBI accounted for moderate amounts of variance in 
      the sleep-related impairment of caregivers of both civilians and SMVs. 
      Within-group analyses showed that the strongest predictor of sleep-related 
      impairment of caregivers of civilians was self-reported cognitive function of the 
      PwTBI (beta = -0.82, p = .08); the strongest predictor of sleep-related impairment 
      of caregivers of SMVs was self-reported anger of the PwTBI (beta = 0.54, p = .07). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In both caregivers of civilians and SMVs with TBI, characteristics 
      of the PwTBI were related to perceived caregiver sleep-related impairment. These 
      preliminary data can inform future research with larger samples that examine the 
      impact of multiple characteristics of the caregiver and care recipient on 
      caregiver sleep. Findings highlight the potential importance of considering the 
      dynamics of the dyad in rehabilitation programming not only for the PwTBI but for 
      caregivers as well. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Entrepreneurial behavior is of great importance nowadays 
      owing to its significance in the generation of economic, social, personal, and 
      cultural wellbeing. This behavior is influenced by cognitive and personality 
      characteristics, as well as by socioeconomic and contextual factors. 
      Entrepreneurial personality is made up of a set of psychological traits including 
      self-efficacy, autonomy, innovation, internal locus of control, achievement 
      motivation, optimism, stress tolerance, and risk-taking. The aim of this research 
      is the development of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to evaluate 
      entrepreneurial personality. METHOD: A bank of 120 items was created evaluating 
      various aspects of the entrepreneurial personality. The items were calibrated 
      with the Samejima Graded Response Model using a sample of 1170 participants 
      (M(age) = 42.34; SD(age) = 12.96). RESULTS: The bank of items had an essentially 
      unidimensional fit to the model. The CAT exhibited high accuracy for evaluating a 
      wide range of theta scores, using a mean of 16 items with a very low standard error 
      (M = 0.157). Relative validity evidence for the CAT was obtained with two 
      additional tests of entrepreneurial personality (the Battery for the Assessment 
      of the Enterprising Personality and the Measure of Enterpreneurial Tendencies and 
      Abilities), with correlations of .908 and .657, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      CAT developed has appropriate psychometric properties for the evaluation of 
      entrepreneurial people.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing increased cognitive stimulation or learning opportunities 
      to young children significantly increases cognitive and social-emotional 
      competence later in life. This study aims to determine the acceptability of a 
      pediatric assessment tool to track early child development (ECD) in a rural 
      health district in Limpopo, South Africa. METHODS: A total of 11 primary health 
      nurses from the region in two focus groups were selected to learn and compare two 
      ECD assessment tools: the Cognitive Adaptive Test/Clinical Linguistic and 
      Auditory Milestone Scale (CAT/CLAMS) and Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). 
      Data were analyzed using versus coding to compare between the two focus groups 
      and between ASQ and CAT/CLAMS. RESULTS: The major categories that emerged from 
      the discussion were current practice, usability, resource management, cultural 
      adaptation, patient and parent factors, and new knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study illustrates the challenges related to adapting and implementing ECD 
      assessment in an environment where ECD is largely unknown by local residents, and 
      differs from the environment in which the tool was initially developed. Further 
      work is needed to develop new tools or alter existing tools that can be adapted 
      to diverse settings and cultures.

TI  - Symptom burden trajectories experienced by patients with brain tumors.
PG  - 3341-3351
LID - 10.1002/cncr.32879 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood brain tumors experience persistent health 
      concerns across their lifespan. In the current study, the authors evaluated 
      changes in symptom burden over the course of 12 months using pediatric 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. 
      METHODS: Data from 202 survivors aged 8 to 21 years and 262 parents of survivors 
      who were aged 5 to 21 years were analyzed. All completed a PROMIS Cognition short 
      form and computerized adaptive tests of pediatric Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, 
      Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity Function, and Peer Relationships. 
      Approximately one-half of participants (223 participants: 97 survivors of 
      childhood brain tumors and 126 parents) completed the 12-month follow-up. Linear 
      mixed-effects models evaluated group-level symptoms over time. Cox proportional 
      hazard models explored whether symptoms predicted survival, and latent class 
      growth analysis investigated patterns of individual-level symptom changes over 
      time. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that patient-reported 
      Cognition and parent-reported Anxiety worsened over time. Latent class growth 
      analysis results indicated that patient and parent reports diverged, both with 
      regard to the number of classes identified and in the trends of these classes. 
      Parents and patients reported similar patterns of depression over time. For the 
      other areas, parents either were more likely to observe different patterns (Peer 
      Relationships and Mobility) or less likely to observe different patterns (Upper 
      Extremity Function, Cognition, Anxiety, and Fatigue). Baseline patient-reported 
      Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were found to be associated with survival. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood brain tumors demonstrated different 
      trajectory patterns of symptom burden. Along with baseline functioning status and 
      days since treatment, patient-reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were 
      associated with survival, suggesting a possible role for patient-reported 
      outcomes in clinical care, especially individualized, tailored assessments such 
      as PROMIS.

TI  - The impact of socioeconomic status and social deprivation on musculoskeletal 
      limitations.
PG  - 135-142
LID - 10.1016/j.jor.2020.03.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Objective (SES) and subjective socioeconomic status (SSS) affect 
      symptom intensity and magnitude of limitations. Identification of potentially 
      modifiable social risk factors might contribute to additional opportunities for 
      optimizing musculoskeletal health. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) There are no 
      correlations between magnitude of limitations (as measured with Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function [PROMIS PF computer 
      adaptive test]) and components of SES or SSS in people with musculoskeletal 
      disease; (2) There are no factors (including level of social deprivation) 
      independently associated with PROMIS PF. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine 
      patients presenting to clinicians specializing in the treatment of a broad 
      variety of musculoskeletal conditions were prospectively enrolled in the study. 
      We recorded patient demographics and assessed patients' socioeconomic status 
      using the MacArthur Sociodemographic questionnaire and physical disability rating 
      using PROMIS PF. Patients deprivation index was retrieved using their 9-digit ZIP 
      codes. We used bivariate analysis to determine correlations between magnitude of 
      limitations and socioeconomic status. We created a stepwise backward 
      multivariable linear regression model to assess factors independently associated 
      with PROMIS PF. RESULTS: Weak correlations were found on bivariate analysis of 
      PROMIS PF with SSS measured as "Place in community" (r 0.28; P < 0.001) and 
      "Place in the United States of America" (r 0.25; P = 0.002). In the multivariable 
      models, the area deprivation index was not independently associated with physical 
      limitations. Male gender (beta regression coefficient [beta] 4.1; 95% CI 0.71 to 
      7.5; P = 0.018) and having net worth of $5000 - $19,999 (beta 6.3; 95% CI 0.35 to 
      12; P = 0.038) or $20,000 - $99,999 (beta 5.8; 95% CI 2.1 to 9.5; P = 0.003) when 
      compared to having net worth of less than $4999 were independently associated 
      with better physical function. Being unemployed or disabled and keeping house, 
      being a student, or retired were independently associated with worse physical 
      function (beta -12; 95% CI -18 to -7.0; P < 0.001; beta -5.6; 95% CI -9.9 to -1.4; 
      P = 0.009, respectively), when compared to working full-time or part-time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Objective and subjective measures of socioeconomic status are 
      associated with magnitude of physical limitations in patients with 
      musculoskeletal illness. These factors should be considered when developing 
      treatment plans for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Level II prognostic study.

TI  - Evaluation of the measurement properties of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) in 
      Hispanic caregivers to patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
PG  - 1073-1084
LID - 10.1017/S1041610220000502 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used measure of 
      perceived stress; however, minimal psychometric evaluation has been performed 
      among Hispanic respondents, and even less among Hispanic caregivers to persons 
      with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRDs). DESIGN: Secondary data 
      analysis. SETTING: New York City, NY, USA. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 453 
      community dwelling Hispanic caregivers to patients with ADRD. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Latent variable models were used to evaluate the PSS. Exploratory and 
      confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine unidimensionality. Differential 
      item functioning (DIF) was examined for age, education, and language using the 
      graded item response model. RESULTS: The factor and bifactor analyses results 
      supported essential unidimensionality of the item set; however, positively worded 
      items were observed using response item theory to be less informative than the 
      negatively worded items. Reliability estimates were high. Salient DIF was not 
      observed for age, education, or language of interview using the primary DIF 
      detection method. Sensitivity analyses using a second DIF detection method 
      identified uniform language-DIF for the item, "In the last month, how often have 
      you felt that you were on top of things?" However, the non-compensatory DIF value 
      was below the threshold considered salient. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the 10-item 
      PSS performed well in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic 
      caregivers to patients with ADRD. Very little DIF, and none of high magnitude and 
      impact, was observed. However, the negatively worded items, perhaps because they 
      are more directly reflective of stress, were more informative. In the context of 
      a short-form measure or computerized adaptive test, more informative items are 
      those that would be selected for inclusion.

TI  - The utility of PROMIS domain measures in dermatologic care.
PG  - 17-24
LID - 10.1007/s00403-020-02074-1 [doi]
AB  - Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures play an important role in clinical care. 
      Currently, a broad-spectrum, validated PRO measure suitable for all dermatology 
      patients, as part of clinical care, does not exist. Patient-reported Outcome 
      Measures Information System (PROMIS) measures track specific domain outcomes 
      across all diseases. To assess the relevance and utility of a computer-adaptive 
      health assessment consisting of three PROMIS domains in routine dermatologic 
      care. This retrospective study evaluated a PROMIS health assessment, consisting 
      of three computer-adaptive test domains (pain interference, anxiety, and 
      depression), administered as part of routine clinical care in three dermatology 
      clinics at an academic medical center. The primary objective was to identify 
      clinically significant associations between high PROMIS domain scores (i.e., t 
      score > 55) and dermatologic disease, as well as change in PROMIS domain scores 
      in response to treatment. The majority of patients who initiated the assessment 
      completed all domains (88.7%). In patients with atopic dermatitis, acne, 
      hidradenitis suppurativa, and psoriasis, high PROMIS scores correlated with 
      clinically relevant outcomes, such as severe disease, unsuccessful treatment, 
      uncontrolled disease, and the presence of a mental health condition. PROMIS Pain 
      Interference, anxiety and depression identified patients with severe disease, 
      unsuccessful treatment regimens, poorly-controlled disease, and/or mental health 
      comorbidities for multiple skin conditions. Further utilization of PROMIS domains 
      in routine clinical care will promote patient-centered care and improve quality 
      of care.

LID - 10.1080/14779072.2020.1748011 [doi]
AB  - Background: FCS significantly affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL). 
      Legacy patient-reported outcome measures are often not sensitive to FCS's impact. 
      NIH PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures may accurately capture HRQOL in FCS patients. 
      This study assessed a broad range of PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures covering 
      physical, mental, and social HRQOL to determine their suitability for the FCS 
      population.Methods: Adult FCS patients in the United States (N = 25) were 
      recruited to an online survey study and completed several PROMIS short forms and 
      Neuro-QoL computer adaptive tests.Results: Scores were more than 0.5 standard 
      deviations (SD) worse than the normative mean on 10 of 16 normed measures, and 
      more than 0.75 SDs worse than the normative mean on two measures. Responses at 
      the floor and ceiling were occasionally observed, marginal reliabilities were 
      strong, and significant differences across performance status (ps < 0.05) 
      provided preliminary support for construct validity. The measures correlated with 
      each other strongly and as expected.Conclusion: Results support the ability of 
      PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures to detect HRQOL impairment among patients with FCS. 
      PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measures captured the functional impact and symptom burden 
      associated with FCS, and the broad range of symptom severity experienced by 
      patients with FCS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Questionnaires to detect emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) in 
      Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH) should be short which potentially affects 
      validity and reliability. Simulation studies have shown that Computerized 
      Adaptive Testing (CAT) could overcome these weaknesses. We studied the 
      applicability (using the measures participation rate, satisfaction, and 
      efficiency) and the validity of CAT in routine PCH practice. METHODS: We analyzed 
      data on 461 children aged 10-11 years (response 41%), who were assessed during 
      routine well-child examinations by PCH professionals. Before the visit, parents 
      completed the CAT and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Satisfaction was 
      measured by parent- and PCH professional-report. Efficiency of the CAT procedure 
      was measured as number of items needed to assess whether a child has serious 
      problems or not. Its validity was assessed using the CBCL as the criterion. 
      RESULTS: Parents and PCH professionals rated the CAT on average as good. The 
      procedure required at average 16 items to assess whether a child has serious 
      problems or not. Agreement of scores on the CAT scales with corresponding CBCL 
      scales was high (range of Spearman correlations 0.59-0.72). Area Under Curves 
      (AUC) were high (range: 0.95-0.97) for the Psycat total, externalizing, and 
      hyperactivity scales using corresponding CBCL scale scores as criterion. For the 
      Psycat internalizing scale the AUC was somewhat lower but still high (0.86). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CAT is a valid procedure for the identification of emotional and 
      behavioral problems in children aged 10-11 years. It may support the efficient 
      and accurate identification of children with overall, and potentially also 
      specific, emotional and behavioral problems in routine PCH.

AB  - Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress 
      is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to 
      develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) 
      based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The 
      first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper 
      and Pencil (P&P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight 
      stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The 
      first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., 
      the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of 
      the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, 
      discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of 
      unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis 
      was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian 
      method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate theta. For the 
      item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each 
      step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, ..., 20, 
      and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 
      0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by 
      using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a 
      receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item 
      bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores 
      were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of 
      the P&P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S (r > 0.5), (4) the 
      value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each 
      stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a 
      highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the 
      theoretically expected advantages, which enabled a rapid, accurate, and efficient 
      dynamic and intelligent measurement of stress.

TI  - Relationship between the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing and legacy instruments in patients undergoing 
      isolated biceps tenodesis.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to correlate the Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive testing (CAT) 
      domains with commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 
      preoperatively in a population of patients presenting to a tertiary care 
      orthopedic center for biceps and labral pathology. METHODS: Prospective data were 
      collected on 175 patients scheduled to undergo isolated biceps tenodesis at a 
      tertiary center. Enrollees completed legacy scores (Veterans RAND 12-Item Health 
      Survey, Short Form 12, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] Assessment 
      Form, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and Constant-Murley score) and PROMIS 
      CAT questionnaires (Upper Extremity [UE], Pain Interference [PIF], and 
      Depression). In addition, patients were asked to provide an assessment of the 
      strength, function, and pain of the affected shoulder using a custom visual 
      analog scale (VAS) questionnaire. Spearman rank correlations of the PROMIS CAT 
      with legacy measures and the custom VAS were calculated. Floor and ceiling 
      effects were assessed. RESULTS: The UE CAT yielded moderate correlations with the 
      ASES score (r = 0.57) and the custom VAS strength score (r = 0.50-0.57). The PIF 
      CAT demonstrated moderate correlations with the VAS pain score (r = 0.45) and 
      high-moderate correlations with the ASES score, VR6D score, and UE CAT (r = 
      0.61-0.66). The Depression CAT demonstrated high-moderate correlations with the 
      mental health legacy measures (r = -0.64 to -0.61). There was a significant 
      relative floor effect for the Depression CAT at a score of 34.2 (19%). 
      CONCLUSION: The PIF CAT was comparable to the ASES score, the current gold 
      standard. Compared with legacy measures, both the UE CAT and PIF CAT are less 
      burdensome and have few floor or ceiling effects. The PIF CAT may be a viable 
      alternative to describe the physical and psychosocial impact of pain in biceps 
      tenodesis patients.

TI  - Operative Treatment is Not Associated with More Relief of Depression Symptoms 
      than Nonoperative Treatment in Patients with Common Hand Illness.
PG  - 1319-1329
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000001170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression symptoms are prevalent in the general population, and as 
      many as one in eight patients seeing a hand surgeon may have undiagnosed major 
      depression. It is not clear to what degree lower mood is the consequence or cause 
      of greater symptoms and limitations. If depressive symptoms are a consequence of 
      functional limitations, they might be expected to improve when pathophysiology 
      and impairment are ameliorated. Because surgical treatment is often 
      disease-modifying or salvage, surgery might have a greater impact than 
      nonoperative treatment, which is more often palliative (symptom relieving) than 
      disease-modifying. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) For which hand or wrist conditions are 
      depression symptoms lower after operative compared with nonoperative treatment? 
      (2) Among the subset of patients with the highest depression scores, are 
      depression symptoms lower after operative treatment compared with nonoperative 
      treatment? (3) Among the subset of patients who had nonoperative treatment, are 
      depression symptoms lower after a corticosteroid injection compared with no 
      specific biomedical intervention? METHODS: At an academic orthopaedic department, 
      4452 patients had a new office visit for carpal tunnel syndrome, benign neoplasm, 
      primary hand osteoarthritis, de Quervain's tendinopathy, or trigger digit. We 
      analyzed the 1652 patients (37%) who had a return visit at least 3 months later 
      for the same diagnosis. Patients completed the Patient-reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression computerized adaptive test at 
      every office visit (higher scores indicate more depression symptoms) and PROMIS 
      Pain Interference (higher scores indicates greater hindrance in daily life owing 
      to pain). Patients with a return visit were more likely to have surgical 
      treatment and had greater Pain Interference scores at the first visit. Thirteen 
      percent of patients (221 of 1652) had incomplete or missing scores at the initial 
      visit and 33% (550 of 1652) had incomplete or missing scores at the final return 
      visit. We used multiple imputations to account for missing or incomplete data 
      (imputations = 50). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, we compared 
      the mean change in Depression scores between patients treated operatively and 
      those treated nonoperatively, accounting for PROMIS Pain Interference scores at 
      the first visit, age, gender diagnosis, provider, and treatment duration. A 
      post-hoc power analysis demonstrated that the smallest patient cohort (benign 
      lump, n = 176) provided 99% power (alpha = 0.05) with eight predictor variables to 
      detect a change of 2 points in the PROMIS Depression score (minimally important 
      difference = 3.5). RESULTS: After controlling for potentially confounding 
      variables such as pain interference and age, only carpal tunnel release was 
      associated with a slightly greater decrease in depression symptoms compared with 
      nonoperative treatment (regression coefficient [RC] = -3 [95% confidence interval 
      -6 to -1]; p = 0.006). In patients with the highest PROMIS Depression scores for 
      each diagnosis, operative treatment was not associated with an improvement in 
      depression symptoms (carpal tunnel release: RC = 5 [95% CI -7 to 16]; p = 0.44). 
      Moreover, a corticosteroid injection was not associated with fewer depression 
      symptoms than no biomedical treatment (carpal tunnel release: RC = -3 [95% CI -8 
      to 3]; p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Given that operative treatment of hand pathology 
      is not generally associated with a decrease in depression symptoms, our results 
      support treating comorbid depression as a separate illness rather than as a 
      secondary effect of pain or physical limitations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, 
      therapeutic study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Biopsychosocial factors are associated with patient-reported upper 
      extremity disability; however, their impact on postoperative outcomes remains 
      less clear. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that high levels of 
      preoperative patient-reported upper extremity and psychological disability are 
      associated with lower magnitudes of improvement following trapeziectomy with 
      ligament reconstruction tendon interposition (LRTI). METHODS: Adult patients 
      undergoing LRTI by fellowship-trained hand surgeons between February 2014 and 
      March 2017 were considered for inclusion. Patient-reported outcomes were 
      collected by tablet computer, including the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, 
      Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) Pain Interference (PI) Computer Adaptive Test (CAT), PROMIS 
      Depression CAT, and PROMIS Anxiety CAT. Univariate and multivariable linear 
      regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with QuickDASH 
      improvement. RESULTS: Of 119 included patients, the mean age was 62.7 +/- 7.2 years 
      and 74% were women. At a mean of 14 weeks after surgery, the QuickDASH improved 
      by a mean of -10 +/- 20 points. The QuickDASH improvement was significantly greater 
      for patients with preoperative QuickDASH scores greater than the median (score 
      change, -19 +/- 20) versus those at or below the median (-2 +/- 16), and for patients 
      with preoperative PI CAT scores greater than the median (-17 +/- 21) versus at or 
      below the median (-4 +/- 17). No differences were observed between groups when 
      Anxiety or Depression CAT baseline scores were similarly dichotomized. 
      Multivariable modelling revealed that higher preoperative QuickDASH scores were 
      associated with greater improvement on the QuickDASH; however, no association was 
      observed for preoperative PI CAT, Depression CAT, and Anxiety CAT scores. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher levels of preoperative upper extremity 
      disability experienced more improvement in the early postoperative period 
      following LRTI. Baseline pain interference, depression, and anxiety were not 
      associated with early outcomes. These findings may be useful when identifying 
      patients who may experience the most functional improvement in the immediate 
      postoperative period following LRTI. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic 
      IV.

LID - 3085
AB  - Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is an efficient testing mode, which allows 
      each examinee to answer appropriate items according his or her latent trait 
      level. The implementation of CAT requires a large-scale item pool, and item pool 
      needs to be frequently replenished with new items to ensure test validity and 
      security. Online calibration is a technique to calibrate the parameters of new 
      items in CAT, which seeds new items in the process of answering operational 
      items, and estimates the parameters of new items through the response data of 
      examinees on new items. The most popular estimation methods include one EM cycle 
      method (OEM) and multiple EM cycle method (MEM) under dichotomous item response 
      theory models. This paper extends OEM and MEM to the graded response model (GRM), 
      a popular model for polytomous data with ordered categories. Two simulation 
      studies were carried out to explore online calibration under a variety of 
      conditions, including calibration design, initial item parameter calculation 
      methods, calibration methods, calibration sample size and the number of 
      categories. Results show that the calibration accuracy of new items were 
      acceptable, and which were affected by the interaction of some factors, therefore 
      some conclusions were given.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need for shorter-length assessments that capture patient 
      questionnaire data while attaining high data quality without an undue response 
      burden on patients. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and classification and 
      regression tree (CART) methods have the potential to meet these needs and can 
      offer attractive options to shorten questionnaire lengths. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study was to test whether CAT or CART was best suited to reduce 
      the number of questionnaire items in multiple domains (eg, anxiety, depression, 
      quality of life, and social support) used for a needs assessment procedure (NAP) 
      within the field of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) without the loss of data quality. 
      METHODS: NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation 
      Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a 
      Web-based portal, MyCARDSS, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed 
      based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of 
      sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: With CAT and CART, an overall reduction of 
      36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length, respectively, was achieved, with a mean 
      sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT, 0.777 and 0.877 for 
      classification trees, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the 
      NAP used within the field of CR. CART, however, showed the best performance, with 
      a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP 
      compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge, 
      our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and 
      CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider 
      administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress 
      in multiple domains. For CR professionals, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would 
      provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their 
      patients by providing real-time patient measurements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Outcome measures typically used to evaluate disease modifying 
      therapies (DMTs) provide important information regarding their effects on disease 
      activity, but they do not capture the full impact of living with multiple 
      sclerosis (MS). Patient reported outcome measures (PROs) are increasingly being 
      used to capture an individual's subjective experience of disease. We compared 
      DMTs across a wide range of PRO outcomes in individuals with MS. METHODS: 
      Subjects enrolled in SysteMS completed the computer adaptive testing version of 
      the Neuro-QoL within four weeks of a clinical neurological exam. Neuro-QoL 
      measures included the following 11 health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 
      domains: Ability to participate in Social Roles and Activities, Anxiety, 
      Cognitive Function, Depression, Emotional and Behavioral Dyscontrol, Fatigue, 
      Lower Extremity Function (mobility), Positive Affect and Wellbeing, Satisfaction 
      with Social Roles and Activities, Stigma, and Upper Extremity Function (fine 
      motor). Treatments were grouped based on the three main modes of delivery: 
      injectable, oral and infusion. The three treatment groups were compared using 
      linear regression adjusting for two sets of covariates (set 1: age, sex, disease 
      duration and EDSS; set 2: age, sex, disease duration, EDSS and treatment 
      duration). We also compared the individual treatments using linear regression. 
      RESULTS: After adjusting for the first set of clinical and demographic features 
      of MS, there was a difference between treatment groups for Upper Extremity 
      Function and Stigma. Subjects using injectable treatments reported better 
      functioning in terms of Upper Extremity Function and Stigma than subjects using 
      infusion treatments. In addition, subjects using injectable treatments reported 
      better Upper Extremity Function than subjects treated with oral DMTs. When all 
      individual treatments were compared, interferon-treated subjects reported 
      significantly better functioning in terms of Stigma than natalizumab treated 
      subjects. When further adjusting for time on treatment, the group differences 
      were attenuated and no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We examined 
      differences between MS treatment groups across a wide range of HRQOL outcomes. 
      The results suggest that overall there are few differences between treatments on 
      the physical, cognitive and emotional dimensions of well-being.

TI  - Sensorineural Hearing Loss Diminishes Use of Temporal Envelope Cues: Evidence 
      From Roving-Level Tone-in-Noise Detection.
PG  - 1009-1019
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000822 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study is to understand how listeners with and 
      without sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) use energy and temporal envelope cues 
      to detect tones in noise. Previous studies of low-frequency tone-in-noise 
      detection have shown that when energy cues are made less reliable using a 
      roving-level paradigm, thresholds of listeners with normal hearing (NH) are only 
      slightly increased. This result is consistent with studies demonstrating the 
      importance of temporal envelope cues for masked detection. In contrast, 
      roving-level detection thresholds are more elevated in listeners with SNHL at the 
      test frequency, suggesting stronger weighting of energy cues. The present study 
      extended these tests to a wide range of frequencies and stimulus levels. The 
      authors hypothesized that individual listeners with SNHL use energy and temporal 
      envelope cues differently for masked detection at different frequencies and 
      levels, depending on the degree of hearing loss. DESIGN: Twelve listeners with 
      mild to moderate SNHL and 12 NH listeners participated. Tone-in-noise detection 
      thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in 1/3 octave bands of simultaneously gated 
      Gaussian noise were obtained using a novel, two-part tracking paradigm. A track 
      refers to the sequence of trials in an adaptive test procedure; the signal to 
      noise ratio was the tracked variable. Each part of the track consisted of a 
      two-alternative, two-interval, forced-choice procedure. The initial portion of 
      the track estimated detection threshold using a fixed masker level. When the 
      track continued, stimulus levels were randomly varied over a 20-dB rove range 
      (+/-10 dB with respect to mean masker level), and a second threshold was estimated. 
      Rove effect (RE) was defined as the difference between thresholds for the fixed- 
      and roving-level tests. The size of the RE indicated how strongly a listener 
      weighted energy-based cues for masked detection. Participants were tested at one 
      to three masker levels per frequency, depending on audibility. RESULTS: Across 
      all stimulus frequencies and levels, NH listeners had small REs ( approximately 1 dB), whereas 
      listeners with SNHL typically had larger REs. Some listeners with SNHL had larger 
      REs at higher frequencies, where pure-tone audiometric thresholds were typically 
      elevated. RE did not vary significantly with masker level for either group. 
      Increased RE for the SNHL group was consistent with simulations in which energy 
      cues were more heavily weighted than envelope cues. CONCLUSIONS: Tone-in-noise 
      detection thresholds in NH listeners were typically elevated only slightly by the 
      roving-level paradigm at any frequency or level tested, consistent with the 
      primary use of level-independent cues, such as temporal envelope cues that are 
      conveyed by fluctuations in neural responses. In comparison, thresholds of 
      listeners with SNHL were more affected by the roving-level paradigm, suggesting 
      stronger weighting of energy cues. For listeners with SNHL, the largest RE was 
      observed at 4000 Hz, for which pure-tone audiometric thresholds were most 
      elevated. Specifically, RE size at 4000 Hz was significantly correlated with 
      higher pure-tone audiometric thresholds at the same frequency, after controlling 
      for the effect of age. Future studies will explore strategies for restoring or 
      enhancing neural fluctuation cues that may lead to improved hearing in noise for 
      listeners with SNHL.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prospectively study the clinical and developmental profile; 
      hematological profile and the B-12 status using multiple parameters in children 
      with Infantile tremor syndrome (ITS). METHODS: In this observational 
      study (NCT02762682) (July 2015 through December 2016) children (and their 
      mothers) with a clinical diagnosis of ITS were evaluated clinically; and 
      development was assessed by CAPUTE scales. A complete blood count (CBC); 
      peripheral blood smear examination; markers of vitamin B12 status (serum B12, 
      homocysteine, folate); acylcarnitines [using Tandem mass spectrometry (TMS)] and 
      urine methylmalonic acid (MMA) [Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS)] were 
      estimated. A control group of children and their mothers were sampled for 
      comparison. RESULTS: A total of 286 individuals were enrolled for this study. 
      One-hundred-ten children with ITS were screened and 92 (20 with tremors; age 
      12.7 +/- 5 mo, 61 boys) children and their mothers were enrolled. Fifty-one 
      children and their mothers were enrolled as controls. The median clinical 
      linguistic & auditory milestone-developmental quotient (CLAM-DQ) was 32 (IQR 
      20.6-45.5) and median cognitive adaptive test-developmental quotient (CAT-DQ) was 
      36.2 (IQR 18.7-49.0). All babies except 9 (ovo-veg) had vegetarian mothers. Head 
      circumference below 2 SD (WHO standards) was seen in 84% and below 3 SD in 58%. 
      The CBC findings were; Hb- 8.3 +/- 1.6 g/dl, Thrombocytopenia-29 (32%), mean 
      corpuscular volume (MCV)- 92.2 +/- 13.4, MCV- more than 95 fL-38(42%), Red cell 
      distribution width (RDW)- 21.6 +/- 6.5, and macrocytes on peripheral smear in 68%. 
      In 89 (97%) out of 92 children had laboratory features of deficient B12 status. 
      Two-thirds of the mothers also had evidence of B12 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: ITS 
      is, in all likelihood is a consequence of vitamin B12 defeciency. It has a 
      significant impact on head growth and development of affected infants.

LID - 10.1037/rep0000302 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently 
      experience anxiety related to the caregiver role. Often this is due to a 
      caregiver's perceived need to avoid people and situations that might upset or 
      "trigger" the care recipient. There are currently no self-report measures that 
      capture these feelings; thus, this article describes the development and 
      preliminary validation efforts for the TBI-Caregiver Quality of Life (CareQOL) 
      Caregiver Vigilance item bank. DESIGN: A sample of 532 caregivers of civilians (n 
      = 218) or service members/veterans (SMVs; n = 314) with TBI completed 32 
      caregiver vigilance items, other measures of health-related quality of life 
      (RAND-12, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] 
      Depression, PROMIS Social Isolation, Caregiver Appraisal Scale), and the 
      Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4. RESULTS: The final item bank contains 18 
      items, as supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, item 
      response theory graded response modeling (GRM), and differential item functioning 
      investigations. Expert review and GRM calibration data informed the selection of 
      a 6-item short form and programming of a computer adaptive test. Internal 
      consistency reliability for the different administration formats were excellent 
      (reliability coefficients >/= .90). Three-week test-retest stability was supported 
      (i.e., r >/= .78). Correlations between vigilance and other self-report measures 
      supported convergent and discriminant validity (0.01 </= r </= .69). Known-groups 
      validity was also supported. CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Vigilance 
      computer adaptive test and corresponding 6-item short form were developed using 
      established rigorous measurement development standards, providing the first 
      self-report measure to evaluate caregiver vigilance. This development work 
      indicates that this measure exhibits strong psychometric properties. (PsycInfo

TI  - Development of a computerized adaptive substance use disorder scale for screening 
      and measurement: the CAT-SUD.
PG  - 1382-1394
LID - 10.1111/add.14938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance 
      use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multi-dimensional item 
      response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric 
      harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, 
      functional impairment and risk-taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more 
      balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the item-bank, (2) calibrate 
      the item-bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and 
      symptom-specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing 
      (CAT) and (4) validate the CAT-SUD in Spanish and English in the United States 
      and Spain. DESIGN: Item bank construction, item calibration phase, CAT-SUD 
      validation phase. SETTING: Primary care, community clinics, emergency departments 
      and patient-to-patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United 
      States (Boston and Los Angeles). PARTICIPANTS/CASES: Calibration phase: the 
      CAT-SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 
      participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite 
      International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CAT-SUD. MEASUREMENTS: A total 
      of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) 
      risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CAT-SUD scale 
      scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis. FINDINGS: Calibration: the bifactor model provided 
      excellent fit to the multi-dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings 
      (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 
      11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden 
      (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation 
      of 0.91 with the 168-item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale). 
      VALIDATION: strong agreement was found between the primary CAT-SUD dimension 
      estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20-fold 
      increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the 
      CAT-SUD (AUC = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new approach for the 
      screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multi-dimensional 
      item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental 
      health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more 
      complete characterization of SUD. The CAT-SUD is highly predictive of a current 
      SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of 
      the development of SUD in the future.

TI  - TBI-CareQOL military health care frustration in caregivers of service 
      members/veterans with traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 360-376
LID - 10.1037/rep0000305 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Caregivers of service members/veterans (SMVs) encounter a number of 
      barriers when navigating the military health care system. The purpose of this 
      study was to develop a new measure to assess potential caregiver frustration with 
      the systems of care and benefits in the United States Departments of Defense and 
      Veterans Affairs. METHOD: The TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration 
      measure was developed using data from 317 caregivers of SMVs with TBI who 
      completed an item pool comprised of 64 questions pertaining to anger or 
      frustration with accessing military health care services. RESULTS: Exploratory 
      and confirmatory factor analyses supported the retention of 58 items. Constrained 
      graded response model (GRM) overall fit and item fit analyses and differential 
      item functioning investigations of age and education factors supported the 
      retention of 43 items in the final measure. Expert review and GRM item 
      calibration products were used to inform the selection of two 6-item static short 
      forms (TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration-Self; TBI-CareQOL Military 
      Health Care Frustration-Person with TBI) and to program the TBI-CareQOL Military 
      Health Care Frustration computer adaptive test (CAT). Preliminary data supported 
      the reliability (i.e., internal consistency and test-retest reliability) as well 
      as the validity (i.e., convergent, discriminant, and known-groups) of the new 
      measure. CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Military Health Care Frustration 
      measure can be used to examine caregiver perceptions of and experience with the 
      military health care system, to target improvements. (PsycInfo Database Record

TI  - Psychometric Properties of the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory in a Nationally 
      Representative Sample of Youth.
PG  - 596-608
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2019.1703710 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant 
      questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS(R)) Scientific Standards and refined through factor 
      analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to 
      improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum 
      disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI's psychometric properties and to 
      establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth.Methods: Data were 
      collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to 
      the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. 
      Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded 
      response model were performed to evaluate the EDI's structure and psychometric 
      properties.Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the 
      EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized 
      adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as 
      those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric 
      analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation 
      and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales 
      provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity 
      was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and 
      expected known-group differences.Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise 
      measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical 
      samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

TI  - The impact of a patient's engagement in their health on the magnitude of 
      limitations and experience following upper limb fractures.
PG  - 42-47
LID - 10.1302/0301-620X.102B1.BJJ-2019-0421.R1 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Patient engagement in adaptive health behaviours and interactions with 
      their healthcare ecosystem can be measured using self-reported instruments, such 
      as the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) and the Effective Consumer Scale 
      (ECS-17). Few studies have investigated the influence of patient engagement on 
      limitations (patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)) and patient-reported 
      experience measures (PREMs). First, we assessed whether patient engagement 
      (PAM-13, ECS-17) within two to four weeks of an upper limb fracture was 
      associated with limitations (the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
      questionnaire (QuickDASH), and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information 
      System Upper Extremity Physical Function computer adaptive test (PROMIS UE PF) 
      scores) measured six to nine months after fracture, accounting for demographic, 
      clinical, and psychosocial factors. Secondly, we assessed the association between 
      patient engagement and experience (numerical rating scale for satisfaction with 
      care (NRS-C) and satisfaction with services (NRS-S) six to nine months after 
      fracture. METHODS: A total of 744 adults with an isolated fracture of the 
      proximal humerus, elbow, or distal radius completed PROMs. Due to 
      multicollinearity of patient engagement and psychosocial variables, we generated 
      a single variable combining measures of engagement and psychosocial factors using 
      factor analysis. We then performed multivariable analysis with p < 0.10 on 
      bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Patient engagement and psychosocial factors combined 
      to form a single factor (factor 1) accounting for 20% (QuickDASH, semi-partial 
      R(2) = 0.20) and 14% (PROMIS UE PF, semi-partial R(2) = 0.14) of the variation in 
      limitations six to nine months after fracture. Factor 1 also accounted for 17% 
      (NRS-C, semi-partial R(2) = 0.17) of variation in satisfaction with care, and 21% 
      (NRS-S, semi-partial R(2) = 0.21) of variation in satisfaction with services. 
      Demographic factors (age, sex, work status) and measures of greater 
      pathophysiology (type of fracture, high-energy injury, post-surgical 
      complications), accounted for much less variation. CONCLUSION: Patients who 
      actively manage their health and demonstrate effective emotional and social 
      functioning share a common underlying trait. They have fewer limitations and 
      greater satisfaction with care during recovery from upper limb fractures. Future 
      efforts should focus on evaluating initiatives that optimize patient engagement, 
      such as patient education, coaching, and a communication strategy for healthcare 
      professionals. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2020;102-B(1):42-47.

TI  - Preoperative Performance of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System in Patients with Meniscal Root Tears.
PG  - 913-917
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-3402076 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish preoperative validity of the 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function 
      computer adaptive test (PROMIS PF-CT) with legacy patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) for meniscal root tears (MRTs). Our study included 51 patients 
      (52 knees) with MRT. Patients completed PROMIS PF-CT, Short Form 36 (SF-36 
      physical function, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional 
      well-being, role limitations due to physical health, and role limitations due to 
      emotional problems), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS pain, 
      symptoms, activities of daily living [ADLs], sports, and quality of life [QOL]), 
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC pain, 
      stiffness, and function), EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), and Knee Activity Scale 
      questionnaires at their preoperative visit. Correlations between the PROMs listed 
      above were evaluated along with floor and ceiling effects. Correlations were 
      defined as weak (0.2-0.39), moderate (0.4-0.59), strong (0.6-0.79), and very 
      strong (0.8-1.0). Preoperative data showed that PROMIS PF-CT has a strong 
      correlation with SF-36 PF, KOOS-ADL, WOMAC-function, and EQ-5D; and moderate 
      correlation with KOOS-sport, KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-QOL, WOMAC-pain, and 
      WOMAC-stiffness. The Knee Activity Scale did not show any significant correlation 
      with PROMIS PF-CT (r = 0.12, p = 0.2080). Of all the PROMs administered, PROMIS 
      PF-CT demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects compared with 11.54% ceiling 
      effect in KOOS-sports, and 5.77% floor effect in KOOS-ADL. On average, patients 
      answered fewer PROMIS PF-CT questions (4.15 +/- 0.72). PROMIS PF-CT is a valuable 
      tool to assess preoperative patient-reported physical function in patients that 
      may undergo MRT repair. It correlates strongly with other well-established PROMs. 
      It also demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects and demonstrated a low test 
      burden in our sample of 52 knees. This is a level III, prognostic retrospective 
      comparative study.

TI  - A Blocked-CAT Procedure for CD-CAT.
PG  - 49-64
LID - 10.1177/0146621619835500 [doi]
AB  - This article introduces a blocked-design procedure for cognitive diagnosis 
      computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT), which allows examinees to review items 
      and change their answers during test administration. Four blocking versions of 
      the new procedure were proposed. In addition, the impact of several factors, 
      namely, item quality, generating model, block size, and test length, on the 
      classification rates was investigated. Three popular item selection indices in 
      CD-CAT were used and their efficiency compared using the new procedure. An 
      additional study was carried out to examine the potential benefit of item review. 
      The results showed that the new procedure is promising in that allowing item 
      review resulted only in a small loss in attribute classification accuracy under 
      some conditions. Moreover, using a blocked-design CD-CAT is beneficial to the 
      extent that it alleviates the negative impact of test anxiety on examinees' true 
      performance.

TI  - Reliability and validity data to support the clinical utility of the Traumatic 
      Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL).
PG  - 323-336
LID - 10.1037/rep0000295 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) is 
      a patient-reported outcome measurement system that is specific to caregivers of 
      civilians and service members/veterans (SMVs) with traumatic brain injury (TBI). 
      This measurement system includes 26 item banks that represent both generic (i.e., 
      borrowed from existing measurement systems) and caregiver-specific components of 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This report provides reliability and 
      validity data for measures within the TBI-CareQOL that have not previously been 
      reported (i.e., 4 caregiver-specific and 7 generic measures of HRQOL). DESIGN: 
      Three hundred eighty-five caregivers of persons with TBI completed 
      caregiver-specific computer adaptive tests (CATs) for Feelings of Loss-Self, 
      Caregiver Strain, Caregiver-Specific Anxiety, and Feeling Trapped, as well as 
      generic measures of HRQOL from complementary measurement systems (i.e., Neuro-QoL 
      Positive Affect and Well-Being; PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment; NIH Toolbox 
      Perceived Stress, General Life Satisfaction, and Self Efficacy; TBI-QOL 
      Resilience and Grief/Loss). Caregivers also completed several additional measures 
      to establish convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the Mayo Portland 
      Adaptability Index, 4th ed. RESULTS: Findings support the internal consistency 
      reliability (all alphas > .85) and test-retest stability (all alphas >.73) of the 
      TBI-CareQOL measures. Convergent validity was supported by moderate to high 
      correlations between the TBI-CareQOL measures and related measures, whereas 
      discriminant validity was supported by low correlations between the TBI-CareQOL 
      measures and unrelated constructs. Known-groups validity was also supported. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the reliability and validity of the item banks that 
      comprise the TBI-CareQOL Measurement System. These measures should be considered 
      for any standardized assessment of HRQOL in caregivers of civilians and SMVs with 
      TBI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), 
      machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, 
      Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused 
      a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore 
      how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of 
      smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also 
      investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. METHOD: Student nurses 
      recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the 
      screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression 
      care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) 
      for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, 
      reliability, risk) were investigated. RESULTS: We recorded 1216 observations for 
      the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the 
      CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas 
      respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they 
      did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate 
      diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they 
      would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, 
      but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic 
      relationship. CONCLUSION: This was the first study assessing student nurses' 
      views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested 
      in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our 
      study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these 
      devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup 
      analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic 
      profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive 
      training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.

TI  - Optimizing measurement of vision-related quality of life: a computerized adaptive 
      test for the impact of vision impairment questionnaire (IVI-CAT).
PG  - 765-774
LID - 10.1007/s11136-019-02354-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the results from a simulated computerized adaptive test (CAT) 
      for the 28-item Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire and the original 
      paper-pencil version in terms of efficiency (main outcome), defined as percentage 
      item reduction. METHODS: Using paper-pencil IVI data from 832 participants across 
      the spectrum of vision impairment, item calibrations of the 28-item IVI 
      instrument and its associated 20-item vision-specific functioning (VSF) and 
      8-item emotional well-being (EWB) subscales were generated with Rasch analysis. 
      Based on these calibrations, CAT simulations were conducted on 1000 cases, with 
      'high' and 'moderate' precision stopping rules (standard error of measurement 
      [SEM] 0.387 and 0.521, respectively). We examined the average number of items 
      needed to satisfy the stopping rules and the corresponding percentage item 
      reduction, level of agreement between person measures estimated from the full IVI 
      item bank and from the CAT simulations, and item exposure rates (IER). RESULTS: 
      For the overall IVI-CAT, 5 or 9.7 items were required, on average, to obtain 
      moderate or high precision estimates of vision-related quality of life, 
      corresponding to 82.1 and 65.4% item reductions compared to the paper-pencil IVI. 
      Agreement was high between the person measures generated from the full IVI item 
      bank and the IVI-CAT for both the high precision simulation (mean bias, - 0.004 
      logits; 95% LOA - 0.594 to 0.587) and moderate precision simulation (mean bias, 
      0.014 logits; 95% LOA - 0.828 to 0.855). The IER for the IVI-CAT in the moderate 
      precision simulation was skewed, with six EWB items used > 40% of the time. 
      CONCLUSION: Compared to the paper-pencil IVI instrument, the IVI-CATs required 
      fewer items without loss of measurement precision, making them potentially 
      attractive outcome instruments for implementation into clinical trials, 
      healthcare, and research. Final versions of the IVI-CATs are available.

TI  - Does Intolerance of Uncertainty Affect the Magnitude of Limitations or Pain 
      Intensity?
PG  - 381-388
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000001042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intolerance of uncertainty-the tendency to overestimate the chance of 
      and be unwilling to accept potential, but unlikely, negative outcomes in 
      uncertain situations-is a cognitive construct that has been shown to affect 
      symptoms and limitations for patients with traumatic and nontraumatic 
      upper-extremity conditions. Cognitive flexibility and tolerance of uncertainty 
      can be trained and practiced, with the potential to increase musculoskeletal 
      health. However, to our knowledge, the degree to which intolerance of uncertainty 
      might be associated with symptom intensity and the magnitude of limitations in 
      adults with upper-extremity problems has not been characterized. 
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: After accounting for personal and social factors, is 
      intolerance of uncertainty independently associated with (1) the magnitude of 
      physical limitations and (2) pain intensity? METHODS: In this cross-sectional, 
      observational study, 139 new and returning patients presenting to one of four 
      orthopaedic offices in a large urban area completed the Intolerance of 
      Uncertainty Scale (a validated measure of the level of comfort with uncertain 
      situations), the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System-Physical Function Upper Extremity computer adaptive test (to measure the 
      magnitude of limitations), and an 11-point ordinal measure of pain intensity. The 
      mean age of the 139 participants was 51 years +/- 16 years and 55% (76 of 139) were 
      men. Participants presented to the clinics with a wide variety of upper-extremity 
      conditions, such as trigger finger, distal radius fractures, lateral 
      epicondylitis, or non-specific shoulder pain. We also assessed sex, race, marital 
      status, education level, income, public versus private insurance, area 
      deprivation index, and the participant's self-perception of their healthcare 
      experience through a multiple-choice question (answer choices: none, some, a 
      little, and a lot of experience). The following patient characteristics were more 
      common in our study participants: white, employed, part of a married or unmarried 
      couple, and private insurance coverage. We created two multivariable linear 
      regression models to assess factors independently associated with the magnitude 
      of limitations and pain intensity. RESULTS: After controlling for potentially 
      confounding variables including sex, insurance, area deprivation index, and type 
      of visit, we found that fewer physical limitations were associated with a greater 
      intolerance of uncertainty (regression coefficient [beta] -0.30; 95% confidence 
      interval, -0.50 to -0.10; p = 0.003; semi-partial r = 0.07; adjusted r for the 
      full model = 0.16), as was being a man (beta 3.2; 95% CI, 0.08-6.3; p = 0.045; 
      semi-partial r = 0.03) and having private insurance coverage (beta 5.2; 95% CI, 
      2.1-8.2; p = 0.001; semi-partial r = 0.08). After controlling for one important 
      potentially confounding variable, the level of education, greater pain intensity 
      was associated with a greater intolerance of uncertainty (beta 0.08; 95% CI, 
      0.02-0.14; p = 0.009; semi-partial r = 0.05; adjusted r for the full model = 
      0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Intolerance of uncertainty-a byproduct of cognitive bias and 
      error, which are elements of the normal functioning of the human mind-increases 
      limitations and pain intensity across diagnoses, independent of demographic and 
      social factors. Future studies can address the effect of strategies that 
      incorporate mindset training (for example, cognitive behavioral therapy and its 
      derivatives) on musculoskeletal symptoms and limitations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - Glaucoma, an irreversible blinding condition affecting 3-4% adults aged above 40 
      years worldwide, is set to increase with a rapidly aging global population. 
      Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma where the 
      treatment paradigm is focused on managing IOP using medications, laser, or 
      surgery regimens. However, notwithstanding IOP and other clinical parameters, 
      patient-reported outcomes, including daily functioning, emotional well-being, 
      symptoms, mobility, and social life, remain the foremost concerns for people 
      being treated for glaucoma. These outcomes are measured using objective 
      patient-centered outcome measures (PCOMs) and subjective patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs). Studies using PCOMs have shown that people with glaucoma have 
      several mobility, navigational and coordination challenges; reading and face 
      recognition deficits; and are slower in adapting to multiple real-world 
      situations when compared to healthy controls. Similarly, studies have 
      consistently demonstrated, using PROMs, that glaucoma substantially and 
      negatively impacts on peoples' self-reported visual functioning, mobility, 
      independence, emotional well-being, self-image, and confidence in healthcare, 
      compared to healthy individuals, particularly in those with late-stage disease 
      undergoing a heavy treatment regimen. The patient-centred effectiveness of 
      current glaucoma treatment paradigms is equivocal due to a lack of well-designed 
      randomized controlled trials; short post-treatment follow-up periods; an 
      inappropriate selection or availability of PROMs; and/or an insensitivity of 
      currently available PROMs to monitor changes especially in patients with newly 
      diagnosed early-stage glaucoma. We provide a comprehensive, albeit 
      non-systematic, critique of the psychometric properties, limitations, and recent 
      advances of currently available glaucoma-specific PCOMs and PROMs. Finally, we 
      propose that item banking and computerized adaptive testing methods can address 
      the multiple limitations of paper-pencil PROMs; customize their administration; 
      and have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for people with glaucoma.

TI  - Responsiveness of PROMIS(R) to change in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1186/s41687-019-0155-9 [doi]
LID - 65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive chronic 
      disease characterized by airflow obstruction that leads to shortness of breath 
      and substantial negative impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQL). The 
      course of COPD includes periodic acute exacerbations that require changes in 
      treatment and/or hospitalizations. This study was designed to examine the 
      responsiveness of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System(R) 
      (PROMIS(R)) measures to changes associated with COPD exacerbation recovery. 
      METHODS: A longitudinal analysis using mixed-effects models was conducted of 
      people who were enrolled while stable (n = 100) and those who experienced an 
      acute exacerbation (n = 85). PROMIS (physical function, pain interference, pain 
      behavior, fatigue, anxiety, depression, anger, social roles, discretionary social 
      activities, Global Health, dyspnea severity and dyspnea functional limitations) 
      and COPD-targeted HRQL measures were completed at baseline and at 12 weeks. 
      RESULTS: We administered PROMIS measures using computer adaptive testing (CAT), 
      followed by administration of any remaining short form (SF) items that had not 
      yet been administered by CAT. Examination of the difference between group 
      differences from baseline to 12 weeks in the stable and exacerbation groups 
      revealed that the exacerbation group changed (improved) significantly more than 
      the stable group in anxiety (p < .001 to p < .01; f(2) effect size 
      [ES] = 0.023/0.021), fatigue (p < .0001; ES = 0.036/0.047) and social roles 
      (p < .001 to p < .05; ES = 0.035/0.024). All effect sizes were small in magnitude 
      and smaller than hypothesized. Depression was also statistically significant 
      (p < .05, SF only) but the ES was trivial. For all other PROMIS domains, the 
      differences were not significant and ES were trivial. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      longitudinal study provides some support for the validity of the PROMIS fatigue, 
      anxiety, and social roles domains in COPD, but further evaluation of 
      responsiveness is warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe a three-phase implementation of the International 
      Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Depression and Anxiety Standard Set in 
      a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry practice. METHODS: During the preintervention 
      phase, we reviewed patient-reported outcome tools and engaged stakeholders and 
      leadership. During phase 1, the standard set was converted into an electronic 
      previsit intake assessment that was implemented in a physician champion's 
      practice. Patients completed the intake on a tablet, and computer adaptive 
      testing was used to reduce response burden. Physician-facing data display 
      facilitated use during subsequent in-person visits. An electronic version of the 
      follow-up standard set was used during follow-up visits. During phase 2, a second 
      physician tested scalability and the intervention was disseminated department 
      wide in phase 3. RESULTS: During phase 1, 186 intakes and 67 follow-up electronic 
      patient-reported outcome sets were completed. Average patient age was 54 years, 
      and 44% were male. On average, patients ranked the tool 4.4 out of 5 and spent 22 
      minutes completing the intake. Time-driven activity-based costing found the new 
      process to be cost-effective. During phase 2, 386 patients completed electronic 
      patient-reported outcome sets, with 315 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the 
      tool as 4.0 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes completing the questions. During phase 
      3, 2166 patients completed intake electronic patient-reported outcome sets and 
      1249 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the tool 4.3 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes 
      on it. Scores and completion time did not differ greatly between phases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Integration of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes 
      Measurement Depression and Anxiety Standard Set is feasible. Future research 
      comparing International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement set with other 
      approaches and in different settings is needed.

AB  - There is limited validated data regarding the relationship between preoperative 
      expectations and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients undergoing knee 
      surgery. The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the preoperative 
      expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery and (2) determine the 
      relationship between preoperative patient demographics, PROs, and preoperative 
      patient expectations. We hypothesized that younger patients with worse function 
      and worse general health status would have greater expectations of knee surgery. 
      We analyzed data from 399 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic 
      medical center. We utilized the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and 
      Management System to measure preoperative expectations. Multiple legacy PRO 
      measures were recorded, as well as the new Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information Systems (PROMIS) Computer Adaptive Testing. Nonparametric statistical 
      analyses were performed to determine significance. Overall, patients undergoing 
      knee surgery had high expectations, with a mean of 88.0 (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 86.7-89.3) and median of 91.7 (95% CI, 89.2-94.3). Greater preoperative 
      expectations of knee surgery were associated with higher income, surgically naive 
      knee, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, better PROMIS Depression and Anxiety 
      scores, greater Marx knee activity scores, and lower total body pain (p < 0.05). 
      Preoperative expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery are associated with 
      a history of prior knee surgery, income, general and mental health, activity, and 
      pain. Expectations were also found to be associated with PRO measures of function 
      and psychological well-being. These findings may have implications for patient 
      education and shared decision-making preoperatively. The level of evidence for 
      the study is IV.

TI  - Psychometric Properties of the Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System Item Banks in a Dutch Clinical Sample of Children With 
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of 8 pediatric Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) item banks in a clinical sample 
      of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: A total of 154 
      Dutch children (mean +/- SD age 14.4 +/- 3.0 years; range 8-18 years) with JIA 
      completed 8 pediatric version 1.0 PROMIS item banks (anger, anxiety, depressive 
      symptoms, fatigue, pain interference, peer relationships, physical function 
      mobility, physical function upper extremity) twice and the Pediatric Quality of 
      Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ) 
      once. Structural validity of the item banks was assessed by fitting a graded 
      response model (GRM) and inspecting GRM fit (comparative fit index [CFI], 
      Tucker-Lewis index [TLI], and root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]) 
      and item fit (S-X(2) statistic). Convergent validity (with PedsQL/C-HAQ 
      subdomains) and discriminative validity (active/inactive disease) were assessed. 
      Reliability of the item banks, short forms, and computerized adaptive testing 
      (CAT) was expressed as the SE of theta (SE[theta]). Test-retest reliability was 
      assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and smallest detectable 
      change. RESULTS: All item banks had sufficient overall GRM fit (CFI >0.95, TLI 
      >0.95, RMSEA <0.08) and no item misfit (all S-X(2) P > 0.001). High correlations 
      (>0.70) were found between most PROMIS T scores and hypothesized PedsQL/C-HAQ 
      (sub)domains. Mobility, pain interference, and upper extremity item banks were 
      able to discriminate between patients with active and inactive disease. Regarding 
      reliability, PROMIS item banks outperformed legacy instruments. Post hoc CAT 
      simulations outperformed short forms. Test-retest reliability was strong (ICC 
      >0.70) for all full-length item banks and short forms, except for the peer 
      relationships item bank. CONCLUSION: The pediatric PROMIS item banks displayed 
      sufficient psychometric properties for Dutch children with JIA. PROMIS item banks 
      are ready for use in clinical research and practice for children with JIA.

      Item Banks.
PG  - 448-458
LID - 10.1080/09286586.2019.1678655 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: We are developing item banks assessing the impact of retinal and 
      vitreoretinal diseases (excluding age-related macular degeneration, diabetic 
      retinopathy, and retinal detachment, covered elsewhere) on quality of life (QoL) 
      for adults. This study outlines the first two phases of the multi-stage process: 
      content development and item evaluation.Methods: We grouped retinal and 
      vitreoretinal diseases into hereditary and acquired. Development of the item 
      banks involved two phases: item identification and item evaluation. The items 
      were extracted from three sources: (1) 17 pre-existing PRO instruments, (2) 4 
      qualitative studies and (3) 79 semi-structured interviews. Item evaluation 
      involved three stages namely, binning (grouping) and winnowing (reduction), 
      expert panel opinion and cognitive interviews.Results: The item identification 
      phase yielded 1,217 items. After three sessions of binning and winnowing, items 
      were reduced to a minimally representative set (n = 411) across nine QoL domains 
      namely, activity limitation, emotional, social, health concerns, symptoms, 
      economic, mobility, convenience, and coping. The hereditary group had a total of 
      345 items and the acquired group had a total of 257 items. After 23 cognitive 
      interviews items were amended for hereditary diseases resulting in a final set of 
      345 items and 3 items were amended for acquired diseases, resulting in a final 
      set of 254 items. Overall across nine domains 189 items were common to hereditary 
      and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.Conclusion: As most of the items 
      were unique to hereditary versus acquired retinal and vitreoretinal disease 
      groups separate item banks are required to capture the QoL impacts for hereditary 
      and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcome Measures and Patient Activation: What Are Their Roles in 
      Orthopedic Trauma?
PG  - S38-S42
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0000000000001612 [doi]
AB  - The rise of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement across medicine has been 
      swift and now extends to the world of orthopedic trauma. However, PRO measures 
      (PROMs) applied to trauma patients pose special considerations; measuring 
      "episodes of care" is less straightforward, injuries are heterogeneous in their 
      severity, and the patient's initial visit is "postinjury." Obtaining baseline 
      scores and assessing the impact of a traumatic event on mental health are key 
      considerations. Currently, few, if any, trauma registries include PROs; though 
      general and condition-specific PROMs plus the patient empowerment measure of 
      Patient Activation represent meaningful inputs for the clinical decision-making 
      process. To be useful in trauma care, PROMs should be psychometrically sound and 
      validated, be used for capturing function, screen for mental state and substance 
      use, and give the clinician a sense of the patient's "activation" (engagement in 
      their own health). Although the implementation of routine PRO collection can seem 
      daunting, clinicians can use a multitude of electronic resources to access 
      validated measures and simplify the implementation process. Computer-adaptive 
      testing has evolved to help minimize patient burden, and PROM collection must 
      maximize efficiency. Once established as part of your practice, PROs become an 
      important tool to track recovery, identify mental health issues, engage in the 
      prevention of future injury, and enable care of the whole patient.

      tests (CATs) or short forms (SFs) of varying length (e.g., 4, 6, and 8 items). We 
      compared the accuracy and number of items administrated of CAT versus each SF. 
      METHODS: PROMIS instruments are scored using item response theory (IRT) with 
      graded response model and reported as T scores (mean = 50, SD = 10). We simulated 
      10,000 subjects from the normal distribution with mean 60 for symptom scales and 
      40 for function scales, and standard deviation 10 in each domain. We considered a 
      subject's score to be accurate when the standard error (SE) was less than 3.0. We 
      recorded range of accurate scores (accurate range) and the number of items 
      administrated. RESULTS: The average number of items administrated in CAT was 4.7 
      across all domains. The accurate range was wider for CAT compared to all SFs in 
      each domain. CAT was notably better at extending the accurate range into very 
      poor health for Fatigue, Physical Function, and Pain Interference. Most SFs 
      provided reasonably wide accurate range. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to SFs, CATs 
      provided the widest accurate range, with slightly more items than SF4 and less 
      than SF6 and SF8. Most SFs, especially longer ones, provided reasonably wide 
      accurate range.

TI  - Measuring emotional suppression in caregivers of adults with traumatic brain 
      injury.
PG  - 455-470
LID - 10.1037/rep0000291 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often feel 
      pressure to maintain the appearance that they are emotionally well adjusted, 
      despite feelings to the contrary. Because there are currently no measures 
      examining this construct, this article focuses on the development of a new 
      measure that is specific to caregivers of people with TBI. DESIGN: A total of 533 
      caregivers of civilians with TBI (n = 218) or service members/veterans (SMVs) 
      with TBI (n = 315) completed 43 emotional suppression items, as well as other 
      patient-reported outcomes and an estimate of the functional ability of the person 
      with TBI. RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the 
      retention of 25 items. Graded response model (GRM) analyses and differential item 
      functioning (DIF) studies supported the retention of 21 items in the final 
      measure. Expert review and GRM calibration data were used to develop a 6-item 
      static short form (SF) and program a computer adaptive test (CAT). Internal 
      consistency was excellent for both the CAT and SF (reliabilities >/= 0.91); 3-week 
      test-retest stability was good (all intraclass correlations >/= 0.89). Convergent 
      validity was supported by moderate associations between TBI-CareQOL Emotional 
      Suppression and related measures (rs from 0.47 to 0.59); discriminant validity 
      was supported by small correlations between Emotional Suppression and positive 
      aspects of caregiving and physical health (rs from 0.14 to 0.28). Known-groups 
      validity was also supported. CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Emotional 
      Suppression CAT and 6-item short form is the first self-report measure of this 
      construct in this population. Our findings suggest this new measure has strong 
      psychometric properties. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Liver transplantation candidates are among the most 
      comorbid patients awaiting lifesaving intervention. Health related quality of 
      life (HRQOL) measured by instruments that incorporate dynamic computerized 
      adaptive testing, could improve their assessment. We aimed to determine the 
      feasibility of administration of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS-CAT) in liver transplant candidates. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Liver transplantation candidates were prospectively enrolled following a 
      review of their available medical history. Subjects were given a tablet computer 
      (iPad) to access the pre-loaded PROMIS CAT. RESULTS: 109 candidates with mean age 
      55.6+/-8.6 years were enrolled in this pilot study. Mean MELD-Na score was 
      16.3+/-6.3; 92.6% had decompensated liver disease. Leading etiologies of cirrhosis 
      included hepatitis C (34.8%), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (25.7%) and alcohol 
      (21.1%). Subjects with MELD-Na score>20 had the most significant impairment in 
      HRQOL (anxiety/fear+5.9+/-2.7, p=0.0289, depression+5.1+/-2.5, p=0.0428, 
      fatigue+4.3+/-2.6, p=0.0973) and physical impairment (-7.8+/-2.5, p=0.0022). Stage of 
      cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease were predictive of impaired HRQOL but 
      Child-Pugh Turcotte score was not. Hepatic encephalopathy was the strongest 
      independent predictor of impaired HRQOL, with significant impairment across all 
      domains of health. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant candidates have significantly 
      impaired HRQOL across multiple domains of health as measured by PROMIS-CAT. HRQOL 
      impairment parallels disease severity. Future study is needed to determine how 
      best HRQOL could be systematically included in liver transplantation listing 
      policy, especially in those candidates with hepatic encephalopathy.

TI  - Validation of PROMIS CATs and PROMIS Global Health in an Interdisciplinary Pain 
      Program for Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain.
PG  - E227-E235
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000003232 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To (1) confirm validity of 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical 
      function and pain interference computer-adaptive tests (CATs) and (2) assess the 
      validity of PROMIS Global Health (GH) and five additional PROMIS CATs: social 
      role satisfaction, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance in a 
      population of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) who completed a 3-month 
      Interdisciplinary Pain Program (IPP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent 
      recommendations for assessing outcomes in patients with cLBP have included PROMIS 
      scales; however, there is a need for further evaluation, and PROMIS GH has not 
      been studied in this population. METHODS: The study cohort included patients with 
      cLBP who completed the entirety of a 3-month IPP between August 2016 and December 
      2018. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were analyzed before the start of 
      the IPP and at graduation. Convergent and discriminant validity were evaluated 
      using Pearson correlation coefficients. Known groups' validity assessed the 
      change in PROMIS scores stratified by improvement on the Modified LBP Disability 
      Questionnaire. Responsiveness was evaluated with standardized response means 
      based on global impression of change. RESULTS: IPP was completed by 217 patients 
      (67.7% women, age 53.8 +/- 12.8). Convergent validity was supported (P < 0.01 for 
      all pairwise PROMs comparisons). All PROMs improved significantly by graduation, 
      with the largest improvement for PROMIS pain interference, physical function, 
      social role satisfaction, and Modified LBP Disability Questionnaire. Known 
      groups' validity demonstrated the greatest change on PROMIS physical function, 
      social role satisfaction, pain interference, and depression. Responsiveness was 
      supported for all PROMs in 170 (78.3%) patients who indicated at least minimal 
      improvement (standardized response means 0.43-1.06). CONCLUSION: Our study 
      provides support of PROMIS CATs, highlights the importance of including other 
      meaningful outcome measures, such as social role satisfaction, and provides the 
      first validation of PROMIS GH, in patients with cLBP. PROMs collection can be 
      streamlined through the use of PROMIS CATs which offer advantages over legacy 
      measures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

AB  - PURPOSE: To test the null hypothesis that baseline opioid use is not associated 
      with functional or psychological impairment among new hand surgery clinic 
      patients, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) instruments. METHODS: New adult (>/= 18 years) patient visits to a 
      tertiary academic orthopedic nonshoulder hand and upper extremity clinic between 
      February 2014 and April 2018 were eligible. Collected outcomes include the 
      question, "Are you currently taking narcotic pain medications?", the PROMIS Upper 
      Extremity (UE) computerized adaptive testing (CAT), abbreviated version of the 
      Disorders of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH), PROMIS Physical Function 
      (PF) CAT, PROMIS Pain Interference (PI) CAT, PROMIS Depression CAT, and PROMIS 
      Anxiety CAT. Patients responding to the opioid question, plus the UE CAT or 
      QuickDASH, were included. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression 
      modelling were used to assess factors associated with baseline scores. RESULTS: 
      Of 5997 included patients, 1,046 (17.4%) reported baseline opioid use. Patients 
      in the opioid group demonstrated significantly worse scores on all 
      patient-reported outcomes, and a significantly greater proportion of patients 
      with PROMIS Depression CAT scores exceeding 60 (associated with a clinical 
      diagnosis of depression; 29.5% vs 15.5%). Lower functional scores were observed 
      in the opioid group after controlling for age, sex, other activity-limiting 
      comorbidities, and either depression (UE CAT -7.0; QuickDASH +18.1; and PF CAT 
      -6.6 points), anxiety (UE CAT -6.3; QuickDASH +16.4; PF CAT -6.3), or PI (UE CAT 
      -3.7; QuickDASH +9.5; and PF CAT -4.2 points). Pain interference was greater 
      among opiate users when controlling for age, sex, other activity-limiting 
      comorbidities, and baseline function or psychological status: PI was 2.5, 5.0, or 
      4.3 points greater when controlling for the PROMIS UE CAT, Depression CAT, or 
      Anxiety CAT. CONCLUSIONS: New patients presenting to a hand surgery clinic who 
      endorse use of opioid medications at baseline report significantly decreased 
      physical function, increased psychological burden, and greater levels of pain 
      interference than nonusers. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: At least half of youths with mental disorders are unrecognized and 
      untreated. Rapid, accurate assessment of child mental disorders could facilitate 
      identification and referral and potentially reduce the occurrence of functional 
      disability that stems from early-onset mental disorders. METHOD: Computerized 
      adaptive tests (CATs) based on multidimensional item response theory were 
      developed for depression, anxiety, mania/hypomania, 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant 
      disorder, and suicidality, based on parent and child ratings of 1,060 items each. 
      In phase 1, CATs were developed from 801 participants. In phase 2, predictive, 
      discriminant, and convergent validity were tested against semi-structured 
      research interviews for diagnoses and suicidality in 497 patients and 104 healthy 
      controls. Overall strength of association was determined by area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The child and parent 
      independently completed the Kiddie-Computerized Adaptive Tests (K-CATs) in a 
      median time of 7.56 and 5.03 minutes, respectively, with an average of 7 items 
      per domain. The K-CATs accurately captured the presence of diagnoses (AUCs from 
      0.83 for generalized anxiety disorder to 0.92 for major depressive disorder) and 
      suicidal ideation (AUC = 0.996). Strong correlations with extant measures were 
      found (r >/= 0.60). Test-retest reliability averaged r = 0.80. CONCLUSION: These 
      K-CATs provide a new approach to child psychopathology screening and measurement. 
      Testing can be completed by child and parent in less than 8 minutes and yields 
      results that are highly convergent with much more time-consuming structured 
      clinical interviews and dimensional severity assessment and measurement. Testing 
      of the implementation of the K-CAT is now indicated.

AB  - Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) based on the bifactor model 
      is suitable for tests with multidimensional bifactor measurement structures. 
      Several item selection methods that proved to be more advantageous than the 
      maximum Fisher information method are not practical for bifactor MCAT due to 
      time-consuming computations resulting from high dimensionality. To make them 
      applicable in bifactor MCAT, dimension reduction is applied to four item 
      selection methods, which are the posterior-weighted Fisher D-optimality (PDO) and 
      three non-Fisher information-based methods-posterior expected Kullback-Leibler 
      information (PKL), continuous entropy (CE), and mutual information (MI). They 
      were compared with the Bayesian D-optimality (BDO) method in terms of estimation 
      precision. When both the general and group factors are the measurement 
      objectives, BDO, PDO, CE, and MI perform equally well and better than PKL. When 
      the group factors represent nuisance dimensions, MI and CE perform the best in 
      estimating the general factor, followed by the BDO, PDO, and PKL. How the 
      bifactor pattern and test length affect estimation accuracy was also discussed.

TI  - Implementing electronic health record-integrated screening of patient-reported 
      symptoms and supportive care needs in a comprehensive cancer center.
PG  - 4059-4068
LID - 10.1002/cncr.32172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncology practice can be enhanced by the integration of the 
      assessment of patient-reported symptoms and concerns into the electronic health 
      record (EHR) and clinical workflows. METHODS: Adult oncology outpatients 
      (n = 6825) received 38,422 invitations to complete assessments through the EHR 
      patient portal. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer 
      adaptive tests were administered to assess fatigue, pain interference, physical 
      function, depression, and anxiety. Checklists identified psychosocial, 
      nutritional, and informational needs. In real time, assessment results were 
      populated in the EHR, and clinicians were notified of elevated symptoms and 
      needs. RESULTS: In all, 3521 patients (51.6%) completed 8162 assessments; 
      approximately 55% of the responding patients completed 2 or more within 
      32 months. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression scores were comparable to those 
      of the general population (approximately 5% of assessments triggered clinical 
      alerts across those domains); mean scores indicated a lower level of physical 
      function (with severe scores prompting alerts in nearly 5% of assessments). More 
      than half of assessments triggered an alert based on patient endorsement of 
      supportive care needs, with the majority of those being nutritional (41.82% of 
      assessments). Patient endorsement of supportive care needs was associated with 
      significantly higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain interference scores 
      and lower physical function scores. Patients who triggered clinical alerts tended 
      to be younger and more recently diagnosed, to have greater comorbidities, and to 
      be a racial/ethnic minority. Patients who triggered clinical alerts had more 
      health care service encounters in the ensuing month. CONCLUSIONS: EHR integration 
      facilitated the assessment and reporting of patient-reported symptoms and needs 
      within routine oncology outpatient care.

      With Computerized Adaptive Testing.
PG  - 1040-1043
LID - 10.1176/appi.ps.201900038 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to develop and validate a suite of dimensional 
      measures of psychiatric syndromes for use in a criminal justice population. 
      METHODS: The previously validated Computerized Adaptive Test-Mental Health 
      (CAT-MH) was administered to a sample of 475 defendants in the Cook County Bond 
      Court. Item-level data were used to determine which test items exhibited 
      differential item functioning in this population compared with the population 
      used for the original calibration. RESULTS: After removal of nine items that 
      exhibited differential item functioning from the CAT-MH, correlations between 
      scores based on the original calibration from a nonjustice-involved population 
      and the newly computed scores based on a sample of bond court defendants showed a 
      correlation coefficient of r=0.96 to r=0.99. CONCLUSIONS: With a slight 
      modification of the original CAT-MH, the tool was successfully used to measure 
      severity of depression, anxiety, mania and/or hypomania, suicidality, and 
      substance use disorder in an English- and Spanish-speaking criminal justice 
      population.

AB  - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are a measure of health care quality that 
      reflect the patient's perceptions of their own health status. Recently, there has 
      been a renewed interest in implementation of PROs into everyday clinical 
      practice. There are many dozens of PROs available to foot and ankle surgeons with 
      little consensus on which measures are most appropriate for a given condition. 
      These measures vary widely in length, validity, and content. When integrating 
      PROs into clinical practice, we recommend that clinicians should collect, at a 
      minimum, validated PRO scores that assess pain, function, and general health. 
      Furthermore, concise instruments should be used wherever possible to minimize 
      patient burden, maximize patient engagement, and ensure meaningful data are 
      collected. In the near future, outcomes registries employing computer adaptive 
      testing will facilitate the routine collection of PRO data from all patients.

TI  - Computerized Quality of Life Assessment: A Randomized Experiment to Determine the 
      Impact of Individualized Feedback on Assessment Experience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) assessments, or patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs), are becoming increasingly important in health care and have 
      been associated with improved decision making, higher satisfaction, and better 
      outcomes of care. Some physicians and patients may find questionnaires too 
      burdensome; however, this issue could be addressed by making use of computerized 
      adaptive testing (CAT). In addition, making the questionnaire more interesting, 
      for example by providing graphical and contextualized feedback, may further 
      improve the experience of the users. However, little is known about how shorter 
      assessments and feedback impact user experience. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a 
      controlled experiment to assess the impact of tailored multimodal feedback and 
      CAT on user experience in QoL assessment using validated PROMs. METHODS: We 
      recruited a representative sample from the general population in the United 
      Kingdom using the Oxford Prolific academic Web panel. Participants completed 
      either a CAT version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment 
      (WHOQOL-CAT) or the fixed-length WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreviated version of the 
      WHOQOL-100. We randomly assigned participants to conditions in which they would 
      receive no feedback, graphical feedback only, or graphical and adaptive 
      text-based feedback. Participants rated the assessment in terms of perceived 
      acceptability, engagement, clarity, and accuracy. RESULTS: We included 1386 
      participants in our analysis. Assessment experience was improved when graphical 
      and tailored text-based feedback was provided along with PROMs (Delta=0.22, P<.001). 
      Providing graphical feedback alone was weakly associated with improvement in 
      overall experience (Delta=0.10, P=.006). Graphical and text-based feedback made the 
      questionnaire more interesting, and users were more likely to report they would 
      share the results with a physician or family member (Delta=0.17, P<.001, and Delta=0.17, 
      P<.001, respectively). No difference was found in perceived accuracy of the 
      graphical feedback scores of the WHOQOL-CAT and WHOQOL-BREF (Delta=0.06, P=.05). CAT 
      (stopping rule [SE<0.45]) resulted in the administration of 25% fewer items than 
      the fixed-length assessment, but it did not result in an improved user experience 
      (P=.21). CONCLUSIONS: Using tailored text-based feedback to contextualize numeric 
      scores maximized the acceptability of electronic QoL assessment. Improving user 
      experience may increase response rates and reduce attrition in research and 
      clinical use of PROMs. In this study, CAT administration was associated with a 
      modest decrease in assessment length but did not improve user experience. 
      Patient-perceived accuracy of feedback was equivalent when comparing CAT with 
      fixed-length assessment. Fixed-length forms are already generally acceptable to 
      respondents; however, CAT might have an advantage over longer questionnaires that 
      would be considered burdensome. Further research is warranted to explore the 
      relationship between assessment length, feedback, and response burden in diverse 
      populations.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent literature on the adaptive assessment of 
      complex mental health disorders and provide a detailed comparison of classical 
      test theory and adaptive testing based on multidimensional item response theory. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Adaptive tests for a wide variety of mental health traits (e.g., 
      depression, anxiety, mania, substance misuse, suicidality) are now available in a 
      cloud-based environment. These tests have been validated in a variety of settings 
      against lengthy structured clinical interviews with excellent results and even 
      higher reliability than fixed-length tests. Applications include screening and 
      assessments in emergency departments, psychiatric and primary care clinics, 
      student health clinics, perinatal medicine clinics, child welfare settings, and 
      the judicial system. The future of mental health measurement will be based on 
      automated screening and assessments. Adaptive tests will provide increased 
      precision of measurement and decreased burden of measurement. Integration into 
      the electronic health record is important and now easily accomplished.

PG  - 675
LID - 10.1186/s12889-019-7038-0 [doi]
LID - 675
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal data suggest that jet fuels such as JP-8 are associated with 
      hearing deficits when combined with noise and that the effect is more pronounced 
      than with noise exposure alone. Some studies suggest peripheral dysfunction while 
      others suggest central auditory dysfunction. Human data are limited in this 
      regard. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible chronic adverse 
      effects of JP-8 combined with noise exposure on the peripheral and central 
      auditory systems in humans. METHODS: Fifty-seven participants who were current 
      personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were selected. Based on their 
      levels of exposure to jet fuels, participants were divided into three exposure 
      groups (low, moderate, high). Groups were also categorised based on their noise 
      exposure levels (low, moderate, high). All participants were evaluated by 
      tympanometry, pure-tone audiometry (1-12 kHz), distortion product otoacoustic 
      emissions (DPOAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), words-in-noise, compressed 
      speech, dichotic digit test, pitch pattern sequence test, duration pattern 
      sequence test and adaptive test of temporal resolution. All auditory tests were 
      carried out after the participants were away from the Air Force base for a 
      minimum of two weeks, thus two weeks without jet fuel and noise exposure. 
      RESULTS: Jet fuel exposure was significantly associated with hearing thresholds 
      at 4 and 8 kHz; average hearing thresholds across frequencies in the better ear; 
      DPOAEs at 2.8, 4 and 6 kHz; ABR wave V latency in the right ear; compressed 
      speech and words-in-noise. Further analyses revealed that participants with low 
      exposure level to jet fuels showed significantly better results for the 
      aforementioned procedures than participants with moderate and high exposure 
      levels. All results were controlled for the covariates of age and noise exposure 
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that jet fuel exposure, when combined 
      with noise exposure, has an adverse effect on audibility in humans. Taking all 
      the test results into consideration, jet fuel exposure combined with noise 
      exposure specifically seems to affect the peripheral hearing system in humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasingly rapid growth of the elderly population, 
      individuals aged 65 years and above now compose 14% of Taiwanese citizens, 
      thereby making Taiwanese society an aged society. A leading factor that affects 
      the elderly population is dementia. A method of precisely and efficiently 
      examining patients with dementia through multidimensional computer adaptive 
      testing (MCAT) to accurately determine the patients' stage of dementia needs to 
      be developed. This study aimed to develop online MCAT that family members can use 
      on their own computers, tablets, or smartphones to predict the extent of dementia 
      for patients responding to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) instrument. 
      METHODS: The CDR was applied to 366 outpatients in a hospital in Taiwan. MCAT was 
      employed with parameters for items across eight dimensions, and responses were 
      simulated to compare the efficiency and precision between MCAT and non-adaptive 
      testing (NAT). The number of items saved and the estimated person measures was 
      compared between the results of MCAT and NAT, respectively. RESULTS: MCAT yielded 
      substantially more precise measurements and was considerably more efficient than 
      NAT. MCAT achieved 20.19% (= [53 - 42.3]/53) saving in item length when the 
      measurement differences were less than 5%. Pearson correlation coefficients were 
      highly consistent among the eight domains. The cut-off points for the overall 
      measures were - 1.4, - 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 logits, which was equivalent to 20% for 
      each portion in percentile scores. Substantially fewer items were answered 
      through MCAT than through NAT without compromising the precision of MCAT. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Developing a website that family members can use on their own 
      computers, tablets, and smartphones to help them perform online screening and 
      prediction of dementia in older adults is useful and manageable.

TI  - What is the Impact of Social Deprivation on Physical and Mental Health in 
      Orthopaedic Patients?
PG  - 1825-1835
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000000698 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex interrelationship among physical health, mental health, 
      and social health has gained the attention of the medical community in recent 
      years. Poor social health, also called social deprivation, has been linked to 
      more disease and a more-negative impact from disease across a wide variety of 
      health conditions. However, it remains unknown how social deprivation is related 
      to physical and mental health in patients presenting for orthopaedic care. 
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do patients living in zip codes with higher social 
      deprivation report lower levels of physical function and higher levels of pain 
      interference, depression, and anxiety as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) at initial presentation to an orthopaedic 
      provider than those from less deprived areas; and if so, is this relationship 
      independent of other potentially confounding factors such as age, sex, and race? 
      (2) Does the relationship between the level of social deprivation of a patient's 
      community and that patient's physical function, pain interference, depression, 
      and anxiety, as measured by PROMIS remain consistent across all orthopaedic 
      subspecialties? (3) Are there differences in the proportion of individuals from 
      areas of high and low levels of social deprivation seen by the various 
      orthopaedic subspecialties at one large, tertiary orthopaedic referral center? 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional evaluation analyzed 7500 new adult patients 
      presenting to an orthopaedic center between August 1, 2016 and December 15, 2016. 
      Patients completed PROMIS Physical Function-v1.2, Pain Interference-v1.1, 
      Depression-v1.0, and Anxiety-v1.0 Computer Adaptive Tests. The Area Deprivation 
      Index, a composite measure of community-level social deprivation, based on 
      multiple census metrics such as income, education level, and housing type for a 
      given nine-digit zip code was used to estimate individual social deprivation. 
      Statistical analysis determined the effect of disparate area deprivation (based 
      on most- and least-deprived national quartiles) for the entire sample as well as 
      for patients categorized by the orthopaedic subspecialty providing care. 
      Comparisons of PROMIS scores among these groups were based on an MCID of 5 points 
      for each PROMIS domain (Effect size 0.5). RESULTS: Patients living in zip codes 
      with the highest levels of social deprivation had worse mean scores across all 
      four PROMIS domains when compared with those living in the least-deprived 
      quartile (physical function 38 +/- 9 versus 43 +/- 9, mean difference 4, 95% CI, 
      3.7-5.0; p < 0.001; pain interference 64 +/- 8 versus 60+/-8, mean difference -4, 
      95% CI, -4.8 to -3.7; p < 0.001; depression 50+/-11 versus 45+/-8, mean 
      difference -5, 95% CI, -6.0 to -4.5; p < 0.001; anxiety 56+/-11 versus 50 +/-10, 
      mean difference -6, 95% CI, -6.9 to -5.4; p < 0.001). There were no differences 
      in physical function, pain interference, depression, or anxiety PROMIS scores 
      between patients from the most- and least-deprived quartiles who presented to the 
      subspecialties of spine (physical function, mean 35+/-7 versus 35+/-7; p = 0.872; 
      pain interference, 67+/-7 versus 66+/-7; p = 0.562; depression, 54+/-12 versus 51 
      +/-10; p = 0.085; and anxiety, 60+/-11 versus 58 +/-9; p = 0.163), oncology 
      (physical function, mean 33+/-9 versus 38 +/-13; p = 0.105; pain interference, 
      68+/-9 versus 64+/-10; p = 0.144; depression, 51+/-10 versus 52+/-13; p = 0.832; 
      anxiety, 59+/-11 versus 59+/-10 p = 0.947); and trauma (physical function, 
      35+/-11 versus 32+/-10; p = 0.268; pain interference, 66+/-7 versus 67+/-6; p = 
      0.566; depression, 52+/-12 versus 53+/-11; p = 0.637; and anxiety, 59+/-12 versus 
      60+/-9 versus; p = 0.800). The social deprivation-based differences in all PROMIS 
      domains remained for the subspecialties of foot/ankle, where mean differences 
      ranged from 3 to 6 points on the PROMIS domains (p < 0.001 for all four domains), 
      joint reconstruction where mean differences ranged from 4 to 7 points on the 
      PROMIS domains (p < 0.001 for all four domains), sports medicine where mean 
      differences in PROMIS scores ranged from 3 to 5 between quartiles (p < 0.001 for 
      all four domains), and finally upper extremity where mean differences in PROMIS 
      scores between the most- and least-deprived quartiles were five points for each 
      PROMIS domain (p < 0.001 for all four domains). The proportion of individuals 
      from the most- and least-deprived quartiles was distinct when looking across all 
      seven subspecialty categories; only 11% of patients presenting to sports medicine 
      providers and 17% of patients presenting to upper extremity providers were from 
      the most-deprived quartile, while 39% of trauma patients were from the 
      most-deprived quartile (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic patients must be 
      considered within the context of their social environment because it influences 
      patient-reported physical and mental health as well as has potential implications 
      for treatment and prognosis. Social deprivation may need to be considered when 
      using patient-reported outcomes to judge the value of care delivered between 
      practices or across specialties. Further studies should examine potential 
      interventions to improve the perceived health of patients residing in communities 
      with greater social deprivation and to determine how social health influences 
      ultimate orthopaedic treatment outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic 
      study.

TI  - What Role Does Positive Psychology Play in Understanding Pain Intensity and 
      Disability Among Patients with Hand and Upper Extremity Conditions?
PG  - 1769-1776
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000000694 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large body of research shows that psychologic distress and 
      ineffective coping strategies substantially contribute to more severe pain and 
      increased physical limitations among patients with orthopaedic disorders. 
      However, little is known about the relationship between positive psychology 
      (constructs that enable individuals to thrive and adapt to challenges) and pain 
      and physical limitations in this population. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which 
      positive-psychology factors (satisfaction with life, gratitude, coping through 
      humor, resilience, mindfulness, and optimism) are independently associated with 
      fewer upper-extremity physical limitations after controlling for the other 
      clinical and demographic variables? (2) Which positive-psychology factors are 
      independently associated with pain intensity after controlling for relevant 
      clinical and demographic variables? METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we 
      recruited patients presenting for a scheduled appointment with an orthopaedic 
      surgeon at a hand and upper-extremity clinic of a major urban academic medical 
      center. Of 125 approached patients, 119 (44% men; mean age, 50 +/- 17 years) met 
      screening criteria and agreed to participate. Patients completed a clinical and 
      demographic questionnaire, the Numerical Rating Scale to assess pain intensity, 
      the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper 
      Extremity Physical Function computerized adaptive test to assess physical 
      limitations, and six measures assessing positive-psychology constructs: The 
      Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Gratitude Questionnaire, the Coping Humor 
      Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness 
      Scale-Revised, and the Life Orientation Test-Revised. We first examined bivariate 
      associations among physical limitations, pain intensity, and all 
      positive-psychology factors as well as demographic and clinical variables. All 
      variables that demonstrated associations with physical limitations or pain 
      intensity at p < 0.05 were included in two-stage multivariable hierarchical 
      regression models. RESULTS: After controlling for the potentially confounding 
      effects of prior surgical treatment and duration since pain onset (step1; R total 
      = 0.306; F[7,103] = 6.50), the positive-psychology variables together explained 
      an additional 15% (R change = 0.145, F change [5, 103] = 4.297, p = 0.001) of the 
      variance in physical limitations. Among the positive-psychology variables tested, 
      mindfulness was the only one associated with fewer physical limitations (beta = 
      0.228, t = 2.293, p = 0.024, 4% variance explained). No confounding demographic 
      or clinical variables were found for pain intensity in bivariate analyses. All 
      positive-psychology variables together explained 23% of the variance in pain 
      intensity (R = 0.23; F[5,106] = 6.38, p < 0.001). Among the positive-psychology 
      variables, satisfaction with life was the sole factor independently associated 
      with higher intensity (beta = -0.237, t = -2.16, p = 0.033, 3% variance explained). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Positive-psychology variables explained 15% of the variance in 
      physical limitations and for 23% of the variance in pain intensity among patients 
      with heterogenous upper extremity disorders within a hand and upper extremity 
      practice. Of all positive-psychology factors, mindfulness and satisfaction with 
      life were most important for physical limitations and pain intensity, 
      respectively. As positive-psychology factors are more easily modifiable through 
      skills-based interventions than pain and physical limitations, results suggest 
      implementation of such interventions to potentially improve outcomes in this 
      population. Skills-based interventions targeting mindfulness and satisfaction 
      with life may be of particular benefit. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic 
      study.

      prostate cancer.
PG  - 403-409
LID - 10.1037/hea0000672 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study outlined the implementation and feasibility of delivering 
      PROMIS(R) computer adaptive tests (CATs) using a web-based method to evaluate the 
      impact of a technological adaptation of Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management 
      (CBSM) on the psychosocial functioning of men with advanced prostate cancer (APC) 
      undergoing hormone therapy. METHOD: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group 
      intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control 
      condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using 
      tablets, and completed PROMIS(R) computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, 
      depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 
      10-week intervention. RESULTS: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and 
      week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS(R) 
      CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant 
      group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS(R) 
      domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple 
      effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS(R) anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for 
      both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical 
      variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS(R) CATs to repeatedly 
      assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that 
      web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and 
      adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy. (PsycINFO

TI  - Pleiotropy informed adaptive association test of multiple traits using 
      genome-wide association study summary data.
PG  - 1076-1085
LID - 10.1111/biom.13076 [doi]
AB  - Genetic variants associated with disease outcomes can be used to develop 
      personalized treatment. To reach this precision medicine goal, hundreds of 
      large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in the 
      past decade to search for promising genetic variants associated with various 
      traits. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related 
      variants. However, in total these identified variants explain only part of the 
      variation for most complex traits. There remain many genetic variants with small 
      effect sizes to be discovered, which calls for the development of (a) GWAS with 
      more samples and more comprehensively genotyped variants, for example, the NHLBI 
      Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is planning to conduct whole 
      genome sequencing on over 100 000 individuals; and (b) novel and more powerful 
      statistical analysis methods. The current dominating GWAS analysis approach is 
      the "single trait" association test, despite the fact that many GWAS are 
      conducted in deeply phenotyped cohorts including many correlated and 
      well-characterized outcomes, which can help improve the power to detect novel 
      variants if properly analyzed, as suggested by increasing evidence that 
      pleiotropy, where a genetic variant affects multiple traits, is the norm in 
      genome-phenome associations. We aim to develop pleiotropy informed powerful 
      association test methods across multiple traits for GWAS. Since it is generally 
      very hard to access individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data for those 
      existing GWAS, due to privacy concerns and various logistical considerations, we 
      develop rigorous statistical methods for pleiotropy informed adaptive multitrait 
      association test methods that need only summary association statistics publicly 
      available from most GWAS. We first develop a pleiotropy test, which has powerful 
      performance for truly pleiotropic variants but is sensitive to the pleiotropy 
      assumption. We then develop a pleiotropy informed adaptive test that has robust 
      and powerful performance under various genetic models. We develop accurate and 
      efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-value for the proposed 
      adaptive test without the need of resampling or permutation. We illustrate the 
      performance of proposed methods through application to joint association test of 
      GWAS meta-analysis summary data for several glycemic traits. Our proposed 
      adaptive test identified several novel loci missed by individual trait based GWAS 
      meta-analysis. All the proposed methods are implemented in a publicly available R 
      package.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in 
      orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test. DESIGN: This is a 
      psychometric study. SETTING: The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in 
      two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany. SUBJECTS: A total of 474 
      orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Not applicable. MAIN MEASURES: The main measure is an adapted version of an 
      existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients. RESULTS: 
      The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a 
      one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) 
      could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch 
      model with a non-significant item-trait interaction (chi(2)(203) = 172.59; P = .94) 
      and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be 
      verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold 
      parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits). CONCLUSION: The 
      unidimensional anxiety item bank provides the basis for a computer-adaptive test 
      to assess a wide range of anxiety in rehabilitation patients with orthopedic 
      diseases with very good psychometric characteristics.

AB  - Genome-wide sequencing enables evaluation of associations between traits and 
      combinations of variants in genes and pathways. But such evaluation requires 
      multi-locus association tests with good power, regardless of the variant and 
      trait characteristics. And since analyzing families may yield more power than 
      analyzing unrelated individuals, we need multi-locus tests applicable to both 
      related and unrelated individuals. Here we describe such tests, and we introduce 
      SKAT-X, a new test statistic that uses genome-wide data obtained from related or 
      unrelated subjects to optimize power for the specific data at hand. Simulations 
      show that: a) SKAT-X performs well regardless of variant and trait 
      characteristics; and b) for binary traits, analyzing affected relatives brings 
      more power than analyzing unrelated individuals, consistent with previous 
      findings for single-locus tests. We illustrate the methods by application to rare 
      unclassified missense variants in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA2, as applied to 
      combined data from prostate cancer families and unrelated prostate cancer cases 
      and controls in the Multi-ethnic Cohort (MEC). The methods can be implemented 
      using open-source code for public use as the R-package GATARS (Genetic 
      Association Tests for Arbitrarily Related Subjects)

TI  - The mistuning perception test: A new measurement instrument.
PG  - 663-675
LID - 10.3758/s13428-019-01225-1 [doi]
AB  - An important aspect of the perceived quality of vocal music is the degree to 
      which the vocalist sings in tune. Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal 
      mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or 
      how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting 
      measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of 
      mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts 
      (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; 
      Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the 
      instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a 
      two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a 
      pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item 
      response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A 
      subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants 
      with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test's 
      reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be 
      deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our 
      understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.

TI  - Utilizing the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) 
      to increase referral to ancillary support services for severely symptomatic 
      patients with gynecologic cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) 
      Network has developed a comprehensive repository of electronic patient reported 
      outcomes measures (ePROs) of major symptom domains that have been validated in 
      cancer patients. Their use for patients with gynecologic cancer has been 
      understudied. Our objective was to establish feasibility and acceptability of 
      PROMIS ePRO integration in a gynecologic oncology outpatient clinic and assess if 
      it can help identify severely symptomatic patients and increase referral to 
      supportive services. METHODS: English-speaking patients with a confirmed history 
      of gynecologic cancer completed PROMIS ePROs on iPads in the waiting area of an 
      outpatient gynecologic oncology clinic. Symptom scores were calculated for each 
      respondent and grouped using documented severity thresholds. Response data was 
      compared with clinicopathologic characteristics across symptom domains. Severely 
      symptomatic patients were offered referral to ancillary services and asked to 
      complete post-exposure surveys assessing acceptability of the ePRO. RESULTS: Of 
      the 336 patients who completed ePROs, 35% had active disease and 19% had 
      experienced at least one disease recurrence. Sixty-nine percent of the cohort 
      demonstrated moderate to severe physical dysfunction (60%), pain (36%), fatigue 
      (28%), anxiety (9%), depression (8%), and sexual dysfunction (32%). Thirty-nine 
      (12%) severely symptomatic patients were referred to services such as psychiatry, 
      palliative care, pain management, social work or integrative oncology care. Most 
      survey respondents identified the ePROs as helpful (78%) and easy to complete 
      (92%). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient PROMIS ePRO administration is feasible and 
      acceptable to gynecologic oncology patients and can help identify severely 
      symptomatic patients for referral to ancillary support services.

PG  - 518-532
LID - 10.1177/1073191119832657 [doi]
AB  - The current study developed and examined the performance of a computerized 
      adaptive version of the Social Interaction Anxiety and Social Phobia Scales 
      (SIAS/SPS) and compared results with a previously developed static short form 
      (SIAS-6/SPS-6) in terms of measurement precision, concordance with the full 
      forms, and sensitivity to treatment. Among an online sample of Australian adults, 
      there were relatively minor differences in the performance of the adaptive tests 
      and static short forms when compared with the full scales. Moreover, both 
      adaptive and static short forms generated similar effect sizes across treatment 
      in a clinical sample. This provides further evidence for the use of static or 
      adaptive short forms of the SIAS/SPS rather than the lengthier 20-item versions. 
      However, at the individual level, the adaptive tests were able to maintain an 
      acceptable level of precision, using few items as possible, across the severity 
      continua in contrast to the static short forms.

TI  - What Information Works Best?: A Comparison of Routing Methods.
PG  - 499-515
LID - 10.1177/0146621617752990 [doi]
AB  - There are many item selection methods proposed for computerized adaptive testing 
      (CAT) applications. However, not all of them have been used in computerized 
      multistage testing (ca-MST). This study uses some item selection methods as a 
      routing method in ca-MST framework. These are maximum Fisher information (MFI), 
      maximum likelihood weighted information (MLWI), maximum posterior weighted 
      information (MPWI), Kullback-Leibler (KL), and posterior Kullback-Leibler (KLP). 
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the performance of these methods 
      when they are used as a routing method in ca-MST applications. These five 
      information methods under four ca-MST panel designs and two test lengths (30 
      items and 60 items) were tested using the parameters of a real item bank. Results 
      were evaluated with overall findings (mean bias, root mean square error, 
      correlation between true and estimated thetas, and module exposure rates) and 
      conditional findings (conditional absolute bias, standard error of measurement, 
      and root mean square error). It was found that test length affected the outcomes 
      much more than other study conditions. Under 30-item conditions, 1-3 designs 
      outperformed other panel designs. Under 60-item conditions, 1-3-3 designs were 
      better than other panel designs. Each routing method performed well under 
      particular conditions; there was no clear best method in the studied conditions. 
      The recommendations for routing methods in any particular condition were provided 
      for researchers and practitioners as well as the limitations of these results.

AB  - This study explored calibrating a large item bank for use in multidimensional 
      health measurement with computerized adaptive testing, using both item responses 
      and response time (RT) information. The Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care is a 
      patient-reported outcomes measure comprised of three correlated scales (Applied 
      Cognition, Daily Activities, and Mobility). All items from each scale are Likert 
      type, so that a respondent chooses a response from an ordered set of four 
      response options. The most appropriate item response theory model for analyzing 
      and scoring these items is the multidimensional graded response model (MGRM). 
      During the field testing of the items, an interviewer read each item to a patient 
      and recorded, on a tablet computer, the patient's responses and the software 
      recorded RTs. Due to the large item bank with over 300 items, data collection was 
      conducted in four batches with a common set of anchor items to link the scale. 
      van der Linden's (2007) hierarchical modeling framework was adopted. Several 
      models, with or without interviewer as a covariate and with or without 
      interaction between interviewer and items, were compared for each batch of data. 
      It was found that the model with the interaction between interviewer and item, 
      when the interaction effect was constrained to be proportional, fit the data 
      best. Therefore, the final hierarchical model with a lognormal model for RT and 
      the MGRM for response data was fitted to all batches of data via a concurrent 
      calibration. Evaluation of parameter estimates revealed that (1) adding response 
      time information did not affect the item parameter estimates and their standard 
      errors significantly; (2) adding response time information helped reduce the 
      standard error of patients' multidimensional latent trait estimates, but adding 
      interviewer as a covariate did not result in further improvement. Implications of 
      the findings for follow up adaptive test delivery design are discussed.

TI  - Relationship Between PROMIS Computer Adaptive Tests and Legacy Hip Measures Among 
      Patients Presenting to a Tertiary Care Hip Preservation Center.
PG  - 876-884
LID - 10.1177/0363546518825252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Legacy hip outcome measures may be burdensome to patients and 
      sometimes yield floor or ceiling effects. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) allow for low-burden 
      data capture and limited ceiling and floor effects. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The 
      purpose of this study was to determine whether the PROMIS CAT domains demonstrate 
      correlation against commonly used legacy patient-reported outcome measures in a 
      population of patients presenting to a tertiary care hip preservation center. The 
      authors hypothesized the following: (1) PROMIS CAT scores based on physical 
      function (PF), pain interference (PIF), pain behavior, and pain intensity would 
      show strong correlation with the following legacy scores: modified Harris Hip 
      Score (mHHS), International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12), Hip Outcome Score 
      (HOS) Sports and Activities of Daily Living subscales, and Veterans RAND-6D 
      (VR-6D) utility measure. (2) The mental and physical health portions of the VR-6D 
      legacy measure would show weak correlation with mental- and psychosocial-specific 
      PROMIS elements-depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and ability to participate 
      in social roles and activities. (3) All PROMIS measures would exhibit fewer floor 
      and ceiling effects than legacy scores. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); 
      Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Prospective data were collected on 125 patients in 
      the hip preservation clinics. Enrollees completed legacy scores (visual analog 
      scale for pain, mHHS, iHOT-12, HOS, and VR-6D) and PROMIS CAT questionnaires (PF, 
      PIF, pain behavior, anxiety, depression, sleep, social roles and activities, pain 
      intensity, fatigue). Spearman rank correlations were calculated, with r(s) values 
      of 0 to 0.3 indicating negligible correlation; 0.3 to 0.5, weak correlation; 0.5 
      to 0.7, moderately strong correlation; and >0.7, strong correlation. Floor and 
      ceiling effects were evaluated. RESULTS: As anticipated, the PF-CAT yielded 
      strong correlations with the iHOT-12, mHHS, HOS-Sports, HOS-Activities of Daily 
      Living, and VR-6D, with r(s) values of 0.76, 0.71, 0.81, 0.87, and 0.71, 
      respectively. The PIF-CAT was the only pain score to show moderately strong to 
      strong correlation with all 14 patient-reported outcome measures. A strong 
      correlation was observed between the VR-6D and the social roles and activities 
      CAT ( r(s) = 0.73). The depression CAT had a significant floor effect at 19%. No 
      additional floor or ceiling effect was present for any other legacy or PROMIS 
      measure. CONCLUSION: The PF-CAT shows strong correlation with legacy 
      patient-reported outcome scores among patients presenting to a tertiary care hip 
      preservation center. The PIF-CAT also correlates strongly with legacy and PROMIS 
      measures evaluating physical and mental well-being. PROMIS measures are less 
      burdensome and demonstrate no floor or ceiling effects, making them a potential 
      alternative to legacy patient-reported outcome measures for the hip.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computer-adaptive tests (CAT) use individualised sets of questions to 
      assess patient-reported health states, whereas static (conventional) 
      questionnaires present the same questions to all patients. CAT has been shown to 
      increase measurement precision and reduce assessment length. In our study, we 
      investigated if patients perceive CAT questions as more appropriate than static 
      questionnaires, a claim that is frequently associated with CAT measures. METHODS: 
      We compared the static European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
      Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) against its corresponding 
      CAT measures focusing on two domains: Physical Functioning (PF) and Emotional 
      Functioning (EF). Cancer patients completed the questionnaires and participated 
      in a cognitive interview to assess how appropriate they perceive the QLQ-C30 and 
      the CAT questions for their current health state. RESULTS: Forty-four cancer 
      patients (mean age = 54.6; 56.8% female) were assessed. For the PF domain, 
      patients considered the CAT items more appropriate (p = 0.002) than the QLQ-C30 
      items (56.8% vs. 15.9%; 27.2% indifferent). For the EF domain, patients were in 
      favour of the QLQ-C30 items (p < 0.001), with 54.5% considering the QLQ-C30, and 
      4.5% considering the CAT items to be more appropriate; 40.9% were indifferent. 
      Most patients (N = 36) commented on the preference for the CAT (PF), mentioning 
      better matching of the questions and the health state (38.6%) and better item 
      wording (15.9%). CONCLUSION: For the PF domain the CAT measure better matched the 
      score distribution in the patient sample than the QLQ-C30 PF scale and was 
      consequently considered more appropriate by patients. For the EF domain, the CAT 
      measure did not show better fit than the QLQ-C30 and hence no such preference in 
      terms of appropriateness was observed.

TI  - Validation of the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health in Primary Care.
PG  - 23-30
LID - 10.1370/afm.2316 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for 
      depression in the general adult population. Although screening questionnaires for 
      depression and anxiety exist in primary care settings, electronic health tools 
      such as computerized adaptive tests based on item response theory can advance 
      screening practices. This study evaluated the validity of the Computerized 
      Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) for screening for major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) and assessing MDD and anxiety severity among adult primary care 
      patients. METHODS: We approached 402 English-speaking adults for participation 
      from a primary care clinic, of whom 271 adults (71% female, 65% black) 
      participated. Participants completed modules from the CAT-MH (Computerized 
      Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD, CAT-Depression Inventory, CAT-Anxiety 
      Inventory); brief paper questionnaires (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
      [PHQ-9], 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Generalized Anxiety 
      Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]); and a reference-standard interview, the 
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
      Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) Diagnoses. RESULTS: On the basis of the 
      interview, 31 participants met criteria for MDD and 29 met criteria for GAD. The 
      diagnostic accuracy of the Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for MDD (area 
      under curve [AUC] = 0.85) was similar to that of the PHQ-9 (AUC = 0.84) and 
      higher than that of the PHQ-2 (AUC = 0.76) for MDD screening. Using the interview 
      as the reference standard, the accuracy of the CAT-Anxiety Inventory (AUC = 0.93) 
      was similar to that of the GAD-7 (AUC = 0.97) for assessing anxiety severity. The 
      patient-preferred screening method was assessment via tablet/computer with audio. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Computerized adaptive testing could be a valid and efficient 
      patient-centered screening strategy for depression and anxiety screening in 
      primary care settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the authors demonstrate to spine surgeons the 
      prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression among patients presenting for 
      surgery and explore the relationships between different legacy and 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) screening 
      measures. METHODS: A total of 512 adult spine surgery patients at a single 
      institution completed the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire 
      (GAD-7), 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression scale, and PROMIS 
      Anxiety and Depression computer-adaptive tests (CATs) preoperatively. Correlation 
      coefficients were calculated between PROMIS scores and GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores. 
      Published reference tables were used to determine the presence of anxiety or 
      depression using GAD-7 and PHQ-8. Sensitivity and specificity of published 
      guidance on the PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were compared. Guidance from 3 
      sources was compared: published GAD-7 and PHQ-8 crosswalk tables, American 
      Psychiatric Association scales, and expert clinical consensus. Receiver operator 
      characteristic curves were used to determine data-driven cut-points for PROMIS 
      Anxiety and Depression. Significance was accepted as p < 0.05. RESULTS: In 512 
      spine surgery patients, anxiety and depression were prevalent preoperatively (55% 
      with any anxiety, 24% with generalized anxiety screen-positive; and 54% with any 
      depression, 24% with probable major depression). Correlations were moderately 
      strong between PROMIS Anxiety and GAD-7 scores (r = 0.72; p < 0.001) and between 
      PROMIS Depression and PHQ-8 scores (r = 0.74; p < 0.001). The observed 
      correlation of the PROMIS Depression score was greater with the PHQ-8 
      cognitive/affective score (r = 0.766) than with the somatic score (r = 0.601) (p 
      < 0.001). PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were able to detect the presence of 
      generalized anxiety screen-positive (sensitivity, 86.0%; specificity, 81.6%) and 
      of probable major depression (sensitivity, 82.3%; specificity, 81.4%). Receiver 
      operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated data-driven cut-points for 
      these groups. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs are reliable tools 
      for identifying generalized anxiety screen-positive spine surgery patients and 
      those with probable major depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide risk assessments are often challenging for clinicians, and 
      therefore, biological markers are warranted as guiding tools in these 
      assessments. Suicidal patients display increased cytokine levels in peripheral 
      blood, although the composite inflammatory profile in the subjects is still 
      unknown. It is also not yet established whether certain inflammatory changes are 
      specific to suicidal subjects. To address this, we measured 45 immunobiological 
      factors in peripheral blood and identified the biological profiles associated 
      with cross-diagnostic suicide risk and depression, respectively. METHODS: 
      Sixty-six women with mood and anxiety disorders underwent computerized adaptive 
      testing for mental health, assessing depression and suicide risk. Weighted 
      correlation network analysis was used to uncover system level associations 
      between suicide risk, depression, and the immunobiological factors in plasma. 
      Secondary regression models were used to establish the sensitivity of the results 
      to potential confounders, including age, body mass index (BMI), treatment and 
      symptoms of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The biological profile of patients 
      assessed to be at increased suicide risk differed from that associated with 
      depression. At the system level, a biological cluster containing increased levels 
      of interleukin-6, lymphocytes, monocytes, white blood cell count and 
      polymorphonuclear leukocyte count significantly impacted suicide risk, with the 
      latter two inferring the strongest influence. The cytokine interleukin-8 was 
      independently and negatively associated with increased suicide risk. The results 
      remained after adjusting for confounders. LIMITATIONS: This study is 
      cross-sectional and not designed to prove causality. DISCUSSION: A unique 
      immunobiological profile was linked to increased suicide risk. The profile was 
      different from that observed in patients with depressive symptoms, and indicates 
      that granulocyte mediated biological mechanisms could be activated in patients at 
      risk for suicide.

TI  - PROMIS Physical and Emotional Health Scores Are Worse in Musculoskeletal Patients 
      Presenting to Physiatrists than to Other Orthopedic Specialists.
PG  - 604-612
LID - 10.1002/pmrj.12068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiatrists' unique training in person-centered biopsychosocial 
      management of complex problems may influence musculoskeletal patients' 
      expectations and self- and/or physician-referral patterns to physiatrists. 
      Consequently, average patient complexity and need for multi-disciplinary services 
      may be increased in physiatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare musculoskeletal 
      patients' self-reported physical and emotional health according to provider 
      specialty. Researchers tested the null hypothesis that there is no significant 
      difference in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      scores between patients who present to physiatrists in comparison to other 
      musculoskeletal specialists. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Orthopedic 
      department of a tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Participants included 
      31 791 new adult patients (mean age 52.6 +/- 16.2 years) who presented for initial 
      elective evaluation of a musculoskeletal problem by an orthopedic surgeon or 
      sports medicine trained emergency medicine, family medicine, pediatric, or 
      physiatric physician. METHODS: Patients completed the PROMIS computer adaptive 
      test (CAT) Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression domains 
      at department check-in prior to the physician encounter. Score differences by 
      provider type were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASUREMENTS: Mean PROMIS score in each domain subdivided by physiatric, 
      surgical, and other nonsurgical provider type. RESULTS: In total, 2081 patients 
      presented to physiatrists, 28 267 presented to surgeons, and 1443 presented to 
      other nonsurgical providers. For each respective provider type, average PROMIS 
      scores were Physical Function 38.9 +/- 8.2, 41.5 +/- 9.5, and 43.5 +/- 8.2; Pain 
      Interference 62.6 +/- 7.2, 60.9 +/- 7.7, and 59.2 +/- 6.8; Anxiety 54.5 +/- 10.4, 
      51.9 +/- 10.6, and 49.8 +/- 9.8; and Depression 49.3 +/- 10.4, 47.0 +/- 10.0, and 
      44.2 +/- 8.7. Physiatric patients had significantly worse average scores for all 
      domains compared to surgical (P < .001) and other nonsurgical patients 
      (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Average PROMIS Physical Function, Pain Interference, 
      Anxiety, and Depression scores were worse in musculoskeletal patients who 
      presented to physiatrists in comparison to surgical or other nonsurgical 
      providers. This suggests that some patients who choose to see or are referred to 
      see physiatrists may have more or be more willing to endorse having 
      biopsychosocial impairments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

TI  - Development and Psychometric Assessment of Novel Item Banks for Hereditary 
      Retinal Diseases.
PG  - 27-34
LID - 10.1097/OPX.0000000000001317 [doi]
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: This study develops psychometrically valid item banks across 10 
      areas of quality of life (QoL) specific to people with hereditary retinal 
      diseases, which will enable clinicians and researchers to explore the impact of 
      hereditary retinal diseases across all aspects of QoL. PURPOSE: The purpose of 
      this study was to assess the psychometric properties of hereditary retinal 
      disease QoL item banks using Rasch analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of 
      a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system in obtaining precise measurement of 
      QoL using only a few items. METHODS: The hereditary retinal disease item banks 
      were answered by 233 participants (median age, 58 years; range, 18 to 94 years; 
      female participants, 59%). The hereditary retinal disease item banks cover 10 QoL 
      domains: activity limitation, mobility, emotional, social, convenience, economic, 
      health concerns, visual symptoms, ocular comfort symptoms, and general symptoms. 
      Rasch analysis assessed the psychometric properties of the 10 item banks and 
      provided item calibrations for the development of CAT. Computerized adaptive 
      testing simulations were performed to calculate the average number of items 
      required to gain precise measurement of each QoL domain. RESULTS: The 
      convenience, economic, visual symptoms, and the social domains formed 
      unidimensional scales. However, the activity limitation and health concerns 
      domains demonstrated multidimensionality and required major modifications to 
      resolve this, which resulted in four new QoL domains, namely, reading, driving, 
      lighting, and concerns about the disease progression. In total, 10 item banks 
      underwent CAT simulation testing, which indicated that 8 to 12 items were 
      required to gain precise measurement of each QoL domain. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      developed 10 psychometrically valid item banks to measure the QoL domains 
      relevant to people with hereditary retinal diseases. On average, only 5 and 10 
      items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, 
      respectively.

TI  - Psychiatrists' Attitudes Toward Disruptive New Technologies: Mixed-Methods Study.
PG  - e10240

LID - e10240
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent discoveries in the fields of machine learning (ML), Ecological 
      Momentary Assessment (EMA), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), digital 
      phenotype, imaging, and biomarkers have brought about a new paradigm shift in 
      medicine. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore psychiatrists' 
      perspectives on this paradigm through the prism of new clinical decision support 
      systems (CDSSs). Our primary objective was to assess the acceptability of these 
      new technologies. Our secondary objective was to characterize the factors 
      affecting their acceptability. METHODS: A sample of psychiatrists was recruited 
      through a mailing list. Respondents completed a Web-based survey. A quantitative 
      study with an original form of assessment involving the screenplay method was 
      implemented involving 3 scenarios, each featuring 1 of the 3 support systems, 
      namely, EMA and CAT, biosensors comprising a connected wristband-based digital 
      phenotype, and an ML-based blood test or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We 
      investigated 4 acceptability domains based on International Organization for 
      Standardization and Nielsen models (usefulness, usability, reliability, and 
      risk). RESULTS: We recorded 515 observations. Regarding our primary objective, 
      overall acceptability was moderate. MRI coupled with ML was considered to be the 
      most useful system, and the connected wristband was considered the least. All the 
      systems were described as risky (410/515, 79.6%). Regarding our secondary 
      objective, acceptability was strongly influenced by socioepidemiological 
      variables (professional culture), such as gender, age, and theoretical approach. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess psychiatrists' views on new CDSSs. 
      Data revealed moderate acceptability, but our analysis shows that this is more 
      the result of the lack of knowledge about these new technologies rather than a 
      strong rejection. Furthermore, we found strong correspondences between 
      acceptability profiles and professional culture profiles. Many medical, 
      forensics, and ethical issues were raised, including therapeutic relationship, 
      data security, data storage, and privacy risk. It is essential for psychiatrists 
      to receive training and become involved in the development of new technologies.

TI  - The influence of mental health on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) and traditional outcome instruments in patients with 
      symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      assessment includes computerized adaptive tests (CATs) that assess function, 
      pain, depression, and anxiety. The influence of mental health on patients' 
      self-reported pain and function has not been explored using PROMIS in patients 
      with symptomatic glenohumeral osteoarthritis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study 
      included 284 shoulders in 276 patients presenting with isolated glenohumeral 
      osteoarthritis. All patients completed the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
      (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), and 
      PROMIS CATs at the time of presentation. PROMIS anxiety and depression scores 
      were converted into Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9 scores, respectively, using the PROsetta Stone "crosswalk" tool. 
      Mean pain and functional scores were compared between patients with and without 
      PROMIS-converted scores corresponding to a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, as 
      well as between scores corresponding to varying degrees of anxiety or depression. 
      RESULTS: Patients with scores corresponding to a diagnosis of anxiety or 
      depression reported lower functional and higher pain scores compared to those 
      with scores in the normal range (P < .001). Analysis of variance showed 
      progressively lower functional and higher pain scores as anxiety severity 
      increased (P < .001). Similar results were seen with ASES, upper extremity CAT, 
      and pain scores as depression severity increased (P < .001). Functional ASES (P = 
      .004), SST (P < .001), and physical function CAT (P = .002) scores were 
      statistically significantly lower in patients with moderate to severe depression 
      than those without depression or with mild depression. DISCUSSION: In patients 
      with glenohumeral osteoarthritis, PROMIS-reported anxiety and depression scores, 
      particularly in those with moderate-to-severe scores, correlate with lower 
      functional and higher pain scores. Further investigation is necessary to examine 
      the influence that mental health has on outcomes after operative intervention in 
      this population.

TI  - Integrate multiple traits to detect novel trait-gene association using GWAS 
      summary data with an adaptive test approach.
PG  - 2251-2257
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty961 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring 
      treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this 
      goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed 
      in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits 
      and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of 
      disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of 
      the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical 
      use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and 
      the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic 
      variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often 
      measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic 
      variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power 
      by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to 
      develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary 
      data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS 
      phenotype and genotype data. RESULTS: Many existing GWAS summary data-based 
      association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo 
      approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for 
      efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and 
      efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix 
      using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based 
      association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power 
      when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and 
      otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by 
      optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve 
      robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical 
      algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without 
      the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods 
      through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids 
      and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by 
      individual trait-based association test. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All the 
      proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at 
      http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely 
      efficient: it takes less than 2 min to compute the list of genome-wide 
      significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait 
      tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux 
      desktop. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at 
      Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to 
      measure symptom burden reported by patients with brain tumors.
PG  - e27526
LID - 10.1002/pbc.27526 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with brain tumors can experience symptom burden throughout 
      their disease continuum. The aim of the study was to evaluate symptom burden 
      reported by children with brain tumors and factors that potentially were 
      associated with their symptoms. METHODS: Data from 199 children with brain tumors 
      aged 7-22 (mean age = 14 years; 52% males; 76% white) were analyzed. Symptom 
      burden was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) via computerized adaptive testing (CAT)-anxiety, depression, 
      fatigue, mobility, upper extremity function, peer relationship, and cognition. 
      Patients and parents completed Symptom Distress Scales (SDS). Test statistics and 
      ANOVA were used to evaluate relationships between PROMIS measures and potentially 
      influential variables. RESULTS: Significant results (P < 0.01) showing impact of 
      symptom burden included: PROMIS measures correlated with SDSs reported by 
      patients and parents on all comparisons. Fatigue, mobility, and upper extremity 
      function were associated with Karnofsky functional performance status, number of 
      treatment modalities (0-3), and time since last treatment (</=1 year, >1 year). 
      Fatigue and cognition were associated with educational program (regular classroom 
      without an individualized education plan vs those that had an individualized 
      education plan); mobility and upper extremity function were associated with time 
      since last radiation. Mobility, upper extremity function, and anxiety were 
      associated with time since last chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Significant 
      associations were found between PROMIS and SDS as well as clinical and 
      demographic characteristics. Brief-yet-precise PROMIS CATs can be used to 
      systematically assess symptom burden experienced by children with brain tumors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most important aspects of designing a clinical trial is 
      selecting appropriate outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can provide a 
      personal assessment of the burden and impact of a malignant disease and its 
      treatment. PROs comprise a wide range of outcomes including basic clinical 
      symptom scores and complex metrics such as health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL). There is limited data on how postoperative complications following 
      cancer surgery affect symptoms and HRQoL. For this reason the primary aim of the 
      PATRONUS study is to investigate how perioperative complications affect 
      cancer-related symptoms and HRQoL in patients undergoing abdominal cancer 
      surgery. The PATRONUS study is designed and will be initiated and conducted by 
      medical students under the direct supervision of clinician scientists based on 
      the concept of inquiry-based learning. METHODS: PATRONUS is a non-interventional 
      prospective multicentre cohort study. Patients undergoing elective oncological 
      abdominal surgery will be recruited at regional centres of the clinical network 
      of the German Surgical Society (CHIR-Net) and associated hospitals. A core set of 
      12 cancer associated symptoms will be assessed via the PRO version of the Common 
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The cancer-specific HRQoL will be 
      measured via the computerised adaptive testing version of the European 
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. PROs will be 
      measured eight times over a period of six months. The short-term clinical outcome 
      measure is the rate of postoperative complications (grade II to V) within 30 days 
      according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The long-term clinical outcome is 
      overall survival within six months postoperative. DISCUSSION: PATRONUS will 
      provide essential insights into the patients' assessment of their well-being and 
      quality of life in direct relation to clinical outcome parameters following 
      abdominal cancer surgery. Furthermore, PATRONUS will investigate the feasibility 
      of multicentre student-led clinical research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical 
      Trials Register: DRKS00013035 (registered on October 26, 2017). Universal Trial 
      Number (UTN): U1111-1202-8863.

TI  - The Effect of Increased Cognitive Demand on Auditory Processing Assessment.
PG  - 788-801
LID - 10.3766/jaaa.16152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Auditory processing (AP) is commonly regarded as the perceptual 
      processing of auditory information in the central nervous system. However, the 
      degree to which higher level cognitive processes are involved in AP or its 
      disorders is contentious. Furthermore, there is little evidence regarding the 
      effects of nonauditory cognitive processes on the various tests of AP in common 
      clinical usage and thus on clinical diagnoses of auditory processing disorder. 
      PURPOSE: To determine the effects of increased cognitive demand, generated by 
      using a dual-task paradigm, on performance on different AP tests and types of AP 
      tests in common clinical usage. In addition, to investigate the relationship 
      between executive function and changes in AP test performance associated with 
      increased cognitive demand. RESEARCH DESIGN: Counterbalanced repeated measures 
      design, with assessment of AP test performance both on its own and in a dual-task 
      paradigm designed to increase cognitive demand. STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-nine young 
      adults, with no reported hearing, learning, language or attention difficulties, 
      English as first language, and hearing and middle-ear status within normal 
      limits. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Testing was completed within a single 
      90-min session. A selection of standard AP tests, representing both adaptive and 
      nonadaptive tests, as well as tests employing difference scores, was 
      administered. These were Competing Sentences Test, Dichotic Digits Test, 
      Frequency Pattern Test (nonadaptive tests); and Listening in Spatialized 
      Noise-Sentences test, conditions "same-voice, 0 degrees ", "different-voice, 0 degrees ", and 
      "same-voice, 90 degrees " (adaptive tests), from which the difference scores "talker 
      advantage" and "spatial advantage" were also derived. Each AP test was completed 
      on its own (alone condition), and simultaneously with a visually presented task 
      (dual-task condition). Executive function was assessed using the phonemic subtest 
      of the Verbal Fluency Test. Nonparametric statistical test procedures were used. 
      RESULTS: All five AP measures obtained from the nonadaptive tests showed a 
      significant performance decrement in the dual-task condition compared with the 
      alone condition, with one exception because of a strong ceiling effect. By 
      contrast, none of the three AP measures obtained from the adaptive tests showed a 
      significant performance decrement in the dual-task condition. Furthermore, 
      neither of the two AP measures based on difference scores showed a significant 
      performance decrement, but this finding simply reflects the lack of significant 
      decrements in the relevant raw scores. Consistent with past reports of 
      associations between executive function and AP performance, a significant 
      positive correlation was found between executive function scores and performance 
      on the Dichotic Digits Test. However, there were no significant correlations 
      between executive function scores and changes in AP test scores between alone and 
      dual-task conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Performance on commonly used nonadaptive tests 
      of AP was significantly compromised by the increased cognitive demand resulting 
      from the dual-task paradigm. By contrast, performance on AP measures obtained by 
      adaptive test procedures was not significantly affected. Further investigation of 
      the resilience to increased cognitive demand of the adaptive tests used here, and 
      other adaptive tests of AP, is warranted. Results from this study support the 
      further development of computerized adaptive tests of AP for use in clinical test 
      batteries.

TI  - Powerful and efficient SNP-set association tests across multiple phenotypes using 
      GWAS summary data.
PG  - 1366-1372
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty811 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Many GWAS conducted in the past decade have identified tens of 
      thousands of disease related variants, which in total explained only part of the 
      heritability for most traits. There remain many more genetics variants with small 
      effect sizes to be discovered. This has motivated the development of sequencing 
      studies with larger sample sizes and increased resolution of genotyped variants, 
      e.g., the ongoing NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) whole genome 
      sequencing project. An alternative approach is the development of novel and more 
      powerful statistical methods. The current dominating approach in the field of 
      GWAS analysis is the "single trait single variant" association test, despite the 
      fact that most GWAS are conducted in deeply-phenotyped cohorts with many 
      correlated traits measured. In this paper, we aim to develop rigorous methods 
      that integrate multiple correlated traits and multiple variants to improve the 
      power to detect novel variants. In recognition of the difficulty of accessing raw 
      genotype and phenotype data due to privacy and logistic concerns, we develop 
      methods that are applicable to publicly available GWAS summary data. RESULTS: We 
      build rigorous statistical models for GWAS summary statistics to motivate novel 
      multi-trait SNP-set association tests, including variance component test, burden 
      test and their adaptive test, and develop efficient numerical algorithms to 
      quickly compute their analytical P-values. We implement the proposed methods in 
      an open source R package. We conduct thorough simulation studies to verify the 
      proposed methods rigorously control type I errors at the genome-wide significance 
      level, and further demonstrate their utility via comprehensive analysis of GWAS 
      summary data for multiple lipids traits and glycemic traits. We identified many 
      novel loci that were not detected by the individual trait based GWAS analysis. 
      AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We have implemented the proposed methods in an R 
      package freely available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MSKAT. SUPPLEMENTARY 
      INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have social and 
      communication deficits that impair their involvement in family life. No measures 
      of child involvement in the family have been validated for the ASD population. 
      AIM: To evaluate the validity of a measure of Family Involvement (FI) of children 
      ages 5-12 with ASD. METHOD: Parents of children ages 5-12 with ASD (n = 114) 
      completed FI items from the PROMIS(R) pediatric Family Relationships item bank in 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format, as well as measures of ASD symptom 
      burden, parenting stress, and parental depression. Medical record review provided 
      child intelligence or developmental quotient. A reference sample (n = 236) 
      closely matching the ASD sample in age and gender was created from the national 
      standardization sample, and underwent a simulated CAT. RESULTS: The CAT precisely 
      and efficiently measured parent-reported FI of children with ASD. Average FI 
      scores were lower among children with ASD (M = 46.3, SD = 7.1) than children in 
      the reference sample (M = 52.5, SD = 9.1). A "dose response" decrease in FI was 
      observed as ASD severity increased. Increased parenting stress was associated 
      with lower FI. No relationship between FI and child IQ was found. CONCLUSION: The 
      FI items captured FI among children ages 5-12 with ASD with acceptable precision. 
      Reduced FI among children with ASD, particularly those with higher symptom 
      severity, suggests validity of the items in this population.

TI  - The Development of a New Computer Adaptive Test to Evaluate Feelings of Being

      Feeling Trapped Item Bank.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new patient-reported outcome measure that captures 
      feelings of being trapped that are commonly experienced by caregivers of 
      individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: 
      Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and 
      a military medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of 
      civilians with TBI (n=344) and caregivers of service members/veterans with TBI 
      (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. OUTCOME MEASURES: Traumatic Brain Injury 
      Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Feeling Trapped item bank. RESULTS: From 
      an initial item pool of 28 items, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses 
      supported the retention of 16 items. After graded response model (GRM) and 
      differential item functioning analyses were conducted, 15 items were retained in 
      the final measure. GRM calibration data, along with clinical expert input, were 
      used to choose a 6-item, static short form (SF), and the calibration data were 
      used for programming of the TBI-CareQOL Feeling Trapped computer adaptive test 
      (CAT). CAT simulation analyses produced an r=0.99 correlation between CAT scores 
      and the full item bank. Three-week short-form test-retest reliability was very 
      good (r=0.84). CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Feeling Trapped item bank was 
      developed to provide a sensitive and efficient examination of the effect that 
      feelings of being trapped, due to the caregiver role, have on health-related 
      quality of life for caregivers of individuals with TBI. Both the CAT and 
      corresponding 6-item SF demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. Future 
      work is needed to establish the responsiveness of this measure to clinical 
      interventions for these caregivers.

TI  - Preoperative Opioid Use in Knee Surgery Patients.
PG  - 630-636
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1666868 [doi]
AB  - A cross-sectional analysis of data derived from patients undergoing knee surgery 
      at a single institution was conducted. The objectives of the study were to 
      determine the demographic, diagnostic, and psychologic factors associated with 
      opioid use; and to determine the clinical correlates of opioid use. We 
      hypothesized that preoperative opioid use would be associated with worse 
      patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. The sample consisted of 383 patients 
      undergoing knee surgery. The patients were classified as either opioid or 
      nonopioid users on the basis of medical record review. All participants completed 
      a battery of clinical assessments, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System computer adaptive testing in six domains: Physical 
      Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Social Satisfaction, Anxiety, and 
      Depression. Analyses were conducted to examine clinical variables as a function 
      of opioid use. The results indicated that opioid use was associated with female 
      gender, unemployment, smoking, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      scores, greater number of previous surgeries, depression or anxiety, and worse 
      expectation of surgery (p < 0.05). Multivariable analysis found opioid use to be 
      a significant independent predictor of multiple PRO measures in patients 
      undergoing knee surgery. Potential explanations for these findings are presented, 
      and clinical implications are discussed.

TI  - A Conceptual Model of Angelman Syndrome and Review of Relevant Clinical Outcomes 
      Assessments (COAs).
PG  - 97-112
LID - 10.1007/s40271-018-0323-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare, neurological genetic disorder for 
      which no clinical outcomes assessments (COAs) or conceptual models (CM) have been 
      developed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify symptoms and impacts relevant 
      and important in this patient population and develop a conceptual model of AS, 
      and to evaluate the content validity of selected COA instruments with potential 
      for inclusion in clinical studies of AS to capture treatment benefit. METHODS: 
      For both concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive interviews (CI), caregivers of 
      children, adolescents, and adults with AS and clinicians with AS experience were 
      targeted. For CI, clinicians discussed the Modified Performance-Oriented Mobility 
      Assessment (MPOMA-G) and ProtoKinetics Zeno Walkway and caregivers reviewed the 
      Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT), 
      the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS), the Aberrant Behavior 
      Checklist-Community (ABC-C), and the Morning Diary. RESULTS: Four clinicians and 
      34 caregivers participated in CE interviews; three clinicians and 36 caregivers 
      participated in CI. A conceptual model, initially informed by literature, was 
      refined based on interview data. Five domains of symptoms, signs, and 
      characteristics of AS were identified: cognitive and executive functioning, 
      social-emotional, emotional-expressive behavior, sensory-compulsive behavior, and 
      physical. Patient impacts were identified in three domains: activities of daily 
      living, school, and social/community. Caregiver impacts were identified in five 
      domains: mental health, physical health, work, home, and social. While all 
      instruments demonstrated the ability to provide relevant data for the AS 
      population, each instrument either contained some items irrelevant to individuals 
      with AS or was missing important concepts based on the interviews. No single 
      instrument covered all relevant domains specific to AS. CONCLUSION: Future work 
      should consider the adaptation of existing COAs and the development of a novel 
      AS-specific instrument for use in clinical research to ensure outcomes important 
      to this patient population are captured.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new measure of caregiver strain for use in caregivers of 
      individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver 
      Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Caregiver Strain. DESIGN: Qualitative data, 
      literature reviews, and cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model 
      Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military 
      medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of civilians (n=344) 
      or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: Not 
      applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain Item Bank. 
      RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, a graded response model 
      (GRM) and differential item functioning supported the retention of 33 items in 
      the final measure. GRM calibration data was used to inform the selection of a 
      6-item static short form, and to program the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain 
      computer-adaptive test (CAT). CAT simulation analyses indicated a 0.97 
      correlation between the CAT scores and the full item-bank. Three-week test-retest 
      reliability was strong (r=0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver 
      Strain CAT and corresponding 6-item short form were developed using established 
      rigorous measurement development standards; this is the first self-reported 
      measure developed to evaluate caregiver strain in caregivers of individuals with 
      TBI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop new patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to better 
      understand feelings of loss in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model 
      Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military 
      medical treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=560) of civilians with 
      TBI (n=344) or service members/veterans (SMVs) with TBI (n=216). INTERVENTIONS: 
      Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality 
      of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Feelings of Loss-Self and TBI-CareQOL Feelings of 
      Loss-Person with Traumatic Brain Injury item banks. RESULTS: While the initial 
      exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the feelings of loss item pool 
      (98 items) potentially supported a unidimensional set of items, further analysis 
      indicated 2 different factors: Feelings of Loss-Self (43 items) and Feelings of 
      Loss-Person with TBI (20 items). For Feelings of Loss-Self, an additional 13 
      items were deleted due to item-response theory-based item misfit; the remaining 
      30 items had good overall model fit (comparative fit index [CFI]=0.96, 
      Tucker-Lewis index [TLI]=.96, root mean squared error of approximation 
      [RMSEA]=.10). For Feelings of Loss-Other, 1 additional item was deleted due to an 
      associated high correlated error modification index value; the final 19 items 
      evidenced good overall model fit (CFI=0.97, TLI=.97, RMSEA=.095). The final item 
      banks were developed to be administered as either a Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) 
      or a short-form (SF). Clinical experts approved the content of the 6-item SFs of 
      the 2 measures (3-week test-retest was r=.87 for Feelings of Loss-Self and r=.85 
      for Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study 
      resulted in the development of 2 new PROs to assess feelings of loss in 
      caregivers of individuals with TBI; TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Self and 
      TBI-CareQOL Feelings of Loss-Person with TBI. Good psychometric properties were 
      established and an SF was developed for ease of use in clinical situations. 
      Additional research is needed to determine concurrent and predictive validity of 
      these measures in the psychological treatment of those caring for persons with 
      TBI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design a new measure of caregiver-specific anxiety for use in 
      caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), the Traumatic Brain 
      Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Caregiver-Specific Anxiety item 
      bank. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Three TBI Model Systems 
      rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical 
      treatment facility. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty-four caregivers of 
      civilians with TBI and 216 caregivers of service members/veterans with TBI 
      (N=560). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TBI-CareQOL 
      Caregiver-Specific Anxiety item bank. RESULTS: The retention of 40 
      Caregiver-Specific Anxiety items was supported by exploratory and confirmatory 
      factor analyses. Graded response model (GRM) and differential item functioning 
      analyses supported the retention of 33 items in the final measure. Expert review 
      and GRM calibration data was used to select a 6-item static short form, and GRM 
      calibration data was used to program the TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific Anxiety 
      computer adaptive test (CAT). CONCLUSIONS: Established, rigorous measurement 
      development standards were used to develop the new TBI-CareQOL Caregiver-Specific 
      Anxiety CAT and corresponding 6-item short form. This measure is the first 
      patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess caregiver-specific anxiety in 
      caregivers of individuals with TBI. The measure exhibits strong psychometric 
      properties.

AB  - PURPOSE: Social, mental, and physical health have a complex interrelationship 
      with each influencing individuals' overall health experience. Social 
      circumstances have been shown to influence symptom intensity and magnitude of 
      disability for a variety of medical conditions. We tested the null hypothesis 
      that social deprivation would not impact Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) scores or objective health factors in patients 
      presenting for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study analyzed data from 367 patients who presented for 
      evaluation of CTS to 1 of 6 hand surgeons at a tertiary academic center between 
      August 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. Patients completed PROMIS Physical 
      Function-v1.2, Pain Interference-v1.1, Depression-v1.0, and Anxiety-v1.0 Computer 
      Adaptive Tests. The Area Deprivation Index was used to quantify social 
      deprivation. Medical record review determined duration of symptoms, tobacco and 
      opioid use, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for each patient. Sample 
      demographics, PROMIS scores, and objective health measures were compared in 
      groups defined by national quartiles of social deprivation. RESULTS: Patients 
      with CTS living in the most deprived quartile had worse mean scores across all 4 
      PROMIS domains compared with those living in the least deprived quartile. A 
      higher proportion of individuals from the most deprived quartile had a heightened 
      level of anxiety than those in the least deprived quartile (37.3% vs 12.6%). The 
      mean CCI was higher in the most deprived quartile, as was the proportion of 
      individuals using tobacco. There were no differences in opioid use or symptom 
      duration between patients from each deprivation quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Social 
      deprivation is associated with worse patient-reported health measures in patients 
      with CTS. Compared with those from the least deprived areas, patients from the 
      most deprived areas also have a greater comorbidity burden and higher rates of 
      tobacco use at presentation to a hand surgeon. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Prognostic II.

LID - 10.1016/j.jhsa.2018.04.028 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Surgery for nontraumatic upper-extremity problems is largely 
      discretionary and preference-sensitive. Psychological and social determinants of 
      health correlate with greater symptoms and limitations and might be associated 
      with discretionary operative treatment. METHODS: We used routinely collected 
      patient-reported outcome measures from patients with de Quervain tendinopathy, 
      ganglion cyst, trapeziometacarpal arthritis, trigger digit, and carpal tunnel 
      syndrome to study factors associated with discretionary surgery using multiple 
      logistic regression. Patients completed a measure of the magnitude of physical 
      limitations (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] 
      Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Test [CAT]), a measure of the degree to 
      which a person limits activities owing to pain (PROMIS Pain Interference CAT), 
      and a measure of symptoms of depression (PROMIS Depression CAT) at every office 
      visit. RESULTS: Higher PROMIS Pain Interference score, diagnoses of carpal tunnel 
      syndrome, and treatment by teams 3, 4, or 5 were independently associated with 
      discretionary operative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: People with a greater tendency to 
      limit activity owing to pain are more likely to choose discretionary surgery. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interventions that help people remain active despite pain by 
      addressing the psychological and social determinants of health might affect the 
      rate of discretionary surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether positively or 
      negatively phrased Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) prior to a visit 
      with the hand surgeon affect patient perceived empathy and patient satisfaction 
      (Patient-Reported Experience Measures [PREMs]). METHODS: Between June 2017 and 
      July 2017, we enrolled 134 patients who presented to 3 hand surgeons at 2 
      outpatient offices. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: completion of 
      negatively framed questionnaires (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2], Pain 
      Catastrophizing Scale [PCS-4], and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System [PROMIS] depression Computer Adaptive Test [CAT]) or 
      completion of positively framed questionnaires (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire 
      [PSEQ-2]) prior to the visit. At the end of the visit, all patients completed 
      questionnaires on patient-perceived physician empathy and patient satisfaction. 
      Five patients were excluded from the analysis after randomization. RESULTS: There 
      was no statistically significant differences between groups on patient-perceived 
      physician empathy and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest 
      that the content of psychological questionnaires completed prior to the visit 
      does not affect patient satisfaction and perceived empathy recorded after the 
      visit. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Given the degree to which PROMs are influenced by 
      psychosocial factors, and prior evidence that PROMs are primed by negatively 
      framed questionnaires, it is reassuring that negatively framed PROMs did not 
      affect PREMs, but more research is merited.

TI  - Is a Computerized Adaptive Test More Motivating Than a Fixed-Item Test?
PG  - 495-511
LID - 10.1177/0146621617707556 [doi]
AB  - Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional 
      fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to 
      adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker 
      engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from 
      the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer 
      correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this 
      possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in 
      the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible 
      effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test 
      anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a 
      mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, 
      or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the 
      correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. 
      The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than 
      either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in 
      performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly 
      higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In 
      addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the 
      state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in 
      adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item 
      tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous 
      studies.

TI  - A Smart Screening Device for Patients with Mental Health Problems in Primary 
      Health Care: Development and Pilot Study.
PG  - e41
LID - 10.2196/mental.9488 [doi]
LID - e41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate recognition of mental health problems is a prerequisite for 
      successful treatment. Although most people tend to consult their general 
      practitioner (GP) when they first experience mental health problems, GPs are not 
      very well equipped to screen for various forms of psychopathology to help them 
      determine clients' need for treatment. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the development 
      and characteristics of CATja, a computerized adaptive test battery built to 
      facilitate triage in primary care settings, are described, and first results of 
      its implementation are reported. METHODS: CATja was developed in close 
      collaboration with GPs and mental health assistants (MHAs). During 
      implementation, MHAs were requested to appraise clients' rankings (N=91) on the 
      domains to be tested and to indicate the treatment level they deemed most 
      appropriate for clients before test administration. We compared the agreement 
      between domain score appraisals and domain score computed by CATja and the 
      agreement between initial (before test administration) treatment level advice and 
      final treatment level advice. RESULTS: Agreements (Cohen kappas) between MHAs' 
      appraisals of clients' scores and clients' scores computed by CATja were mostly 
      between .40 and .50 (Cohen kappas=.10-.20), and the agreement between "initial" 
      treatment levels and the final treatment level advised was .65 (Cohen kappa=.55). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using CATja, caregivers can efficiently generate summaries of their 
      clients' mental well-being on which decisions about treatment type and care level 
      may be based. Further validation research is needed.

TI  - Depression and Pain Interference Correlate With Physical Function in Patients 
      Recovering From Hand Surgery.
PG  - 830-835
LID - 10.1177/1558944718777814 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patient-reported outcome measures vary more than expected based on 
      underlying pathology, in part due to the substantial influence of mood and coping 
      strategies. Methods: This study addressed the primary null hypothesis that the 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical 
      Function score 1 month (range, 3-8 weeks) after hand surgery is not associated 
      with PROMIS Depression and PROMIS Pain Interference scores prior to surgery, 
      accounting for other factors. Using an institution-wide database of routinely 
      collected patient-reported outcomes, we identified adult patients who underwent 
      wrist ganglion excision, trapeziometacarpal arthroplasty, hand ganglion excision, 
      trigger digit, De Quervain, and carpal tunnel release. Measures collected 
      included the PROMIS Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT), PROMIS 
      Pain Interference CAT, and PROMIS Depression CAT. We sought factors associated 
      with postsurgical PROMIS Physical Function scores and change between preoperative 
      and postoperative score using multivariable linear regression, accounting for 
      age, sex, surgery type, provider, and time from surgery to postsurgical 
      measurement. Results: Higher postoperative PROMIS Physical Function score was 
      independently associated with lower PROMIS Pain Interference scores, lower PROMIS 
      Depression scores, younger age, and treatment by provider team 3. Greater change 
      in PROMIS Physical Function score was independently associated with greater 
      PROMIS Pain Interference scores, greater time from surgery, and treatment by 
      provider team 3. Conclusions: Mood and effective coping strategies affect the 
      level of symptoms and limitations during recovery from hand surgery and represent 
      important treatment opportunities for enhancing recovery.

AB  - We examined cultural differences in the item characteristic functions of 
      self-reported of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mania-hypomania in a Latino 
      population taking Computerized Adaptive Tests for Mental Health (CAT-MH) in 
      Spanish versus a non-Latino sample taking the tests in English. We studied 
      differential item functioning (DIF) of the most common adaptively administered 
      symptom items out of a bank of 1,008 items between Latino (n = 1276) and 
      non-Latino (n = 798) subjects. For depression, we identified 4 items with DIF 
      that were good discriminators for non-Latinos but poor discriminators for 
      Latinos. These items were related to cheerfulness, life satisfaction, 
      concentration, and fatigue. The correlation between the original calibration and 
      a Latino-only new calibration after eliminating these items was r = .990. For 
      anxiety, no items with DIF were identified. The correlation between the original 
      and new calibrations was r = .993. For mania-hypomania, we identified 4 items 
      with differential item functioning that were good discriminators for non-Latinos 
      but poor discriminators for Latinos. These items were related to risk-taking, 
      self-assurance, and sexual activity. The correlation between the original and new 
      calibration was r = .962. Once the identified items were removed, the correlation 
      between the original calibration and a Latino-only calibration was r = .96 or 
      greater. These findings reveal that the CAT-MH can be reliably used to measure 
      depression, anxiety, and mania in Latinos taking these tests in Spanish.

TI  - Anxiety in the orthopedic patient: using PROMIS to assess mental health.
PG  - 2275-2282
LID - 10.1007/s11136-018-1867-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored the performance of the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety assessment relative to the 
      Depression assessment in orthopedic patients, the relationship between Anxiety 
      with self-reported Physical Function and Pain Interference, and to determine if 
      Anxiety levels varied according to the location of orthopedic conditions. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional evaluation analyzed 14,962 consecutive adult 
      new-patient visits to a tertiary orthopedic practice between 4/1/2016 and 
      12/31/2016. All patients completed PROMIS Anxiety, Depression, Physical Function, 
      and Pain Interference computer adaptive tests (CATs) as routine clinical intake. 
      Patients were grouped by the orthopedic service providing care and categorized as 
      either affected with Anxiety if scoring > 62 based on linkage to the Generalized 
      Anxiety Disorder-7 survey. Spearman correlations between the PROMIS scores were 
      calculated. Bivariate statistics assessed differences in Anxiety and Depression 
      scores between patients of different orthopedic services. RESULTS: 20% of 
      patients scored above the threshold to be considered affected by Anxiety. PROMIS 
      Anxiety scores demonstrated a stronger correlation than Depression scores with 
      Physical Function and Pain Interference scores. Patients with spine conditions 
      reported the highest median Anxiety scores and were more likely to exceed the 
      Anxiety threshold than patients presenting to sports or upper extremity surgeons. 
      CONCLUSIONS: One in five new orthopedic patients reports Anxiety levels that may 
      warrant intervention. This rate is heightened in patients needing spine care. 
      Patient-reported Physical Function more strongly correlates with PROMIS Anxiety 
      than Depression suggesting that the Anxiety CAT is a valuable addition to assess 
      mental health among orthopedic patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic level III.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our understanding of the coping strategies used by people with visual 
      impairment to manage stress related to visual loss is limited. This study aims to 
      develop a sophisticated coping instrument in the form of an item bank implemented 
      via Computerised adaptive testing (CAT) for hereditary retinal diseases. METHODS: 
      Items on coping were extracted from qualitative interviews with patients which 
      were supplemented by items from a literature review. A systematic multi-stage 
      process of item refinement was carried out followed by expert panel discussion 
      and cognitive interviews. The final coping item bank had 30 items. Rasch analysis 
      was used to assess the psychometric properties. A CAT simulation was carried out 
      to estimate an average number of items required to gain precise measurement of 
      hereditary retinal disease-related coping. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine 
      participants answered the coping item bank (median age = 58 years). The coping 
      scale demonstrated good precision and targeting. The standardised residual 
      loadings for items revealed six items grouped together. Removal of the six items 
      reduced the precision of the main coping scale and worsened the variance 
      explained by the measure. Therefore, the six items were retained within the main 
      scale. Our CAT simulation indicated that, on average, less than 10 items are 
      required to gain a precise measurement of coping. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first 
      study to develop a psychometrically robust coping instrument for hereditary 
      retinal diseases. CAT simulation indicated that on an average, only four and nine 
      items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, 
      respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The inefficiency associated with collecting standard validated 
      instruments has been a barrier to routine use. We utilized computer adaptive 
      testing (CAT) instruments available through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) and correlated these with the Oswestry Disability 
      Index (ODI). METHODS: All measurements were collected at a routine chiropractic 
      visit. The ODI assessment was used for comparison as a widely used patient 
      reported outcomes instrument. RESULTS: The average time to complete all questions 
      during an office visit was 170 +/- 67 s (average +/- Stdev) to answer 25 +/- 6 
      questions. Regression analysis revealed a good linear fit between ODI and both 
      PROMIS pain behavior and physical function with R(2) values of 0.5219 and 0.6754 
      respectively, and a good linear fit between anxiety and depression with R(2) 
      values of 0.5236. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CAT instruments can be efficiently 
      administered during routine clinical visits and correlations values found 
      validate the utility when compared to ODI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop the first item bank to measure stress resilience (SR) in 
      clinical populations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative item development 
      resulted in an initial pool of 131 items covering a broad theoretical SR concept. 
      These items were tested in n = 521 patients at a psychosomatic outpatient clinic. 
      Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, as well as other state-of-the-art 
      item analyses and item response theory were used for item evaluation and 
      calibration of the final item bank. RESULTS: Of the initial item pool of 131 
      items, we excluded 64 items (54 factor loading <0.5, four residual correlations 
      >0.3, two nondiscriminative item response curves, and four differential item 
      functioning). The final set of 67 items indicated sufficient model fit in 
      confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory analyses. In addition, a 
      10-item short form with high measurement precision (SE </= 0.32 in a theta range 
      between -1.8 and +1.5) was derived. Both the SR item bank and the SR short form 
      were highly correlated with an existing static legacy tool (Connor-Davidson 
      Resilience Scale). CONCLUSION: The final SR item bank and 10-item short form 
      showed good psychometric properties. When further validated, they will be ready 
      to be used within a framework of computer-adaptive tests for a comprehensive 
      assessment of the stress construct.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying predictors of generic health-related 
      quality of life (HRQoL) in chronically ill children and adolescents over time. 
      The newly developed computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT was used to assess five 
      dimensions of HRQoL. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Kids-CAT study on 
      children and adolescents with asthma, diabetes and juvenile arthritis (n = 248; 
      aged 7-17 years) were assessed at three measurement points over six months. 
      Individual growth modeling served to investigate effects of sociodemographic, 
      disease- and health-related as well as psychosocial factors on HRQoL dimensions 
      Physical Well-Being (WB), Psychological WB, Parent Relations, Social Support & 
      Peers, and School WB over time. RESULTS: Besides effects of sociodemographic 
      variables on HRQoL dimensions Social Support & Peers as well as School WB, we 
      found that a longer duration of the disease was associated with better Physical 
      WB. Lower scores were found for patients with juvenile arthritis compared to 
      those with diabetes in HRQoL dimensions Physical WB and Social Support & Peers. 
      Disease control was positively related to Physical and Psychological WB over 
      time. Mental health problems were negatively associated with four, and subjective 
      health complaints with all five HRQoL dimensions over time. Parental mental 
      health was positively related to the patients' HRQoL score in Parent Relations 
      over time. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL as a multidimensional construct is associated with 
      a wide range of different factors. Pediatricians should consider potential mental 
      health problems and subjective health complaints in their patients. Finally, 
      parental HRQoL can affect HRQoL in chronically ill children and adolescents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research documents that greater psychologic distress 
      (anxiety/depression) and less effective coping strategies (catastrophic thinking, 
      kinesophobia) are associated with greater pain intensity and greater limitations. 
      Recognition and acknowledgment of verbal and nonverbal indicators of psychologic 
      factors might raise opportunities for improved psychologic health. There is 
      evidence that specific patient words and phrases indicate greater catastrophic 
      thinking. This study tested proposed nonverbal indicators (such as flexion of the 
      wrist during attempted finger flexion or extension of uninjured fingers as the 
      stiff and painful finger is flexed) for their association with catastrophic 
      thinking. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do patients with specific protective hand 
      postures during physical examination have greater pain interference (limitation 
      of activity in response to nociception), limitations, symptoms of depression, 
      catastrophic thinking (protectiveness, preparation for the worst), and 
      kinesophobia (fear of movement)? (2) Do greater numbers of protective hand 
      postures correlate with worse scores on these measures? METHODS: Between October 
      2014 and September 2016, 156 adult patients with stiff or painful fingers within 
      2 months after sustaining a finger, hand, or wrist injury were invited to 
      participate in this study. Six patients chose not to participate as a result of 
      time constraints and one patient was excluded as a result of inconsistent scoring 
      of a possible hand posture, leaving 149 patients for analysis. We asked all 
      patients to complete a set of questionnaires and a sociodemographic survey. We 
      used Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      Depression, Upper Extremity Physical Function, and Pain Interference computer 
      adaptive test (CAT) questionnaires. We used the Abbreviated Pain Catastrophizing 
      Scale (PCS-4) to measure catastrophic thinking in response to nociception. 
      Finally, we used the Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia (TSK) to assess fear of 
      movement. The occurrence of protective hand postures during the physical 
      examination was noted by both the physician and researcher. For uncertainty or 
      disagreement, a video of the physical examination was recorded and a group 
      decision was made. RESULTS: Patients with one or more protective hand postures 
      did not score higher on the PROMIS Pain Interference CAT (hand posture: 59 
      [56-64]; no posture: 59 [54-63]; difference of medians: 0; p = 0.273), Physical 
      Function CAT (32 +/- 8 versus 34 +/- 8; mean difference: 2 [confidence interval CI, 
      -0.5 to 5]; p = 0.107), nor the Depression CAT (48 [41-55] versus 48 [42-53]; 
      difference of medians: 0; p = 0.662). However, having at least one hand posture 
      was associated with a higher degree of catastrophic thinking (PCS scores: 13 
      [6-26] versus 10 [3-16]; difference of medians: 3; p = 0.0104) and a higher level 
      of kinesophobia (TSK: 40 +/- 6 versus 38 +/- 6; mean difference: -2 [CI, -4 to -1]; p 
      = 0.0420). Greater catastrophic thinking was associated with a greater number of 
      protective hand postures on average (rho: 0.20, p = 0.0138). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Protective hand postures and (based on prior research) specific words and phrases 
      are associated with catastrophic thinking and kinesophobia, less effective coping 
      strategies that hinder recovery. Surgeons can learn to recognize these signs and 
      begin to treat catastrophic thinking and kinesophobia starting with compassion, 
      empathy, and patience and be prepared to add formal support (such as 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy) to help facilitate recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Level III, diagnostic study.

TI  - What Is the Relationship of Fear Avoidance to Physical Function and Pain 
      Intensity in Injured Athletes?
PG  - 754-763
LID - 10.1007/s11999.0000000000000085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear avoidance can play a prominent role in maladaptive responses to 
      an injury. In injured athletes, such pain-related fear or fear avoidance behavior 
      may have a substantial influence on the recovery process. Specifically, it may 
      explain why some are able to reach their preinjury abilities, whereas others are 
      unable to return to sport. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is fear avoidance in athletes 
      associated with decreased physical function after injury? (2) To what degree is 
      fear avoidance associated with athletes' pain intensity? METHODS: In a 
      cross-sectional study, we recruited injured athletes-defined as patients with 
      sports-related injury, weekly engagement in sport activities, participation in 
      competitive events as part of a team or club, self-identification as an athlete, 
      and a desire to return to sport after recovery-from an orthopaedic sports 
      medicine center at a major urban university hospital. Of 130 approached patients, 
      102 (84% men; mean +/- SD age 25 +/- 8.5 years) met the inclusion criteria. 
      Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Athlete Fear Avoidance 
      Questionnaire, which assesses injury-related fear and avoidance behavior 
      specifically in an athletic population, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and two Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System measures: Physical Function Computerized Adaptive 
      Testing (CAT) and Pain Intensity CAT. RESULTS: After controlling for age, injury 
      region (upper versus lower extremity), catastrophic thinking, and emotional 
      distress, we found that an increase in athletes' fear avoidance was associated 
      with a decrease in physical function (b = -0.32; p = 0.002). The model explained 
      30% of the variation in physical function with 7.3% explained uniquely by fear 
      avoidance. After controlling for initial appointment/followup, surgery for the 
      current condition, multiple pain conditions, history of prior sport-related 
      injury/surgery, pain medication prescription, catastrophic thinking, and 
      emotional distress, athletes' fear avoidance was not associated with pain (b = 
      -0.14; p = 0.249). The model explained 40% of the variation in pain intensity and 
      pain catastrophizing (b = 0.30; p = 0.001) uniquely explained 7.1% of this 
      variation. CONCLUSIONS: In injured athletes, fear avoidance is independently 
      associated with decreased physical function, whereas pain catastrophizing is 
      associated with high pain intensity. Both level of an athlete's fear avoidance 
      and catastrophic thinking about pain should be accounted for in clinical 
      interventions aimed at helping athletes improve recovery and return to sport. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

TI  - PROMIS depression measures perform similarly to legacy measures relative to a 
      structured diagnostic interview for depression in cancer patients.
PG  - 1357-1367
LID - 10.1007/s11136-018-1803-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the convergent validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression measures relative to legacy 
      measures and criterion validity against a structured diagnostic interview for 
      depression in an oncology sample. METHODS: 132 oncology/haematology outpatients 
      completed the PROMIS Depression Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-D-CAT) and PROMIS 
      Depression Short Form (PROMIS-D-SF) along with seven legacy measures: Beck 
      Depression Inventory (BDI); Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
      (CES-D); Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire; Distress Thermometer and PSYCH-6. 
      Correlations, area under the curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy statistics were 
      calculated with Structured Clinical Interview as the gold standard. RESULTS: Both 
      PROMIS measures correlated with all legacy measures at p < .001 (rho = 0.589-0.810) 
      and all AUCs (> 0.800) were comparable. At the cut-off points for mild depression 
      of 53, the PROMIS measures had sensitivity (0.83 for PROMIS-D-CAT and 0.80 for 
      PROMIS-D-SF) similar to or better than 6/7 legacy measures with high negative 
      predictive value (> 90%). At cut-off points of 60 for moderate depression, PROMIS 
      measures had specificity > 90%, similar to or better than all legacy measures and 
      positive predictive value >/= 0.50 (similar to 5/7 legacy measures). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The convergent and criterion validity of the PROMIS depression measures in cancer 
      populations was confirmed, although the optimal cut-off points are not 
      established. PROMIS measures were briefer than BDI-II and CES-D but do not offer 
      any advance in terms of diagnostic accuracy, reduced response burden or cost over 
      other legacy measures of depression in oncology patients.

TI  - Feasibility, Validity, and Reliability of the 10-item Patient Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System Global Health Short Form in Outpatients with 
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
PG  - 397-404
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.170590 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, validity, and reliability of the Patient 
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Short Form 
      (PROMIS10) in outpatients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: SLE 
      outpatients completed PROMIS10, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), 
      LupusQoL-US, and selected PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CAT) at routine 
      visits at an SLE Center of Excellence. Construct validity was evaluated by 
      correlating PROMIS10 physical and mental health scores with PROMIS CAT, legacy 
      instruments, and physician-derived measures of disease activity and damage. 
      Test-retest reliability was determined among subjects reporting stable SLE 
      activity at 2 assessments 1 week apart using intraclass correlation coefficients 
      (ICC). RESULTS: A diverse cohort of 204 out of 238 patients with SLE (86%) 
      completed survey instruments. PROMIS10 physical health scores strongly correlated 
      with physical function, pain, and social health domains in PROMIS CAT, SF-36, and 
      LupusQoL, while mental health scores strongly correlated with PROMIS depression 
      CAT, SF-36, and LupusQoL mental health domains (Spearman correlations >/= 0.70). 
      Active arthritis, comorbid fibromyalgia (FM), and anxiety were associated with 
      worse PROMIS10 scores, but sociodemographic factors and physician-assessed flare 
      status were not. Test-retest reliability for PROMIS10 physical and mental health 
      scores was high (ICC >/= 0.85). PROMIS10 required < 2 minutes to complete. 
      CONCLUSION: PROMIS10 is valid and reliable, and can efficiently screen for 
      impaired physical function, pain, and emotional distress in outpatients with SLE. 
      With strong correlations to LupusQoL and SF-36 but significantly reduced 
      responder burden, PROMIS10 is a promising tool for measuring patient-reported 
      outcomes in routine SLE clinical care and value-based healthcare initiatives.

TI  - A signal detection-item response theory model for evaluating neuropsychological 
      measures.
PG  - 745-760
LID - 10.1080/13803395.2018.1427699 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Models from signal detection theory are commonly used to score 
      neuropsychological test data, especially tests of recognition memory. Here we 
      show that certain item response theory models can be formulated as signal 
      detection theory models, thus linking two complementary but distinct 
      methodologies. We then use the approach to evaluate the validity (construct 
      representation) of commonly used research measures, demonstrate the impact of 
      conditional error on neuropsychological outcomes, and evaluate measurement bias. 
      METHOD: Signal detection-item response theory (SD-IRT) models were fitted to 
      recognition memory data for words, faces, and objects. The sample consisted of 
      U.S. Infantry Marines and Navy Corpsmen participating in the Marine Resiliency 
      Study. Data comprised item responses to the Penn Face Memory Test (PFMT; 
      N = 1,338), Penn Word Memory Test (PWMT; N = 1,331), and Visual Object Learning 
      Test (VOLT; N = 1,249), and self-report of past head injury with loss of 
      consciousness. RESULTS: SD-IRT models adequately fitted recognition memory item 
      data across all modalities. Error varied systematically with ability estimates, 
      and distributions of residuals from the regression of memory discrimination onto 
      self-report of past head injury were positively skewed towards regions of larger 
      measurement error. Analyses of differential item functioning revealed little 
      evidence of systematic bias by level of education. CONCLUSIONS: SD-IRT models 
      benefit from the measurement rigor of item response theory-which permits the 
      modeling of item difficulty and examinee ability-and from signal detection 
      theory-which provides an interpretive framework encompassing the experimentally 
      validated constructs of memory discrimination and response bias. We used this 
      approach to validate the construct representation of commonly used research 
      measures and to demonstrate how nonoptimized item parameters can lead to 
      erroneous conclusions when interpreting neuropsychological test data. Future work 
      might include the development of computerized adaptive tests and integration with 
      mixture and random-effects models.

TI  - Relative Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression in Patients With Upper Extremity 
      Conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE: Prior research regarding the impact of mental health on upper extremity 
      musculoskeletal function and recovery has frequently grouped catastrophizing, 
      anxiety, and depression. This study was designed to define the relative 
      prevalence of heightened anxiety versus depressive symptoms among a patient 
      population seeking upper extremity care and to determine if those prevalences 
      varied according to the symptomatic condition. METHODS: All adult patients 
      presenting to a tertiary upper extremity orthopedic center between June 1, 2016 
      and November 30, 2016 (n = 3,315) completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety and Depression Computer Adaptive 
      Tests. Descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression assessed 
      differences in average PROMIS scores between demographic and diagnostic groups. 
      Patients were also analyzed according to crossing thresholds for heightened 
      anxiety and depression scores based on established linkage tables with the 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Depression 
      scales, respectively. Pearson chi-square analysis and binary logistic regression 
      were performed to determine if the proportion of patients crossing these 
      thresholds varied according to the primary symptomatic condition while accounting 
      for patient age, sex, and race. RESULTS: African American patients and those with 
      carpal tunnel syndrome, trapeziometacarpal arthritis, or shoulder conditions 
      reported significantly higher PROMIS Anxiety scores. Higher PROMIS Depression 
      scores varied only by diagnosis. Seventeen percent of patients exceeded the 
      Anxiety symptoms score threshold and 10% of patients exceeded the Depression 
      symptom threshold. In logistic regression modeling, the likelihood of exceeding 
      the Anxiety threshold varied by diagnosis and was increased in African American 
      patients and females. African American race was associated with exceeding the 
      Depression threshold while accounting for sex and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with upper extremity conditions more frequently report heightened 
      anxiety than heightened depression. Patient race and diagnosis are independent 
      predictors of anxiety among patients seeking care for upper extremity conditions.

TI  - Functional Recovery in Critically Ill Children, the "WeeCover" Multicenter Study.
PG  - 145-154
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000001421 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate functional outcomes and evaluate predictors of an 
      unfavorable functional outcome in children following a critical illness. DESIGN: 
      Prospective observational longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Two tertiary care, 
      Canadian PICUs: McMaster Children's Hospital and London Health Sciences. 
      PATIENTS: Children 12 months to 17 years old, admitted to PICU for at least 48 
      hours with one or more organ dysfunction, were eligible. Patients not expected to 
      survive, direct transfers from neonatal ICU and patients in whom long-term 
      follow-up would not be able to be conducted, were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was functional outcome up to 
      6 months post PICU discharge, measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of 
      Disabilities Inventory Computer Adaptive Test. Secondary outcomes included 
      predictors of unfavorable functional outcome, caregiver stress, health-related 
      quality-of-life, and clinical outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, and 
      PICU-acquired complications. One hundred eighty-two patients were enrolled; 78 
      children (43.6%) had functional limitations at baseline and 143 (81.5%) 
      experienced functional deterioration following critical illness. Ninety-two 
      (67.1%) demonstrated some functional recovery by 6 months. Higher baseline 
      function and a neurologic insult at PICU admission were the most significant 
      predictors of functional deterioration. Higher baseline function and increasing 
      age were associated with slower functional recovery. Different factors affect the 
      domains of functioning differently. Preexisting comorbidities and iatrogenic 
      PICU-acquired morbidities were associated with persistent requirement for 
      caregiver support (responsibility function) at 6 months. The degree of functional 
      deterioration after critical illness was a significant predictor of increased 
      hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new information 
      regarding functional outcomes and the factors that influence meaningful aspects 
      of functioning in critically ill children. Identifying patients at greatest risk 
      and modifiable targets for improvement in PICU care guides us in developing 
      strategies to improve functional outcomes and tailor to the rehabilitation needs 
      of these patients and their families.

TI  - Antidepressants in paediatric depression: do not look back in anger but around in 
      awareness.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1192/bjb.2017.2 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we summarise and critique a network meta-analysis (NMA) of 
      antidepressant efficacy and tolerability for paediatric depression and an 
      accompanying editorial. Although we agree that many of the extant studies are 
      flawed, this meta-analysis showed clear efficacy of fluoxetine in the NMA, and 
      for sertraline and escitalopram in pairwise analyses. Consequently, these papers 
      underestimate the benefits of antidepressants for paediatric depression, and 
      provide support for current practice guideline, which recommends the use of an 
      antidepressant if the patient does not respond to psychotherapy. In these 
      circumstances, fluoxetine should be the first choice, with escitalopram and 
      sertraline as alternatives. Declaration of interest D.A.B. receives royalties

TI  - Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Scores Are Responsive to 
      Early Changes in Patient Outcomes Following Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Patient 
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer-adaptive 
      testing (CAT) physical function and pain interference scores can detect early 
      variations in postoperative outcomes following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy 
      and to determine whether age, sex, body mass index, mechanical symptoms, duration 
      of symptoms, and the severity of chondrosis affect these scores. METHODS: 
      Seventy-five patients who had undergone a partial meniscectomy between September 
      2015 and March 2016 and had both preoperative and postoperative PROMIS-CAT data 
      for physical function, pain interference, and depression were included. 
      Demographic, clinical, and surgical data including the presence of intraoperative 
      chondral lesions were collected for statistical analysis to assess for factors 
      that led to differences in PROMIS-CAT outcomes. RESULTS: Preoperatively, patients 
      had decreased physical function and increased pain interference in excess of 1 
      standard deviation from the general population with mean PROMIS scores of 38.5 
      and 63.5, respectively. At the 6-week postoperative visit, patients had 
      significant improvements in both physical function and pain interference with 
      mean scores of 43.4 (P < .001, SE = 0.75) and 55.5 (P < .001, SE = 0.83). Female 
      patients had less improvement in PROMIS physical function (P = .03) and 
      depression (P = .02) scores postoperatively compared with male patients. Patients 
      with high-grade articular cartilage lesions had less improvement in physical 
      function (P = .014) and pain interference (P = .010) at 6 weeks postoperative 
      compared with patients with low grade or no chondral lesion. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PROMIS-CAT provides responsive outcome measures to early postoperative changes in 
      physical function and pain following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and has 
      prognostic value in patient outcomes 6 weeks after procedure. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Level IV case series.

TI  - Construct validity of functional status scores of patients with lymphedema.
PG  - 160-173
AB  - During treatment of lymphedema, routine use of patient-reported outcomes measures 
      (PROMs) is recommended to monitor patient progress; however, the validity 
      functional status (FS) PROMs in these patients is unknown. Our aims were to 
      examine construct validity of the shoulder computerized adaptive testing (CAT) 
      and the foot-and-ankle CAT, as a measure of FS for patients selecting the 
      shoulder or the foot-and-ankle as their main body part affected by their 
      lymphedema. We assessed the ability of the FS scores to distinguish between 
      patient groups in clinically expected ways at admission and discharge from 
      physical therapy. At admission (n=1600), patients who were younger and had more 
      acute symptoms, less severe lymphedema, less co-morbidities, no relevant surgical 
      history, did not use medications for chronic conditions, and exercised regularly, 
      had higher FS. At discharge (n=611), patients who were younger and had less 
      advanced lymphedema, fewer co-morbidities, no relevant surgical history, did not 
      use medications for chronic conditions, exercised regularly, and had more acute 
      symptoms had higher FS change, after controlling for their baseline FS score. Low 
      participation rates in FS outcomes data collection could have biased results. 
      Overall, the CAT-based FS PROMs used in this study discriminated between patient 
      groups in clinically logical ways both at intake and at discharge from lymphedema 
      treatment.

TI  - The clinical utility and construct validity of the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery 
      (NIHTB-CB) in individuals with disabilities.
PG  - 409-412
LID - 10.1037/rep0000201 [doi]
AB  - A State-of-the-Science conference on measurement with disability populations 
      recommended "...the development of cognitive and psychosocial outcome measures, 
      using computer-adaptive testing...that are low in respondent burden and valid 
      across patient populations," (Clohan et al., 2007, p. 1537). Following this 
      recommendation, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and 
      Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) prioritized the development of measures of 
      cognitive functioning for individuals with disabilities, noting that measures of 
      cognitive functioning "have not been developed for systemic application in the 
      field of medical rehabilitation. Cognition is both a rehabilitation outcome and a 
      factor related to broader functional and community outcomes for individuals with 
      a wide variety of disabling conditions" (Office of Special Education & 
      Rehabilitation Services, 2009, p. 37193). From this came the NIH Toolbox for the 
      Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function project (NIH Toolbox) which 
      provides a comprehensive set of cognitive, motor, sensory, and emotional health 
      and function measures for use in clinical, longitudinal, and epidemiological 
      research. The nine papers comprising this special section of Rehabilitation 
      Psychology reflect the sustained collaborative efforts of more than two dozen 
      investigators working at six sites over the past 8 years. They are an initial 
      attempt to validate the NIHTB-CB in disability samples, and they provide initial 
      evidence that the NIHTB-CB can be used with individuals who have TBI, SCI, or 
      stroke. The articles published here reflect the fulfillment of recommendations 
      made during a state-of-the-science conference in 2007. (PsycINFO Database Record

PG  - 6379-6387
LID - 10.1167/iovs.16-20950 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) quality-of-life (QoL) 
      item banks and determine the utility of the final calibrated item banks by 
      simulating a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) application. METHODS: In this 
      clinical, cross-sectional study, 514 participants with DR/DME (mean age +/- SD, 
      60.4 +/- 12.6 years; 64% male) answered 314 items grouped under nine QoL item 
      pools: Visual Symptoms (SY); Ocular Comfort Symptoms (OS); Activity Limitation 
      (AL); Mobility (MB); Emotional (EM); Health Concerns (HC); Social (SC); 
      Convenience (CV); and Economic (EC). The psychometric properties of the item 
      pools were assessed using Rasch analysis, and CAT simulations determined the 
      average number of items administered at high and moderate precision levels. 
      RESULTS: The SY, MB, EM, and HC item pools required minor amendments, mainly 
      involving removal of six poorly worded, highly misfitting items. AL and CV 
      required substantial modification to resolve multidimensionality, which resulted 
      in two new item banks: Driving (DV) and Lighting (LT). Due to unresolvable 
      psychometric issues, the OS, SC, and EC item pools were not pursued further. This 
      iterative process resulted in eight operational item banks that underwent CAT 
      simulations. Correlations between CAT and the full item banks were high (range, 
      0.88-0.99). On average, only 3.6 and 7.2 items were required to gain measurement 
      at moderate and high precision, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our eight 
      psychometrically robust and efficient DR/DME item banks will enable researchers 
      and clinicians to accurately assess the impact and effectiveness of treatment 
      therapies for DR/DME in all areas of QoL.

PG  - 767-744
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement instruments that are used for monitoring patients in 
      mental health care are developed according to the principles of classical test 
      theory. Because the assumptions underlying this theory are outdated, this is a 
      good time to work towards a new method of measurement known as computerised 
      adaptive testing (CAT), the method being based on item response theory. AIM: To 
      introduce the CAT-methodology into Dutch mental health care, and provide an 
      overview of the current and desirable developments. METHOD: We explain what CAT 
      is and why mental health care should warmly welcome this new development. We also 
      outline the limitations of CAT, summarise the developments that have already been 
      made nationally and internationally and consider some developments we think are 
      desirable. RESULTS: PROMIS item banks for anxiety and depression for adults show 
      that CAT is more efficient than instruments currently in use and is able to 
      produce very precise outcomes. CONCLUSION: The first CATs for anxiety and 
      depression will be available late 2017 or early 2018 for adults receiving mental 
      health care in the Netherlands. Recent results are very impressive and 
      CAT-technology will increase the efficiency of symptom measurements, bringing 
      these measurements to a higher level.

AB  - We used the Dutch-Flemish version of the USA PROMIS adult V1.0 item bank for 
      Anxiety as input for developing a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure the 
      entire latent anxiety continuum. First, psychometric analysis of a combined 
      clinical and general population sample (N = 2,010) showed that the 29-item bank 
      has psychometric properties that are required for a CAT administration. Second, a 
      post hoc CAT simulation showed efficient and highly precise measurement, with an 
      average number of 8.64 items for the clinical sample, and 9.48 items for the 
      general population sample. Furthermore, the accuracy of our CAT version was 
      highly similar to that of the full item bank administration, both in final score 
      estimates and in distinguishing clinical subjects from persons without a mental 
      health disorder. We discuss the future directions and limitations of CAT 
      development with the Dutch-Flemish version of the PROMIS Anxiety item bank.

TI  - The Maryland Orthopaedic Registry (MOR): Design and baseline characteristics of a 
      prospective registry.
PG  - 301-307

AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization of patient-reported outcome tools allows a more accurate 
      assessment of the efficacy of treatment, which is critical to comparative 
      effectiveness research. OBJECTIVES: The Maryland Orthopaedic Registry (MOR) was 
      established to assess post-surgical outcomes related to patients' pain, 
      functional status, met expectations, and satisfaction using an electronic data 
      collection system. Secondary aims of the registry include assessment of patient 
      expectations of treatment, activity level, and general health status. METHODS: 
      Adult patients enrolled in this prospective observational study completed 
      self-report measures assessing pre-operative pain, function, treatment 
      expectations, and activity levels during the perioperative period. MOR utilizes 
      the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R)))'computer 
      adaptive testing for physical function, pain interference, fatigue, social 
      satisfaction, anxiety, and depression. Perioperative data is extracted from the 
      medical record. RESULTS: 300 patients (40% of eligible) have been enrolled into 
      the initial cohort. Most patients (94.1%) were aged 18-65, and 57% were male. 
      Fifty-seven percent of enrollees were White, 33% Black, and 4% Asian. PROMIS 
      physical function and social satisfaction were both more than half a standard 
      deviation below the population mean. Participants reported PROMIS anxiety scores 
      that were half a standard deviation above the population mean and pain 
      interference scores that were more than a standard deviation above the mean. 
      Physical function scores were significantly worse among participants with lower 
      extremity orthopaedic issues, but scores on other measures were similar between 
      participants undergoing lower or upper extremity surgery. CONCLUSIONS: MOR 
      provides a comprehensive assessment of patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. 
      The utilization of electronic clinical assessment tools as well as computer 
      adaptive testing allows for time-efficient data collection. The diverse 
      population is a particular strength of MOR.

AB  - PURPOSE: The relationship between psychosocial factors and self-reported physical 
      function among hand and upper extremity patients is complex. The Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) platform has attempted to create 
      a variety of specifically targeted metrics that can be administered using 
      computer adaptive testing (CAT). Three metrics measuring self-reported physical 
      function (herein referred to in combination as "functional" metrics) include the 
      PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT, PROMIS Upper Extremity (UE) CAT, and the Quick 
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH). Two metrics assessing 
      psychosocial factors include the PROMIS Anxiety and Pain Interference (PI) CATs 
      ("nonfunctional" metrics). This study evaluates whether the functional metrics 
      were correlated with nonfunctional metrics. METHODS: The 5 questionnaires were 
      administered prospectively on a tablet computer to all consecutive adult patients 
      presenting to an outpatient hand and upper extremity (nonshoulder) clinic at a 
      tertiary academic medical center from January 1 to November 1, 2014. For patients 
      with multiple visits during the study period, only the first was included. Data 
      were evaluated retrospectively to assess the relationship between functional and 
      nonfunctional measures, with Pearson correlation coefficients to understand the 
      relationship between continuous variables, and 1-way analysis of variance to 
      examine for differences in outcome measures across demographic groups. 
      Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine factors 
      predicting functional disability. RESULTS: We included 1,299 patients: mean age 
      was 46.8 years, 53% were female, and 23% were unemployed or on disability. The 
      PROMIS PF CAT, PROMIS UE CAT, and QuickDASH scores were all significantly 
      correlated with PROMIS Anxiety CAT (Pearson correlation coefficients, -0.46, 
      -0.48, and 0.53, respectively) and PROMIS PI CAT (-0.60, -0.65, and 0.76, 
      respectively) scores. Multivariable regression analyses demonstrated that 
      increased PROMIS Anxiety and PI CAT scores each independently and adversely 
      influenced PROMIS PF CAT, PROMIS UE CAT, and QuickDASH scores. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Increasing levels of patient anxiety and pain interference are independently 
      associated with decreased patient-reported upper extremity function. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: This study provides further support of the biopsychosocial model by 
      highlighting that increased anxiety is associated with decreased self-reported 
      function using the PROMIS platform.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2009, the Army Pain Management Task Force was chartered. On the 
      basis of their findings, the Department of Defense recommended a comprehensive 
      pain management strategy that included development of a standardized pain 
      assessment system that would collect patient-reported outcomes data to inform the 
      patient-provider clinical encounter. The result was the Pain Assessment Screening 
      Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR). The purpose of this study was to assess the 
      validity and response burden of the patient-reported outcome measures in PASTOR. 
      METHODS: Data for analyses were collected from 681 individuals who completed 
      PASTOR at baseline and follow-up as part of their routine clinical care. The 
      survey tool included self-report measures of pain severity and pain interference 
      (measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcome 
      Measurement Information System [PROMIS] and the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating 
      scale). PROMIS measures of pain correlates also were administered. Validation 
      analyses included estimation of score associations among measures, comparison of 
      scores of known groups, responsiveness, ceiling and floor effects, and response 
      burden. RESULTS: Results of psychometric testing provided substantial evidence 
      for the validity of PASTOR self-report measures in this population. Expected 
      associations among scores largely supported the concurrent validity of the 
      measures. Scores effectively distinguished among respondents on the basis of 
      their self-reported impressions of general health. PROMIS measures were 
      administered using computer adaptive testing and each, on average, required less 
      than 1 minute to administer. Statistical and graphical analyses demonstrated the 
      responsiveness of PASTOR measures over time.

AB  - CONTEXT: Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients 
      with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to 
      lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are 
      easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or 
      static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, 
      are designed to fill this void. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the comparability 
      of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. METHODS: Patients (ages 7-22 years) 
      were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome 
      Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper 
      Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson 
      correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the 
      relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference 
      between these two scores, respectively. RESULTS: Data from 161 patients with 
      brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores 
      obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95-0.98). 
      Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains 
      yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across 
      patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest 
      association at the worst or best symptom scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the 
      agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a 
      result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable 
      individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.

AB  - The potential impact of brain training methods for enhancing human cognition in 
      healthy and clinical populations has motivated increasing public interest and 
      scientific scrutiny. At issue is the merits of intervention modalities, such as 
      computer-based cognitive training, physical exercise training, and non-invasive 
      brain stimulation, and whether such interventions synergistically enhance 
      cognition. To investigate this issue, we conducted a comprehensive 4-month 
      randomized controlled trial in which 318 healthy, young adults were enrolled in 
      one of five interventions: (1) Computer-based cognitive training on six adaptive 
      tests of executive function; (2) Cognitive and physical exercise training; (3) 
      Cognitive training combined with non-invasive brain stimulation and physical 
      exercise training; (4) Active control training in adaptive visual search and 
      change detection tasks; and (5) Passive control. Our findings demonstrate that 
      multimodal training significantly enhanced learning (relative to computer-based 
      cognitive training alone) and provided an effective method to promote skill 
      learning across multiple cognitive domains, spanning executive functions, working 
      memory, and planning and problem solving. These results help to establish the 
      beneficial effects of multimodal intervention and identify key areas for future 
      research in the continued effort to improve human cognition.

TI  - Performance of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      Upper Extremity (UE) Versus Physical Function (PF) Computer Adaptive Tests (CATs) 
      in Upper Extremity Clinics.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the performance of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity (UE) Function Computer Adaptive Test 
      (CAT) relative to the PROMIS Physical Function (PF) CAT in patients seeking 
      specialty care for upper extremity conditions. METHODS: This observational trial 
      analyzed prospectively collected PROMIS UE and PF CAT scores from 5,202 adult 
      patients with 10,344 outpatient clinic visits presenting to a tertiary orthopedic 
      clinic. Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the association 
      between initial PF and UE scores as well as the association between changes in PF 
      and UE scores between visits. Differences in scores between populations 
      presenting with hand conditions versus shoulder and elbow conditions were 
      evaluated via Student t test, as were differences in scores between new and 
      return patient visits. RESULTS: The PROMIS UE CAT scores were strongly correlated 
      with PROMIS PF CAT scores. However, patients averaged 8 points lower scoring on 
      UE CAT testing than on PF CAT scores. The UE CAT demonstrated a ceiling effect at 
      a score of 56 that affected 7% of patients with a secondary ceiling at 50. 
      Changes in PF and UE scores between visits were moderately correlated with a mean 
      difference of less than 1 point. Patients presenting for hand conditions achieved 
      better PF and UE scores than patients presenting for shoulder and elbow 
      conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS UE module appears responsive to changes over 
      time. However, the current UE CAT has a ceiling score of 56, which does not allow 
      for improvement of scores 0.6 SD higher than the presumptive normative population 
      mean of 50. Although a specific assessment of upper extremity function is 
      desirable, continued refinement of the PROMIS UE CAT is required to better assess 
      patients with higher levels of function. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Diagnostic II.

AB  - We developed a Dutch-Flemish version of the patient-reported outcomes measurement 
      information system (PROMIS) adult V1.0 item bank for depression as input for 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT). As item bank, we used the Dutch-Flemish 
      translation of the original PROMIS item bank (28 items) and additionally 
      translated 28 U.S. depression items that failed to make the final U.S. item bank. 
      Through psychometric analysis of a combined clinical and general population 
      sample ( N = 2,010), 8 added items were removed. With the final item bank, we 
      performed several CAT simulations to assess the efficiency of the extended (48 
      items) and the original item bank (28 items), using various stopping rules. Both 
      item banks resulted in highly efficient and precise measurement of depression and 
      showed high similarity between the CAT simulation scores and the full item bank 
      scores. We discuss the implications of using each item bank and stopping rule for 
      further CAT development.

TI  - Measuring working memory capacity in children using adaptive tasks: Example 
      validation of an adaptive complex span.
PG  - 910-921
LID - 10.3758/s13428-017-0916-4 [doi]
AB  - Working memory tasks designed for children usually present trials in order of 
      ascending difficulty, with testing discontinued when the child fails a particular 
      level. Unfortunately, this procedure comes with a number of issues, such as 
      decreased engagement from high-ability children, vulnerability of the scores to 
      temporary mind-wandering, and large between-subjects variations in number of 
      trials, testing time, and proactive interference. To circumvent these problems, 
      the goal of the present study was to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing 
      working memory using an adaptive testing procedure. The principle of adaptive 
      testing is to dynamically adjust the level of difficulty as the task progresses 
      to match the participant's ability. We used this method to develop an adaptive 
      complex span task (the ACCES) comprising verbal and visuo-spatial subtests. The 
      task presents a fixed number of trials to all participants, allows for partial 
      credit scoring, and can be used with children regardless of ability level. The 
      ACCES demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in a sample of 268 children 
      aged 8-13 years, confirming the feasibility of using adaptive tasks to measure 
      working memory capacity in children. A free-to-use implementation of the ACCES is 
      provided.

LID - 12
AB  - Computer adaptive testing (CAT) is a kind of tailored testing, in that it is a 
      form of computer-based testing that is adaptive to each test-taker's ability 
      level. In this review, the impacts of CAT are discussed from different 
      perspectives in order to illustrate crucial points to keep in mind during the 
      development and implementation of CAT. Test developers and psychometricians often 
      emphasize the efficiency and accuracy of CAT in comparison to traditional linear 
      tests. However, many test-takers report feeling discouraged after taking CATs, 
      and this feeling can reduce learning self-efficacy and motivation. A trade-off 
      must be made between the psychological experiences of test-takers and measurement 
      efficiency. From the perspective of educators and subject matter experts, 
      nonstatistical specifications, such as content coverage, content balance, and 
      form length are major concerns. Thus, accreditation bodies may be faced with a 
      discrepancy between the perspectives of psychometricians and those of subject 
      matter experts. In order to improve test-takers' impressions of CAT, the author 
      proposes increasing the target probability of answering correctly in the item 
      selection algorithm even if doing so consequently decreases measurement 
      efficiency. Two different methods, CAT with a shadow test approach and 
      computerized multistage testing, have been developed in order to ensure the 
      satisfaction of subject matter experts. In the shadow test approach, a 
      full-length test is assembled that meets the constraints and provides maximum 
      information at the current ability estimate, while computerized multistage 
      testing gives subject matter experts an opportunity to review all test forms 
      prior to administration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current suicide risk screening and measurement are inefficient, have 
      limited measurement precision, and focus entirely on suicide-related items. For 
      this study, a psychometric harmonization between related suicide, depression, and 
      anxiety symptom domains that provides a more balanced and complete spectrum of 
      suicidal symptomatology was developed. The objective of this article is to 
      describe the results of the early stages of computerized adaptive testing 
      development for a suicide scale and pave the way for the final stage of 
      validation. METHODS: Data from psychiatric outpatients at the University of 
      Pittsburgh and a community health clinic were collected from January 2010 through 
      June 2012. 789 participants were enrolled in the calibration phase; 70% were 
      female, and 30% were male. The rate of major depressive disorder as diagnosed by 
      DSM-5 was 47%. The item bank contained 1,008 items related to depression, 
      anxiety, and mania, including 11 suicide items. Data were analyzed using a 
      bifactor model to identify a core dimension between suicidal ideation, 
      depression, anxiety, and mania items. A computerized adaptive test was developed 
      via simulation from the actual complete item responses in 308 subjects. RESULTS: 
      111 items were identified that provided an extension of suicidality assessment to 
      include statistically related responses from depression and anxiety domains that 
      are syndromally associated with suicidality. All items had high loadings on the 
      primary suicide dimension (average = 0.67; range, 0.49-0.88). Analyses revealed 
      that a mean of 10 items (5-20) had a correlation of 0.96 with the 111-item scale, 
      with a precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale metric. Preliminary validation 
      data based on 290 clinician interviews revealed a 52-fold increase in the 
      likelihood of current suicidal ideation across the range of the Computerized 
      Adaptive Test Suicide Scale (CAT-SS). CONCLUSIONS: The CAT-SS is able to 
      accurately measure the latent suicide dimension with a mean of 10 items in 
      approximately 2 minutes. Further validation against an independent 
      clinician-administered assessment of suicide risk (ideation and attempts) and 
      prediction of suicidal behavior is underway.

TI  - Improving Assessment of Work Related Mental Health Function Using the Work 
      Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB).
PG  - 190-199
LID - 10.1007/s10926-017-9710-5 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional 
      Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security 
      Administration's (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal 
      was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood & emotions, resilience, social 
      interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the 
      current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition & 
      communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified 
      sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a 
      general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were 
      developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and 
      item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We 
      conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric 
      properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental 
      health subdomains: Cognition & Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 
      items), Resilience & Sociability (29 items) and Mood & Emotions (34 items). All 
      scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were 
      effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB 
      has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context 
      of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational 
      rehabilitation settings.

TI  - Developing and Validating a Computerized Adaptive Test to Measure Broad and 
      Specific Factors of Internalizing in a Community Sample.
PG  - 1030-1045
LID - 10.1177/1073191117707817 [doi]
AB  - Highly efficient assessments that better account for comorbidity between mood and 
      anxiety disorders (internalizing) are required to identify individuals who are 
      most at risk of psychopathology in the community. The current study examined the 
      efficiency and validity associated with a multidimensional computerized adaptive 
      test (CAT) to measure broad and specific levels of internalizing psychopathology. 
      The sample comprised 3,175 respondents to an online survey. Items from five banks 
      (generalized anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, 
      social anxiety disorder) were jointly calibrated using a bifactor item response 
      theory model. Simulations indicated that an adaptive algorithm could accurately 
      (rs >/= 0.90) estimate general internalizing and specific disorder scores using on 
      average 44 items in comparison with the full 133-item bank (67% reduction in 
      items). Scores on the CAT demonstrate convergent and divergent validity with 
      previously validated short severity scales and could significantly differentiate 
      cases of DSM-5 disorder. As such, the CAT validly measures both broad and 
      specific constructs of internalizing disorders in a manner similar to the full 
      item bank and a static brief form but with greater gains in efficiency and, 
      therefore, a reduced degree of respondent burden.

TI  - Advancing the efficiency and efficacy of patient reported outcomes with 
      multivariate computer adaptive testing.
PG  - 897-902
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocx003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      initiative developed an array of patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. To 
      reduce the number of questions administered, PROMIS utilizes unidimensional item 
      response theory and unidimensional computer adaptive testing (UCAT), which means 
      a separate set of questions is administered for each measured trait. 
      Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) and multidimensional computer 
      adaptive testing (MCAT) simultaneously assess correlated traits. The objective 
      was to investigate the extent to which MCAT reduces patient burden relative to 
      UCAT in the case of PROs. METHODS: One MIRT and 3 unidimensional item response 
      theory models were developed using the related traits anxiety, depression, and 
      anger. Using these models, MCAT and UCAT performance was compared with simulated 
      individuals. RESULTS: Surprisingly, the root mean squared error for both methods 
      increased with the number of items. These results were driven by large errors for 
      individuals with low trait levels. A second analysis focused on individuals 
      aligned with item content. For these individuals, both MCAT and UCAT accuracies 
      improved with additional items. Furthermore, MCAT reduced the test length by 50%. 
      DISCUSSION: For the PROMIS Emotional Distress banks, neither UCAT nor MCAT 
      provided accurate estimates for individuals at low trait levels. Because the 
      items in these banks were designed to detect clinical levels of distress, there 
      is little information for individuals with low trait values. However, trait 
      estimates for individuals targeted by the banks were accurate and MCAT asked 
      substantially fewer questions. CONCLUSION: By reducing the number of items 
      administered, MCAT can allow clinicians and researchers to assess a wider range 
      of PROs with less patient burden.

TI  - The development and validation of static and adaptive screeners to measure the 
      severity of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive 
      disorder.
LID - 10.1002/mpr.1561 [doi]

AB  - A series of static and adaptive screeners for panic disorder, social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were developed and 
      compared using data-driven methods to facilitate the measurement of each disorder 
      in community samples. Data comprised 3175 respondents for the development sample 
      and 3755 respondents for the validation sample, recruited independently using 
      Facebook advertising. Item Response Theory (IRT) was utilized to develop static 
      continuous screeners and to simulate computerized adaptive algorithms. The 
      screeners consisted of a small subset of items from each bank (79% reduction in 
      items for panic disorder, 85% reduction in items for SAD, and 84% reduction in 
      items for OCD) that provided similar scores (r = 0.88-0.96). Both static and 
      adaptive screeners were valid with respect to existing scales that purportedly 
      measure similar constructs (r > 0.70 for panic disorder, r > 0.76 for SAD, and 
      r > 0.68 for OCD). The adaptive scales were able to maintain a higher level of 
      precision in comparison to the static scales and evidenced slightly higher 
      concordance with scores generated by the full item banks. The screeners for panic 
      disorder, SAD, and OCD could be used as a flexible approach to measure and 
      monitor the severity of psychopathology in tailored treatment protocols.

TI  - A self-report measure for the ICD-11 dimensional trait model proposal: The 
      personality inventory for ICD-11.
PG  - 154-169
LID - 10.1037/pas0000459 [doi]
AB  - Proposed for the 11th edition of the World Health Organization's International 
      Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) is a dimensional trait model for the 
      classification of personality disorder (Tyrer, Reed, & Crawford, 2015). The 
      ICD-11 proposal consists of 5 broad domains: negative affective, detachment, 
      dissocial, disinhibition, and anankastic (Mulder, Horwood, Tyrer, Carter, & 
      Joyce, 2016). Several field trials have examined this proposal, yet none has 
      included a direct measure of the trait model. The purpose of the current study 
      was to develop and provide initial validation for the Personality Inventory for 
      ICD-11 (PiCD), a self-report measure of this proposed 5-domain maladaptive trait 
      model. Item selection and scale construction proceeded through 3 initial data 
      collections assessing potential item performance. Two subsequent studies were 
      conducted for scale validation. In Study 1, the PiCD was evaluated in a sample of 
      259 MTurk participants (who were or had been receiving mental health treatment) 
      with respect to 2 measures of general personality structure: The Eysenck 
      Personality Questionnaire-Revised and the 5-Dimensional Personality Test. In 
      Study 2, the PiCD was evaluated in an additional sample of 285 participants with 
      respect to 2 measures of maladaptive personality traits: The Personality 
      Inventory for DSM-5 and the Computerized Adaptive Test for Personality Disorders. 
      Study 3 provides an item-level exploratory structural equation model with the 
      combined samples from Studies 1 and 2. The results are discussed with respect to 
      the validity of the measure and the potential benefits for future research in 
      having a direct, self-report measure of the ICD-11 trait proposal. (PsycINFO

TI  - Applying Computerized Adaptive Testing to the Four-Dimensional Symptom 
      Questionnaire (4DSQ): A Simulation Study.
PG  - e7
LID - 10.2196/mental.6545 [doi]
LID - e7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficient screening questionnaires are useful in general practice. 
      Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a method to improve the efficiency of 
      questionnaires, as only the items that are particularly informative for a certain 
      responder are dynamically selected. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to 
      test whether CAT could improve the efficiency of the Four-Dimensional Symptom 
      Questionnaire (4DSQ), a frequently used self-report questionnaire designed to 
      assess common psychosocial problems in general practice. METHODS: A simulation 
      study was conducted using a sample of Dutch patients visiting a general 
      practitioner (GP) with psychological problems (n=379). Responders completed a 
      paper-and-pencil version of the 50-item 4DSQ and a psychometric evaluation was 
      performed to check if the data agreed with item response theory (IRT) 
      assumptions. Next, a CAT simulation was performed for each of the four 4DSQ 
      scales (distress, depression, anxiety, and somatization), based on the given 
      responses as if they had been collected through CAT. The following two stopping 
      rules were applied for the administration of items: (1) stop if measurement 
      precision is below a predefined level, or (2) stop if more than half of the items 
      of the subscale are administered. RESULTS: In general, the items of each of the 
      four scales agreed with IRT assumptions. Application of the first stopping rule 
      reduced the length of the questionnaire by 38% (from 50 to 31 items on average). 
      When the second stopping rule was also applied, the total number of items could 
      be reduced by 56% (from 50 to 22 items on average). CONCLUSIONS: CAT seems useful 
      for improving the efficiency of the 4DSQ by 56% without losing a considerable 
      amount of measurement precision. The CAT version of the 4DSQ may be useful as 
      part of an online assessment to investigate the severity of mental health 
      problems of patients visiting a GP. This simulation study is the first step 
      needed for the development a CAT version of the 4DSQ. A CAT version of the 4DSQ 
      could be of high value for Dutch GPs since increasing numbers of patients with 
      mental health problems are visiting the general practice. In further research, 
      the results of a real-time CAT should be compared with the results of the 
      administration of the full scale.

PG  - 403-409
LID - 10.1177/1558944715628006 [doi]
AB  - Background: Almost 2 decades have passed since the development of the items 
      contained in the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) 
      questionnaire, and during this time, daily tasks have changed to adapt to changes 
      in technology. Methods: A cohort of 108 patients completed demographic 
      information, the Quick DASH (both standard and technologically updated versions), 
      and 2 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-based 
      computerized adaptive testing questionnaires: PROMIS pain interference and 
      upper-extremity function. To create a technologically updated Quick DASH, we 
      substituted 3 items from the standard Quick DASH questionnaire with 3 other items 
      related to the use of technology: (1) Text or dial with your cell phone, (2) Type 
      on a keyboard, and (3) Use a computer mouse. Results: The technologically updated 
      Quick DASH questionnaire had lower scores compared with the standard Quick DASH 
      (37 vs. 33, respectively), but they had a large correlation and both had high 
      internal consistency. The items "Text or dial with your cell phone" and "Use a 
      computer mouse" in the updated Quick DASH questionnaire had the lowest scores. 
      Except for affected side, the standard Quick DASH and updated Quick DASH were 
      influenced by the same factors. PROMIS pain interference was the only independent 
      variable affecting both questionnaire scores. Conclusions: A technologically 
      updated Quick DASH had no advantage over the standard Quick DASH.

TI  - Developing new online calibration methods for multidimensional computerized 
      adaptive testing.
PG  - 81-117
LID - 10.1111/bmsp.12083 [doi]
AB  - Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has received increasing 
      attention over the past few years in educational measurement. Like all other 
      formats of CAT, item replenishment is an essential part of MCAT for its item bank 
      maintenance and management, which governs retiring overexposed or obsolete items 
      over time and replacing them with new ones. Moreover, calibration precision of 
      the new items will directly affect the estimation accuracy of examinees' ability 
      vectors. In unidimensional CAT (UCAT) and cognitive diagnostic CAT, online 
      calibration techniques have been developed to effectively calibrate new items. 
      However, there has been very little discussion of online calibration in MCAT in 
      the literature. Thus, this paper proposes new online calibration methods for MCAT 
      based upon some popular methods used in UCAT. Three representative methods, 
      Method A, the 'one EM cycle' method and the 'multiple EM cycles' method, are 
      generalized to MCAT. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare the three 
      new methods by manipulating three factors (test length, item bank design, and 
      level of correlation between coordinate dimensions). The results showed that all 
      the new methods were able to recover the item parameters accurately, and the 
      adaptive online calibration designs showed some improvements compared to the 
      random design under most conditions.

AB  - The current study investigated the utility and validity of a computerized 
      "depression" module of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Second 
      version (MMPI-2), with and without sequential testing rules, with a college 
      student sample. Participants completed one of three MMPI-2 test-retest 
      administrations (i.e., conventional-conventional, conventional-module, or 
      conventional-sequential module) as well as 15 criterion measures across two 
      testing sessions exactly 1 week apart. The findings pointed to statistically 
      significant and clinically meaningful time-savings in administering selected 
      MMPI-2 scales (for both full-length and variable-length versions). Criterion 
      measures rationally selected to represent similar (depression, anhedonia, 
      anxiety) and dissimilar (behavioral, thought, and somatic dysfunction) 
      psychological constructs were administered to assess the convergent and 
      discriminant validity of the depression module. The criterion correlations 
      suggested minimal differences in discriminant and convergent validity across 
      administration modes, suggesting limited to no impact of administering targeted 
      MMPI-2 scales in terms of construct validity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess reliability and validity of three single leg standing 
      clinical tests in patients with plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS). DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional reliability study. PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients diagnosed with 
      PHPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients stood on their affected foot in a static 
      stance for up to 30seconds, a half squat for up to 10 repetitions, and a heel 
      rise for up to 10 repetitions. The first sensation of pain (p1) determined the 
      termination of each test, and established a positive test result. The level of p1 
      was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS); time or repetitions for each 
      test were recorded. Prior to performing the tests, all patients completed the 
      Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test to measure functional status (FS). 
      RESULTS: Detection of p1 in each test showed good reliability for inter- and 
      intrarater assessment (Kappa=0.60 to 0.78 and 0.56 to 0.77, respectively). The 
      intraclass correlation coefficient for the VAS measures was 0.85 to 0.95 for 
      inter-rater assessment and 0.78 to 0.92 for intrarater assessment. However, the 
      Bland and Altman limits of agreement were wide, indicating that these measures 
      were less reliable than the correlation coefficients suggested. Thirty-five 
      patients (88%) experienced a positive pain response to at least one test. 
      Significant correlations were found between the VAS measures in each test and FS 
      (r=0.63 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The static stance, half squat and heel rise tests 
      were easily implemented, and found to be reliable and valid according to one 
      analysis, yet less reliable with another, for pain provocation and VAS levels in 
      patients with PHPS. All three VAS levels correlated well with FS.

LID - e0167219
AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk 
      yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can 
      excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and 
      infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety 
      of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent 
      testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern 
      for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to 
      evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting 
      the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. 
      The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene 
      level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of 
      prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the 
      true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was 
      poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of 
      the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the 
      low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look 
      at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing 
      frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of 
      eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should 
      probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest 
      that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an 
      adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when 
      the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling 
      interval of one year.

TI  - First use of patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) 
      measures in adults with neurofibromatosis.
PG  - 413-419

AB  - The patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) provides 
      clinicians and researchers access to reliable, validated measures of physical, 
      mental, and social well-being. The use of PROMIS can facilitate comparisons among 
      clinical subpopulations and with the U.S. general population. We report on the 
      first study using PROMIS measures in patients with neurofibromatosis (NF). 
      Eighty-six adult patients (mean age = 44; 55% female; 87% white; 50% NF1, 41% NF2 
      and 9% schwannomatosis) completed a battery of PROMIS computerized adaptive tests 
      (CATs). Across all PROMIS instruments, mean scores for each CAT were between 
      48.97 and 52.60, which is within +/-0.5 SD of the U.S. general population norms. 
      However, scores were distributed across a broad range for each PROMIS measure (+/-3 
      SDs). Clinically meaningful scores (defined >1 SD impairment) were observed in 
      20% (pain interference), 17% (pain behavior), 16% (physical function), 16% 
      (anxiety), 16% (depression), 15% (satisfaction with social roles), 13% (fatigue), 
      6% (anger), and 5% (satisfaction with discretionary social activities) of the 
      sample. All PROMIS measures were highly interrelated in bivariate analysis 
      (P </= .001). There were no differences in PROMIS scores by disease type (NF1, NF2 
      and schwannomatosis), or self reported learning disabilities, or compared with 
      the US population. Scores suggest a broad continuum of symptoms and functioning 
      in patients with NF that is not affected by NF type, as well as interrelation 
      among the physical and psychosocial domains as measured by PROMIS. PROMIS 
      measures may be useful in clinical practice to monitor changes in symptoms and 
      functioning over time, as well as in clinical trials to determine patient 
      reported changes during drug and psychosocial clinical trials.

TI  - ADAPTIVE TESTING OF SNP-BRAIN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY ASSOCIATION VIA A MODULAR 
      NETWORK ANALYSIS.
PG  - 58-69
AB  - Due to its high dimensionality and high noise levels, analysis of a large brain 
      functional network may not be powerful and easy to interpret; instead, 
      decomposition of a large network into smaller subcomponents called modules may be 
      more promising as suggested by some empirical evidence. For example, alteration 
      of brain modularity is observed in patients suffering from various types of brain 
      malfunctions. Although several methods exist for estimating brain functional 
      networks, such as the sample correlation matrix or graphical lasso for a sparse 
      precision matrix, it is still difficult to extract modules from such network 
      estimates. Motivated by these considerations, we adapt a weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) framework to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) 
      data to identify modular structures in brain functional networks. Modular 
      structures are identified by using topological overlap matrix (TOM) elements in 
      hierarchical clustering. We propose applying a new adaptive test built on the 
      proportional odds model (POM) that can be applied to a high-dimensional setting, 
      where the number of variables (p) can exceed the sample size (n) in addition to 
      the usual p < n setting. We applied our proposed methods to the ADNI data to test 
      for associations between a genetic variant and either the whole brain functional 
      network or its various subcomponents using various connectivity measures. We 
      uncovered several modules based on the control cohort, and some of them were 
      marginally associated with the APOE4 variant and several other SNPs; however, due 
      to the small sample size of the ADNI data, larger studies are needed.

TI  - Efficiently measuring dimensions of the externalizing spectrum model: Development 
      of the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory-Computerized Adaptive Test (ESI-CAT).
PG  - 868-880
LID - 10.1037/pas0000384 [doi]
AB  - The development of the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory (ESI) was motivated by 
      the need to comprehensively assess the interrelated nature of externalizing 
      psychopathology and personality using an empirically driven framework. The ESI 
      measures 23 theoretically distinct yet related unidimensional facets of 
      externalizing, which are structured under 3 superordinate factors representing 
      general externalizing, callous aggression, and substance abuse. One limitation of 
      the ESI is its length at 415 items. To facilitate the use of the ESI in busy 
      clinical and research settings, the current study sought to examine the 
      efficiency and accuracy of a computerized adaptive version of the ESI. Data were 
      collected over 3 waves and totaled 1,787 participants recruited from 
      undergraduate psychology courses as well as male and female state prisons. A 
      series of 6 algorithms with different termination rules were simulated to 
      determine the efficiency and accuracy of each test under 3 different assumed 
      distributions. Scores generated using an optimal adaptive algorithm evidenced 
      high correlations (r > .9) with scores generated using the full ESI, brief ESI 
      item-based factor scales, and the 23 facet scales. The adaptive algorithms for 
      each facet administered a combined average of 115 items, a 72% decrease in 
      comparison to the full ESI. Similarly, scores on the item-based factor scales of 
      the ESI-brief form (57 items) were generated using on average of 17 items, a 70% 
      decrease. The current study successfully demonstrates that an adaptive algorithm 
      can generate similar scores for the ESI and the 3 item-based factor scales using 
      a fraction of the total item pool. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - A computerized adaptive test for enterprising personality assessment in youth.
PG  - 471-478
AB  - Backgound : Assessing specific personality traits has shown better predictive 
      power of enterprising personality than have broad personality traits. Hitherto, 
      there have been no instruments that evaluate the combination of specific 
      personality traits of enterprising personality in an adaptive format. So, the aim 
      was to develop a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) to assess enterprising 
      personality in young people. METHODS: A pool of 161 items was developed and 
      applied to two sets of participants (n 1 = 357 students, M age = 17.89; SD age = 
      3.26; n 2 = 2,693 students; M age = 16.52, SD age = 1.38) using a stratified 
      sampling method. RESULTS: 107 items that assess achievement motivation, 
      risk-taking, innovativeness, autonomy, self-efficacy, stress tolerance, internal 
      locus of control, and optimism were selected. The assumption of unidimensionality 
      was tested. The CAT demonstrated high precision for a wide range of q, using a 
      mean of 10 items and demonstrating a relatively low Standard Error (0.378). 
      CONCLUSIONS: A brief, valid, and precise instrument was obtained with relevant 
      implications for educational and entrepreneurial contexts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) have been proposed to 
      facilitate assessments in mental health. These tests are built in a standard way, 
      disregarding useful and usually available information not included in the 
      assessment scales that could increase the precision and utility of CATs, such as 
      the history of suicide attempts. METHODS: Using the items of a previously 
      developed scale for suicidal risk, we compared the performance of a standard CAT 
      and a decision tree in a support decision system to identify suicidal behavior. 
      We included the history of past suicide attempts as a class for the separation of 
      patients in the decision tree. RESULTS: The decision tree needed an average of 
      four items to achieve a similar accuracy than a standard CAT with nine items. The 
      accuracy of the decision tree, obtained after 25 cross-validations, was 81.4%. A 
      shortened test adapted for the separation of suicidal and non-suicidal patients 
      was developed. CONCLUSION: CATs can be very useful tools for the assessment of 
      suicidal risk. However, standard CATs do not use all the information that is 
      available. A decision tree can improve the precision of the assessment since they 
      are constructed using a priori information.

TI  - The Feasibility and Validity of PROMIS: A Novel Measure of Quality of Life among 
      Children with Cleft Lip and Palate.
PG  - 675e-681e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000002541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life is inconsistently captured among 
      children with cleft lip and palate. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) captures health-related quality of life, with the 
      added benefit of comparability across clinical conditions. In this study, the 
      authors define the validity and feasibility of PROMIS among children with clefts. 
      METHODS: Children with cleft lip and palate who were at least 5 years old and 
      able to complete instruments independently were eligible for inclusion (n = 93). 
      Children completed PROMIS anxiety, depression, and peer relationship item banks 
      as short forms or computerized adaptive tests. Participants also completed the 
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Construct validity was measured by Spearman 
      correlations between PROMIS and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
      controlling for race, sex, age, and income. Feasibility was measured using 
      instrument completion time, reading level, and floor/ceiling effects. RESULTS: 
      PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (peer relationship, r = 0.49; depression, r = 
      -0.56; and anxiety, r = -0.36) and short forms (peer relationship, r = 0.65; 
      depression, r = -0.54; and anxiety, r = -0.56) demonstrated moderate correlation 
      with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Computerized adaptive tests had 
      fewer floor (0 percent versus 0 percent) and ceiling (8.6 to 19.3 percent versus 
      21.8 to 41.9 percent) effects than short forms, and demonstrated better 
      readability. Computerized adaptive tests required more time than short forms 
      (peer relationship, 0.84 +/- 0.67 versus 1.3 +/- 0.92; depression, 0.52 +/- 0.38 versus 
      1.1 +/- 0.73; and anxiety, 0.53 +/- 0.23 versus 1.1 +/- 0.62; p = 0.001), as each 
      computerized adaptive test included on average four more questions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PROMIS correlates well with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and 
      demonstrates similar accuracy, with better readability and efficiency. Use of 
      PROMIS will improve our ability to compare children with cleft lip and palate to 
      diverse populations and clinical conditions. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Diagnostic, II.

TI  - Examining the Construct Validity of the MMPI-2-RF Interpersonal Functioning 
      Scales Using the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder as a 
      Comparative Framework.
PG  - 416-423
LID - 10.1080/00223891.2016.1222394 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to examine the construct validity of the Minnesota Multiphasic 
      Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) interpersonal functioning 
      scales (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011 ) using as a criterion measure the 
      Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms 
      et al., 2011 ). Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the 
      university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each 
      of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as 
      predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 
      specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial (>/= |.30|) correlations. 
      The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations 
      with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly 
      correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was 
      most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was 
      most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was 
      most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and 
      Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and 
      Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for 
      both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research 
      designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) 
      is suggested.

      What Are the Sources of Their Resistance?

LID - S0003-9993(16)30905-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.apmr.2016.08.459 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the proportion and characteristics of patients with late 
      stage cancer that are and are not receptive to receiving rehabilitation services, 
      and the rationale for their level of interest. DESIGN: Prospective mixed-methods 
      study. SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center in a quaternary medical center. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Adults with stage IIIC or IV non-small cell or extensive stage 
      small cell lung cancer (N=311). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Telephone-acquired responses to the administration of (1) the Activity 
      Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM-PAC-CAT); (2) numerical 
      rating scales for pain, dyspnea, fatigue, general emotional distress, and 
      distress associated with functional limitations; (3) a query regarding 
      receptivity to receipt of rehabilitation services, and (4) a query about 
      rationale for nonreceptivity. RESULTS: Overall, 99 (31.8%) of the study's 311 
      participants expressed interest in receiving rehabilitation services: 38 at the 
      time of enrollment and an additional 61 during at least 1 subsequent contact. 
      Participants expressing interest were more likely to have a child as primary 
      caregiver (18.18% vs 9.91%, P=.04) and a musculoskeletal comorbidity (42.4% vs 
      31.6%, P=.05). Function-related distress was highly associated with receptivity, 
      as were lower AM-PAC-CAT scores. Reasons provided for lack of interest in 
      receiving services included a perception of their limited benefit, being too 
      busy, and prioritization below more pressing tasks/concerns. CONCLUSIONS: 
      One-third of patients with late stage lung cancer are likely to be interested in 
      receiving rehabilitation services despite high levels of disability and related 
      distress. These findings suggest that patient misperception of the role of 
      rehabilitation services may be a barrier to improved function and quality of 
      life. Efforts to educate patients on the benefits of rehabilitation and to more 
      formally integrate rehabilitation as part of comprehensive care may curb these 
      missed opportunities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The computer adaptive test ACAT-cardio has been developed in order to 
      screen cardiovascular rehabilitation patients for anxiety. This study aims at 
      investigating the criterion validity, and identifying appropriate cut-off values 
      for its use in cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: 106 cardiovascular rehabilitation 
      patients were tested for anxiety disorders using the instruments ACAT-cardio and 
      SKID-I. Receiver operating characteristics were employed to analyse the results 
      of 3 stopping rules of the ACAT-cardio. RESULTS: ROC analyses for the stopping 
      rules yielded areas under the curve (AUC) between 0.80 and 0.84. The ideal 
      cut-off values of the ACAT-cardio (theta scores) were - 0.20 (sensitivity: 
      86%),-0.23 (sensitivity: 71%) and - 0.35 (sensitivity: 86%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ACAT-cardio has proven to be a valid instrument that can be used for screening 
      anxiety disorders in cardiac rehabilitation.

TI  - The Prodromal Questionnaire: a case for IRT-based adaptive testing of psychotic 
      experiences?
LID - 10.1002/mpr.1518 [doi]
LID - e1518
AB  - Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for positive and negative psychotic 
      experiences were developed and tested in N = 5705 help-seeking, non-psychotic 
      young individuals. Instead of presenting all items, CATs choose a varying number 
      of different items during test administration depending on respondents' previous 
      answers, reducing the average number of items while still obtaining accurate 
      person estimates. We assessed the appropriateness of two-parameter logistic 
      models to positive and negative symptoms of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ), 
      computed measurement precision of all items and resulting adaptive tests along 
      psychotic dimensions by Real Data Simulations (RDS), and computed indices for 
      criterion and predictive validities of the CATs. For all items, mean absolute 
      differences between observed and expected response probabilities were smaller 
      than 0.02. CAT-POS predicted transition to psychosis and duration of 
      hospitalization in individuals at-risk for psychosis, and CAT-NEG was 
      suggestively related to later functioning. Regarding psychosis risk 
      classifications of help-seeking individuals, CAT-POS performed less than the 
      PQ-16. Adaptive testing based on self-reported positive and negative symptoms in 
      individuals at-risk for psychosis is a feasible method to select patients for 
      further risk classification. These promising findings need to be replicated 
      prospectively in a non-selective sample that also includes non-at-risk 
      individuals. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Acupuncture-Related Quality of Life Changes Using PROMIS Computer Adaptive Tests 
      in a Pragmatic Trial with Oncology and General Integrative Medicine Patients: The 
      Role of Baseline Acupuncture Expectations.
PG  - 778-787
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acupuncture has been shown to alleviate symptoms and increase 
      general well-being in different medical patient samples. A major challenge in 
      acupuncture clinical research is the availability of comparable and standardized 
      patient-reported outcome measurement (PRO) tools. OBJECTIVES: This study used a 
      pragmatic design to examine longitudinal changes in quality of life (QOL) in a 
      medical patient sample following acupuncture using PROs from the National 
      Institutes of Health's Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) initiative. It also examined the role of acupuncture expectancies, as 
      well as patient and provider perceptions of acupuncture benefit. DESIGN: 
      Following informed consent, patients completed baseline QOL measures (T1) prior 
      to their first acupuncture session. Subsequent assessments (up to 20) were 
      completed immediately following ensuing acupuncture sessions. Patients completed 
      assessments either on a touch-screen computer at the clinic or from their home 
      computer. RESULTS: Compared with acupuncture-naive participants, those who 
      received prior acupuncture treatment reported significantly higher anxiety, 
      fatigue, sleep disturbance, and lower positive affect at baseline. By the second 
      assessment, however, these differences became nonexistent. Participants who held 
      greater baseline acupuncture expectations (e.g., their situation would improve a 
      lot, they would have improved coping skills, their symptoms would disappear, 
      their energy would increase) reported significantly higher fatigue, pain 
      interference, and problems with physical functioning. Between T1 and T2, all 
      participants reported significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and 
      fatigue. Exploratory longitudinal models demonstrated significant linear 
      improvements over time in anxiety (p = 0.006), depression (p = 0.007), pain 
      interference (p < 0.001), and sleep disturbance (p = 0.004). No linear reduction 
      over time was found with fatigue (p = 0.587), physical function (p = 0.654), or 
      positive affect (p = 0.247). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, PROMIS computer adaptive tests 
      were able to assess domains of QOL briefly. Although pretreatment acupuncture 
      expectations highlighted subgroup differences in outcomes at baseline, 
      linear-growth models demonstrated the positive effects of acupuncture over time 
      on anxiety, depression, pain interference, and sleep disturbance.

TI  - The COPD-SIB: a newly developed disease-specific item bank to measure 
      health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is widely used as an outcome 
      measure in the evaluation of treatment interventions in patients with chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In order to address challenges associated 
      with existing fixed-length measures (e.g., too long to be used routinely, too 
      short to ensure both content validity and reliability), a COPD-specific item bank 
      (COPD-SIB) was developed. METHODS: Items were selected based on literature review 
      and interviews with Dutch COPD patients, with a strong focus on both content 
      validity and item comprehension. The psychometric quality of the item bank was 
      evaluated using Mokken Scale Analysis and parametric Item Response Theory, using 
      data of 666 COPD patients. RESULTS: The final item bank contains 46 items that 
      form a strong scale, tapping into eight important themes that were identified 
      based on literature review and patient interviews: Coping with disease/symptoms, 
      adaptability; Autonomy; Anxiety about the course/end-state of the disease, 
      hopelessness; Positive psychological functioning; Situations triggering or 
      enhancing breathing problems; Symptoms; Activity; Impact. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      46-item COPD-SIB has good psychometric properties and content validity. Items are 
      available in Dutch and English. The COPD-SIB can be used as a stand-alone 
      instrument, or to inform computerised adaptive testing.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Computerized-Adaptive Test for PTSD (P-CAT).
PG  - 1116-1123
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to develop, field test, and validate a 
      computerized-adaptive test (CAT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to 
      enhance PTSD assessment and decrease the burden of symptom monitoring. METHODS: 
      Data sources included self-report and interviewer-administered diagnostic 
      interviews. The sample included 1,288 veterans. In phase 1, 89 items from a 
      previously developed PTSD item pool were administered to a national sample of 
      1,085 veterans. A multidimensional graded-response item response theory model was 
      used to calibrate items for incorporation into a CAT for PTSD (P-CAT). In phase 
      2, in a separate sample of 203 veterans, the P-CAT was validated against three 
      other self-report measures (PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version; Mississippi Scale 
      for Combat-Related PTSD; and Primary Care PTSD Screen) and the PTSD module of the 
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: A bifactor model with one 
      general PTSD factor and four subfactors consistent with DSM-5 (reexperiencing, 
      avoidance, negative mood-cognitions, and arousal), yielded good fit. The P-CAT 
      discriminated veterans with PTSD from those with other mental health conditions 
      and those with no mental health conditions (Cohen's d effect sizes >.90). The 
      P-CAT also discriminated those with and without a PTSD diagnosis and those who 
      screened positive versus negative for PTSD. Concurrent validity was supported by 
      high correlations (r=.85-.89) with the validation measures. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      P-CAT appears to be a promising tool for efficient and accurate assessment of 
      PTSD symptomatology. Further testing is needed to evaluate its responsiveness to 
      change. With increasing availability of computers and other technologies, CAT may 
      be a viable and efficient assessment method.

TI  - An evaluation of computerized adaptive testing for general psychological 
      distress: combining GHQ-12 and Affectometer-2 in an item bank for public mental 
      health research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in psychometric modeling and technology allow 
      pooling well-validated items from existing instruments into larger item banks and 
      their deployment through methods of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Use of 
      item response theory-based bifactor methods and integrative data analysis 
      overcomes barriers in cross-instrument comparison. This paper presents the joint 
      calibration of an item bank for researchers keen to investigate population 
      variations in general psychological distress (GPD). METHODS: Multidimensional 
      item response theory was used on existing health survey data from the Scottish 
      Health Education Population Survey (n = 766) to calibrate an item bank consisting 
      of pooled items from the short common mental disorder screen (GHQ-12) and the 
      Affectometer-2 (a measure of "general happiness"). Computer simulation was used 
      to evaluate usefulness and efficacy of its adaptive administration. RESULTS: A 
      bifactor model capturing variation across a continuum of population distress 
      (while controlling for artefacts due to item wording) was supported. The numbers 
      of items for different required reliabilities in adaptive administration 
      demonstrated promising efficacy of the proposed item bank. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Psychometric modeling of the common dimension captured by more than one 
      instrument offers the potential of adaptive testing for GPD using individually 
      sequenced combinations of existing survey items. The potential for linking other 
      item sets with alternative candidate measures of positive mental health is 
      discussed since an optimal item bank may require even more items than these.

TI  - The experience of depression, anxiety, and mania among perinatal women.
PG  - 883-90
LID - 10.1007/s00737-016-0632-6 [doi]
AB  - We assessed differential item functioning (DIF) based on computerized adaptive 
      testing (CAT) to examine how perinatal mood disorders differ from adult 
      psychiatric disorders. The CAT-Mental Health (CAT-MH) was administered to 1614 
      adult psychiatric outpatients and 419 perinatal women with IRB approval. We 
      examined individual item-level differences using logistic regression and overall 
      score differences by scoring the perinatal data using the original bifactor model 
      calibration based on the psychiatric sample data and a new bifactor model 
      calibration based on the perinatal data and computing their correlation. To 
      examine convergent validity, we computed correlations of the CAT-MH with 
      contemporaneously administered Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS). The 
      rate of major depression in the perinatal sample was 13 %. Rates of anxiety, 
      mania, and suicide risk were 5, 6, and 0.4 %, respectively. One of 66 depression 
      items, one of 69 anxiety items, and 15 of 53 mania items exhibited DIF (i.e., 
      failure to discriminate between high and low levels of the disorder) in the 
      perinatal sample based on the psychiatric sample calibration. Removal of these 
      items resulted in correlations of the original and perinatal calibrations of 
      r = 0.983 for depression, r = 0.986 for anxiety, and r = 0.932 for mania. The 
      91.3 % of cases were concordantly categorized as either "at-risk" or "low-risk" 
      between the EPDS and the perinatal calibration of the CAT-MH. There was little 
      evidence of DIF for depression and anxiety symptoms in perinatal women. This was 
      not true for mania. Now calibrated for perinatal women, the CAT-MH can be 
      evaluated for longitudinal symptom monitoring.

TI  - Is Social Support Associated With Upper Extremity Disability?
PG  - 1830-6
LID - 10.1007/s11999-016-4892-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain intensity and disability correlate with psychosocial factors 
      such as depression and pain interference (the degree to which pain interferes 
      with activities of daily living) as much or more than pathophysiology in upper 
      extremity illness. However, other factors like emotional support (perception of 
      being cared for and valued as a person), instrumental support (perception of 
      availability of tangible assistance when needed), positive psychosocial impact 
      (perception and focus on the positive side of a difficult situation, sometimes 
      characterized as posttraumatic growth, benefit-finding, or meaning making), also 
      might be associated with disability in patients with upper extremity orthopaedic 
      illness. This is the first published study, to our knowledge, addressing the 
      potential association of emotional support, instrumental support, and positive 
      psychosocial illness impact with disability in patients with upper extremity 
      illness. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Is there a correlation between the 
      QuickDASH and the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS((R))) emotional support Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT)? (2) Is there a 
      correlation between the QuickDASH and PROMIS((R)) instrumental support CAT? (3) Is 
      there a correlation between the QuickDASH and PROMIS((R)) positive psychosocial 
      illness impact CAT? (4) Among the PROMIS((R)) measures of depression, emotional 
      support, instrumental support, positive illness impact, and pain interference, 
      which accounts for the most variance in QuickDASH scores? METHODS: One hundred 
      ninety-three patients with upper extremity illness (55% women; average age, 51 +/- 
      18 years) of 213 approached (91% recruitment rate) completed the QuickDASH, and 
      five different PROMIS((R)) CATs: pain interference (the degree to which pain 
      interferes with accomplishing one's goals), depression, emotional support, 
      psychosocial illness impact, and instrumental support. We recruited patients from 
      the practice of three surgeons in hand service of the department of orthopaedic 
      surgery at a major urban university hospital. RESULTS: Pearson Product Moment 
      Correlations showed that emotional support (r = -0.18; p = 0.014) and 
      instrumental support (r = -0.19; p = 0.008) were weakly and inversely associated 
      with the QuickDASH), while positive psychosocial illness impact was moderately 
      and inversely associated with the QuickDASH (r = -0.36; p < 0.001). In 
      multivariable analyses, pain interference, but not the social support measures, 
      was the only psychosocial factor associated with the QuickDASH and alone 
      explained 66% of variance. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional support, instrumental support 
      and positive psychosocial illness impact are all individually associated with 
      disability to a small degree, but pain interference (the degree to which pain 
      interferes with accomplishing one's goals) has the strongest influence on 
      magnitude of disability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the precision and construct validity of pediatric 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments in 
      a population of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients and parent proxies. 
      METHODS: A convenience sample of JIA patients and parents of JIA patients 
      completed PROMIS instruments for 8 domains: anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, 
      fatigue, mobility, pain interference, peer relationships, and upper-extremity 
      function. Short form and computerized adaptive test (CAT) scores were derived 
      from item bank responses. Raw scores were translated to standardized T scores 
      with corresponding SEs. Discrimination between inactive versus active disease was 
      evaluated as an indicator of each measure's construct validity. SEs were plotted 
      to evaluate each instrument's relative precision. Patient-parent concordance was 
      assessed using intraclass correlations (ICCs). RESULTS: A total of 228 patients 
      and 223 parents participated, providing 71-78 responses per domain. Patient- and 
      parent-reported anger, fatigue, mobility, and pain interference scores 
      significantly differed between those with inactive and active disease. Anxiety, 
      depressive symptoms, and peer relationships differed by disease activity levels 
      for parent-report only. Short forms and CATs provided comparable reliability to 
      the full item banks across the full range of each outcome. Patient-parent 
      agreement ranged from ICC 0.3 to 0.8. CATs did not reduce the number of items for 
      any domain compared to the short form. CONCLUSION: Precision and discriminatory 
      abilities of PROMIS instruments depend on health domain and report type 
      (self-report versus parent proxy-report) for children with JIA. Varying levels of 
      patient-parent concordance reinforces the importance of considering both 
      perspectives in comprehensive health outcomes assessments.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this case report was to describe changes in body 
      functions and structures, activities, and participation after a biweekly 10-week 
      program of home physical therapy and hippotherapy using a weighted compressor 
      belt. PARTICIPANT: A 13-year-old boy with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, Gross 
      Motor Function Classification System level II, was referred because of 
      accelerated growth and functional impairments that limited daily activities. 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The Modified Ashworth Scale, passive range of motion, 1-Minute 
      Walk Test, Timed Up and Down Stairs, Pediatric Balance Scale, Pediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, and Dimensions of 
      Mastery Questionnaire 17 were examined at baseline, 5, and 10 weeks. OUTCOMES: 
      Data at 5 and 10 weeks demonstrated positive changes in passive range of motion, 
      balance, strength, functional activities, and motivation, with additional 
      improvements in endurance and speed after 10 weeks. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This 
      report reveals enhanced body functions and structures and activities and improved 
      participation and motivation.

PG  - 1039-41

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) provides improved precision and 
      decreased test burden compared with traditional, fixed-length tests. Concerns 
      have been raised regarding reliability of CAT-based measurements because the 
      items administered vary both between and within individuals over time. The study 
      measured test-retest reliability of the CAT Depression Inventory (CAT-DI) for 
      assessment of depression in a screening setting where most scores fall in the 
      normal range. METHODS: A random sample of adults (N=101) at an academic emergency 
      department (ED) was screened twice with the CAT-DI during their visit. 
      Test-retest scores, bias, and reliability were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen 
      percent of patients scored in the mild range for depression, 4% in the moderate 
      range, and 3% in the severe range. Test-retest scores were without significant 
      bias and had excellent reliability (r=.92). CONCLUSIONS: The CAT-DI provided 
      reliable screening results among ED patients. Concerns about whether changes in 
      item presentation during repeat testing would affect test-retest reliability were 
      not supported.

TI  - Pain Threshold Tests in Patients With Heel Pain Syndrome.
PG  - 730-6
LID - 10.1177/1071100716642038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is a useful tool for evaluating 
      mechanical sensitivity in patients suffering from various musculoskeletal 
      disorders. However, no previous study has investigated PPT in the heel of 
      patients experiencing plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS). The aim of this study 
      was to compare PPT levels and topographic presentation of sensitivity in the heel 
      of patients with PHPS and in healthy controls. METHODS: The reliability of PPT 
      testing in patients with PHPS was assessed for intra- and interrater recordings. 
      The PPT levels of 40 feet in each group were then assessed on 5 predetermined 
      sites in the heel using a standardized measurement protocol. Patient functional 
      status (FS) as measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was 
      employed as an external reference. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of covariance 
      revealed no group differences for PPTs at all sites (P = .406). Age (P = .099) or 
      BMI (P = .510) did not affect PPT values, although there was an effect on gender 
      (P = .006). The analysis revealed significant differences between sites (P < 
      .001) demonstrating a diverse topographic distribution. In the PHPS group, PPT 
      levels at the anterior/medial, posterior/medial and central sites were 
      significantly lower than at the posterior/lateral and anterior/lateral sites (P < 
      .05). For the control group, PPT levels at the anterior/medial site were 
      significantly lower than all other sites (P < .001). CONCLUSION: No significant 
      differences were found between PPT of the PHPS patients and controls, therefore, 
      PPT cannot be recommended as an assessment tool for these patients. The 
      topographic distribution indicated low PPT levels at the anterior/medial area of 
      the heel in patients with PHPS and controls. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, 
      comparative study.

TI  - Preeclampsia: Long-term effects on pediatric disability.
PG  - 41-8
LID - 10.3233/NPM-16915065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia affects up to 10% of pregnancies worldwide and is one of 
      the main causes of fetal morbidity and mortality. Although it has been linked to 
      developmental delay, its long-term effects on neurologic development in children 
      have yet to be sufficiently quantified. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether 
      preeclampsia's severity and its obstetric management correlate to the degree of 
      disability in these infants. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This is an observational and 
      descriptive study performed on a population of 96 women who were diagnosed with 
      preeclampsia at Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon between 2007 and 
      2014, and their 111 children. To evaluate the mother, we gathered data pertaining 
      to her medical history, renal function markers, and medical management of the 
      preeclampsia. To assess the children, we collected fetal growth measurements, 
      acute fetal distress markers and main diagnoses at birth. We used the Pediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory in its computerized adaptive test version 
      (PEDI-CAT) to study performance in the relevant areas, and the TNO-AZL Preschool 
      children Quality of Life (TAPQOL) to estimate health-related quality of life. 
      RESULTS: PEDI-CAT percentiles were consistently lower in the social/cognitive 
      domain than in other areas. Lower social/cognitive percentiles were associated to 
      both lower maternal IgG levels and presence of necrotizing enterocolitis during 
      the neonatal period. CONCLUSIONS: A connection between preeclampsia and poor 
      social/cognitive outcomes exists that warrants further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      includes five item banks for alcohol use. There are limited data, however, 
      regarding their validity (e.g., convergent validity, responsiveness to change). 
      To provide such data, we conducted a prospective study with 225 outpatients being 
      treated for substance abuse. METHODS: Assessments were completed shortly after 
      intake and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. The alcohol item banks were 
      administered as computerized adaptive tests (CATs). Fourteen CATs and one 
      six-item short form were also administered from eight other PROMIS domains to 
      generate a comprehensive health status profile. After modeling treatment outcome 
      for the sample as a whole, correlates of outcome from the PROMIS health status 
      profile were examined. RESULTS: For convergent validity, the largest correlation 
      emerged between the PROMIS alcohol use score and the Alcohol Use Disorders 
      Identification Test (r=.79 at intake). Regarding treatment outcome, there were 
      modest changes across the target problem of alcohol use and other domains of the 
      PROMIS health status profile. However, significant heterogeneity was found in 
      initial severity of drinking and in rates of change for both abstinence and 
      severity of drinking during follow-up. This heterogeneity was associated with 
      demographic (e.g., gender) and health-profile (e.g., emotional support, social 
      participation) variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the validity of 
      PROMIS CATs, which require only 4-6 items in each domain. This efficiency makes 
      it feasible to use a comprehensive health status profile within the substance use 
      treatment setting, providing important prognostic information regarding 
      abstinence and severity of drinking.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness to 
      change of the PROMIS negative affect measures (depression, anxiety, and anger) 
      using longitudinal data collected in six chronic health conditions. STUDY DESIGN 
      AND SETTING: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), back pain, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and cancer 
      completed PROMIS negative affect instruments as computerized adaptive test or as 
      fixed-length short form at baseline and a clinically relevant follow-up interval. 
      Participants also completed global ratings of health. Linear mixed effects models 
      and standardized response means (SRM) were estimated at baseline and follow-up. 
      RESULTS: A total of 903 individuals participated (back pain, n = 218; cancer, 
      n = 304; CHF, n = 60; COPD, n = 125; MDD, n = 196). All three negative affect 
      instruments improved significantly for treatments of depression and pain. 
      Depression improved for CHF patients (anxiety and anger not administered), 
      whereas anxiety improved significantly in COPD groups (stable and exacerbation). 
      Response to treatment was not assessed in cancer. Subgroups of patients reporting 
      better or worse health showed a corresponding positive or negative average SRM 
      for negative affect across samples. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that 
      the PROMIS negative affect scores are sensitive to change in intervention studies 
      in which negative affect is expected to change. These results inform the 
      estimation of meaningful change and enable comparative effectiveness research.

TI  - Item bank development, calibration and validation for patient-reported outcomes 
      in female urinary incontinence.
PG  - 1645-54

AB  - PURPOSE: Current patient-reported outcomes for female urinary incontinence (UI) 
      are limited by their inability to be tailored. Our objective is to describe the 
      development and field testing of seven item banks designed to measure domains 
      identified as important UI in females (UIf). We also describe the calibration and 
      validation properties of the UIf-item banks, which allow for more efficient 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in the future. METHODS: The UIf-measures 
      included 168 items covering seven domains: Stress UI (SUI), overactive bladder 
      (OAB), urinary frequency, physical, social and emotional health impact and 
      adaptation. Items underwent rigorous qualitative development and psychometric 
      testing across two sites. Items were calibrated using item response theory and 
      evaluated for internal consistency, construct validity and responsiveness. 
      RESULTS: A total of 750 women (249 SUI, 249 OAB and 252 mixed UI) participated. 
      Mean age was 55 +/- 14 years, and 23 % were Hispanic and 80 % white. In addition to 
      face and content validity, the measures demonstrated good internal consistency 
      (coefficient alpha 0.92-0.98) and unidimensionality. There was evidence for 
      construct validity with moderate-to-strong correlations with the UDI (r's >/= 0.6) 
      and IIQ (r's = >/=0.6) scales. The measures were responsive to change for SUI 
      treatment (paired t test p < .001, ES range 1.3-2.9; SRM range 1.3-2.5) and OAB 
      treatment (paired t test p < .05 for all domains except social health impact and 
      adaptation, ES range 0.3-1.5, SRM range 0.4-1.0). The measures were responsive 
      based on concurrent changes with the UDI and IIQ (p < 0.05). CAT versions were 
      developed and pilot-tested. CONCLUSIONS: The UIf-item banks demonstrate good 
      psychometric characteristics and are a sufficiently valid set of customizable 
      tools for measuring UI symptoms and life impact.

TI  - Measurement Equivalence of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System((R)) (PROMIS((R))) Pain Interference Short Form Items: Application to 
      Ethnically Diverse Cancer and Palliative Care Populations.
PG  - 309-352
AB  - Reducing the response burden of standardized pain measures is desirable, 
      particularly for individuals who are frail or live with chronic illness, e.g., 
      those suffering from cancer and those in palliative care. The Patient Reported 
      Outcome Measurement Information System((R)) (PROMIS((R))) project addressed this 
      issue with the provision of computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and short form 
      measures that can be used clinically and in research. Although there has been 
      substantial evaluation of PROMIS item banks, little is known about the 
      performance of PROMIS short forms, particularly in ethnically diverse groups. 
      Reviewed in this article are findings related to the differential item 
      functioning (DIF) and reliability of the PROMIS pain interference short forms 
      across diverse sociodemographic groups. METHODS: DIF hypotheses were generated 
      for the PROMIS short form pain interference items. Initial analyses tested item 
      response theory (IRT) model assumptions of unidimensionality and local 
      independence. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor analytic methods; local 
      dependence (LD) was tested using IRT-based LD indices. Wald tests were used to 
      examine group differences in IRT parameters, and to test DIF hypotheses. A second 
      DIF-detection method used in sensitivity analyses was based on ordinal logistic 
      regression with a latent IRT-derived conditioning variable. Magnitude and impact 
      of DIF were investigated, and reliability and item and scale information 
      statistics were estimated. RESULTS: The reliability of the short form item set 
      was excellent. However, there were a few items with high local dependency, which 
      affected the estimation of the final discrimination parameters. As a result, the 
      item, "How much did pain interfere with enjoyment of social activities?" was 
      excluded in the DIF analyses for all subgroup comparisons. No items were 
      hypothesized to show DIF for race and ethnicity; however, five items showed DIF 
      after adjustment for multiple comparisons in both primary and sensitivity 
      analyses: ability to concentrate, enjoyment of recreational activities, tasks 
      away from home, participation in social activities, and socializing with others. 
      The magnitude of DIF was small and the impact negligible. Three items were 
      consistently identified with DIF for education: enjoyment of life, ability to 
      concentrate, and enjoyment of recreational activities. No item showed DIF above 
      the magnitude threshold and the impact of DIF on the overall measure was minimal. 
      No item showed gender DIF after correction for multiple comparisons in the 
      primary analyses. Four items showed consistent age DIF: enjoyment of life, 
      ability to concentrate, day to day activities, and enjoyment of recreational 
      activities, none with primary magnitude values above threshold. Conditional on 
      the pain state, Spanish speakers were hypothesized to report less pain 
      interference on one item, enjoyment of life. The DIF findings confirmed the 
      hypothesis; however, the magnitude was small. Using an arbitrary cutoff point of 
      theta (theta) >/= 1.0 to classify respondents with acute pain interference, the highest 
      number of changes were for the education groups analyses. There were 231 
      respondents (4% of the total sample) who changed from the designation of no acute 
      pain interference to acute interference after the DIF adjustment. There was no 
      change in the designations for race/ethnic subgroups, and a small number of 
      changes for respondents aged 65 to 84. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant DIF was 
      observed after correction for multiple comparisons, all DIF was of low magnitude 
      and impact. However, some individual-level impact was observed for low education 
      groups. Reliability estimates were high. Thus, the PROMIS short form pain items 
      examined in this ethnically diverse sample performed relatively well; although 
      one item was problematic and removed from the analyses. It is concluded that the 
      majority of the PROMIS pain interference short form items can be recommended for 
      use among ethnically diverse groups, including those in palliative care and with 
      cancer and chronic illness.

PG  - 953-62
LID - 10.1037/pas0000240 [doi]
AB  - In a post hoc simulation study (N = 3,597 psychiatric outpatients), we 
      investigated whether the efficiency of the 90-item Mood and Anxiety Symptom 
      Questionnaire (MASQ) could be improved for assessing clinical subjects with 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A CAT simulation was performed on each of 
      the 3 MASQ subscales (Positive Affect, Negative Affect, and Somatic Anxiety). 
      With the CAT simulation's stopping rule set at a high level of measurement 
      precision, the results showed that patients' test administration can be shortened 
      substantially; the mean decrease in items used for the subscales ranged from 56% 
      up to 74%. Furthermore, the predictive utility of the CAT simulations was 
      sufficient for all MASQ scales. The findings reveal that developing a MASQ CAT 
      for clinical subjects is useful as it leads to more efficient measurement without 
      compromising the reliability of the test outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Computerized adaptive testing of population psychological distress: 
      simulation-based evaluation of GHQ-30.
PG  - 895-906
LID - 10.1007/s00127-015-1157-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) items are frequently used 
      to assess psychological distress but no study to date has investigated the 
      GHQ-30's potential for adaptive administration. In computerized adaptive testing 
      (CAT) items are matched optimally to the targeted distress level of respondents 
      instead of relying on fixed-length versions of instruments. We therefore 
      calibrate GHQ-30 items and report a simulation study exploring the potential of 
      this instrument for adaptive administration in a longitudinal setting. METHODS: 
      GHQ-30 responses of 3445 participants with 2 completed assessments (baseline, 
      7-year follow-up) in the UK Health and Lifestyle Survey were calibrated using 
      item response theory. Our simulation study evaluated the efficiency of CAT 
      administration of the items, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with different 
      estimators, item selection methods, and measurement precision criteria. RESULTS: 
      To yield accurate distress measurements (marginal reliability at least 0.90) 
      nearly all GHQ-30 items need to be administered to most survey respondents in 
      general population samples. When lower accuracy is permissible (marginal 
      reliability of 0.80), adaptive administration saves approximately 2/3 of the 
      items. For longitudinal applications, change scores based on the complete set of 
      GHQ-30 items correlate highly with change scores from adaptive administrations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The rationale for CAT-GHQ-30 is only supported when the required 
      marginal reliability is lower than 0.9, which is most likely to be the case in 
      cross-sectional and longitudinal studies assessing mean changes in populations. 
      Precise measurement of psychological distress at the individual level can be 
      achieved, but requires the deployment of all 30 items.

AB  - In this review we explore recent developments in computerized adaptive diagnostic 
      screening and computerized adaptive testing for the presence and severity of 
      mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and mania. The statistical 
      methodology is unique in that it is based on multidimensional item response 
      theory (severity) and random forests (diagnosis) instead of traditional mental 
      health measurement based on classical test theory (a simple total score) or 
      unidimensional item response theory. We show that the information contained in 
      large item banks consisting of hundreds of symptom items can be efficiently 
      calibrated using multidimensional item response theory, and the information 
      contained in these large item banks can be precisely extracted using adaptive 
      administration of a small set of items for each individual. In terms of 
      diagnosis, computerized adaptive diagnostic screening can accurately track an 
      hour-long face-to-face clinician diagnostic interview for major depressive 
      disorder (as an example) in less than a minute using an average of four questions 
      with unprecedented high sensitivity and specificity. Directions for future 
      research and applications are discussed.

TI  - A New Online Calibration Method for Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive 
      Testing.
PG  - 674-701
LID - 10.1007/s11336-015-9482-9 [doi]
AB  - Multidimensional-Method A (M-Method A) has been proposed as an efficient and 
      effective online calibration method for multidimensional computerized adaptive 
      testing (MCAT) (Chen & Xin, Paper presented at the 78th Meeting of the 
      Psychometric Society, Arnhem, The Netherlands, 2013). However, a key assumption 
      of M-Method A is that it treats person parameter estimates as their true values, 
      thus this method might yield erroneous item calibration when person parameter 
      estimates contain non-ignorable measurement errors. To improve the performance of 
      M-Method A, this paper proposes a new MCAT online calibration method, namely, the 
      full functional MLE-M-Method A (FFMLE-M-Method A). This new method combines the 
      full functional MLE (Jones & Jin in Psychometrika 59:59-75, 1994; Stefanski & 
      Carroll in Annals of Statistics 13:1335-1351, 1985) with the original M-Method A 
      in an effort to correct for the estimation error of ability vector that might 
      otherwise adversely affect the precision of item calibration. Two correction 
      schemes are also proposed when implementing the new method. A simulation study 
      was conducted to show that the new method generated more accurate item parameter 
      estimation than the original M-Method A in almost all conditions.

LID - 10.1016/j.jhsa.2015.07.031 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between the total area marked on pain and 
      numbness diagrams and psychosocial factors (depression, pain catastrophic 
      thinking, and health anxiety). METHODS: A total of 155 patients marked painful 
      and numb areas on separate hand diagrams. Patients also completed demographic, 
      condition-related, and psychosocial (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression Computer Adaptive Test, and 
      Short Health Anxiety Inventory) questionnaires. Bivariate and multivariable 
      analyses were used to determine factors associated with total area marked on the 
      pain and numbness diagrams. RESULTS: The total area marked on the pain diagram 
      correlated with catastrophic thinking, symptoms of depression, and health 
      anxiety. In multivariable analysis, catastrophic thinking was the sole predictor 
      of marked pain area, accounting for 10% of variance in the hand pain diagram. The 
      total area marked on the numbness diagram correlated with the interval between 
      onset and visit, diagnosis, catastrophic thinking, and symptoms of depression. In 
      multivariable analysis, the interval between onset and visit, a diagnosis of 
      carpal tunnel syndrome, and catastrophic thinking were independently associated 
      with total area marked on the hand numbness diagram. CONCLUSIONS: Catastrophic 
      thinking was independently associated with larger pain and numbness areas on a 
      hand diagram. This suggests that larger symptom markings on hand diagrams may 
      indicate less effective coping strategies. Hand diagrams might be used as a basis 
      for discussion of coping strategies and illness behavior in patients with upper 
      extremity conditions. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve measurement precision, the European Organisation for 
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is developing an 
      item bank for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of emotional functioning (EF). 
      The item bank will be within the conceptual framework of the widely used EORTC 
      Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ-C30). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: On the basis 
      of literature search and evaluations by international samples of experts and 
      cancer patients, 38 candidate items were developed. The psychometric properties 
      of the items were evaluated in a large international sample of cancer patients. 
      This included evaluations of dimensionality, item response theory (IRT) model 
      fit, differential item functioning (DIF), and of measurement 
      precision/statistical power. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 1,023 cancer 
      patients from four countries. The evaluations showed that 24 items could be 
      included in a unidimensional IRT model. DIF did not seem to have any significant 
      impact on the estimation of EF. Evaluations indicated that the CAT measure may 
      reduce sample size requirements by up to 50% compared to the QLQ-C30 EF scale 
      without reducing power. CONCLUSION: On the basis of thorough psychometric 
      evaluations, we have established an EF item bank of 24 items. This will allow for 
      more precise and flexible measurement of EF, while maintaining backward 
      compatibility with the QLQ-C30 EF scale.

TI  - The effect of feedback regarding coping strategies and illness behavior on hand 
      surgery patient satisfaction and communication: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 503-11
LID - 10.1007/s11552-015-9742-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients and surgeons can feel uncomfortable discussing coping 
      strategies, psychological distress, and stressful circumstances. It has been 
      suggested that patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) facilitate the 
      discussion of factors associated with increased symptoms and disability. This 
      study assessed the effect of providing feedback to patients regarding their 
      coping strategy and illness behavior on patient satisfaction and 
      patient-physician communication in orthopedic surgery. METHODS: In a prospective 
      study, 136 orthopedic patients were randomly assigned to either receive feedback 
      about the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain 
      Interference computer-adaptive test (CAT) prior to the visit with the hand 
      surgeon or not. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction with the 
      consultation and secondary outcomes involved patient-physician communication. 
      Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the influence of 
      the feedback on patient satisfaction and communication. RESULTS: There was no 
      significant difference in patient satisfaction between patients who received 
      feedback and patients who did not (P = 0.70). Feedback was associated with more 
      frequent discussion of coping strategies (P = 0.045) in bivariate analysis but 
      was not independently associated: in multivariable analysis, only PROMIS Pain 
      Interference CAT and age were identified as independent predictors (odds ratio 
      (OR) 1.1; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.0-1.1, P = 0.013, and OR 0.97, 95 % CI 
      0.94-0.99, P = 0.032, respectively). No factors were associated with discussion 
      of stressors. Discussion of circumstances was independently associated with 
      increased PROMIS Pain Interference CAT, marital status, and work status. 
      CONCLUSION: We found that feedback regarding coping strategies and illness 
      behavior using the PROMIS Pain Interference CAT did not affect patient 
      satisfaction. Although feedback was associated with increased discussion of 
      illness behavior in bivariate analysis, less effective coping strategies and 
      personal factors (age, marital status, and work status) were more important 
      factors.

TI  - From "aisle" to "labile": A hierarchical National Adult Reading Test scale 
      revealed by Mokken scaling.
PG  - 932-43
LID - 10.1037/pas0000091 [doi]
AB  - Decline in cognitive ability is a core diagnostic criterion for dementia. Knowing 
      the extent of decline requires a baseline score from which change can be 
      reckoned. In the absence of prior cognitive ability scores, vocabulary-based 
      cognitive tests are used to estimate premorbid cognitive ability. It is important 
      that such tests are short yet informative, to maximize information and 
      practicability. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) is commonly used to 
      estimate premorbid intelligence. People are asked to pronounce 50 words ranging 
      from easy to difficult but whether its words conform to a hierarchy is unknown. 
      Five hundred eighty-seven healthy community-dwelling older people with known age 
      11 IQ scores completed the NART as part of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study. 
      Mokken analysis was used to explore item responses for unidimensional, ordinal, 
      and hierarchical scales. A strong hierarchical scale ("mini-NART") of 23 of the 
      50 items was identified. These items are invariantly ordered across all ability 
      levels. The validity of the interpretation of this briefer scale's score as an 
      estimate of premorbid ability was examined using the actual age 11 IQ score. The 
      mini-NART accounted for a similar amount of the variance in age 11 IQ as the full 
      NART (NART = 46.5%, mini-NART = 44.8%). The mini-NART is proposed as a useful 
      short clinical tool to estimate prior cognitive ability. The mini-NART has 
      clinical relevance, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items 
      allowing for sensitive measurement, and adaptive testing, reducing test 
      administration time, and patient stress.

TI  - The Usability of CAT System for Assessing the Depressive Level of Japanese-A 
      Study on Psychometric Properties and Response Behavior.
PG  - 427-37
LID - 10.1007/s12529-015-9503-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An innovative measurement system using a computerized adaptive 
      testing technique based on the item response theory (CAT) has been expanding to 
      measure mental health status. However, little is known about details in its 
      measurement properties based on the empirical data. Moreover, the response time 
      (RT) data, which are not available by a paper-and-pencil measurement but 
      available by a computerized measurement, would be worth investigating for 
      exploring the response behavior. PURPOSE: We aimed at constructing the CAT to 
      measure depressive symptomatology in a community population and exploring its 
      measurement properties. Also, we examined the relationships between RTs, 
      individual item responses, and depressive levels. METHOD: For constructing the 
      CAT system, responses of 2061 workers and university students to 24 depression 
      scale plus four negatively revised positive affect items were subjected to a 
      polytomous IRT analysis. The stopping rule was set for standard error of 
      estimation < 0.30 or the maximum 15 items displayed. The CAT and non-adaptive 
      computer-based test (CBT) were administered to 209 undergraduates, and 168 of 
      them administered again after 1 week. RESULTS: On average, the CAT was converged 
      by 10.4 items. The theta values estimated by CAT and CBT were highly correlated 
      (r = 0.94 and 0.95 for the 1st and 2nd measurements) and with the traditional 
      scoring procedures (r's > 0.90). The test-retest reliability was at a 
      satisfactory level (r = 0.86). RTs to some items significantly correlated with 
      the theta estimates. The mean RT varied by the item contents and wording, i.e., the 
      RT to positive affect items required additional 2 s or longer than the other 
      subscale items. CONCLUSION: The CAT would be a reliable and practical measurement 
      tool for various purposes including stress check at workplace.

AB  - The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was devised 
      to facilitate assessment of patient self-reported health status, taking advantage 
      of Item Response Theory. We aimed to assess measurement properties of the PROMIS 
      Depression item bank and an 8-item static short form in a Spanish clinical 
      sample. A three-month follow-up study of patients with active mood/anxiety 
      symptoms (n = 218) was carried out. We assessed model unidimensionality 
      (Confirmatory Item Factor Analysis), reliability (internal consistency and Item 
      Information Curves), and validity (convergent-discriminant with correlations; 
      known-groups with comparison of means and effect sizes; and criterion validity 
      with Receiver operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis). We also assessed 3-month 
      responsiveness to change (Cohen's effect sizes (d) in stable and recovered 
      patients). The unidimensional model showed adequate fit (CFI = 0.97, RMSEA = 
      0.08). Information Curves had reliabilities over 0.90 throughout most of the 
      score continuum. As expected, we observed high correlations with external 
      self-reported depression, and moderate with self-reported anxiety and clinical 
      measures. The item bank showed an increasing severity gradient from no disorder 
      (mean = 48, SE = 0.6) to depression with comorbid anxiety (mean = 55.8, SE = 
      0.4). PROMIS detected depression disorder with great accuracy according to the 
      area under the curve (AUC = 0.89). Both formats, item bank and short form, were 
      highly responsive to change in recovered patients (d > 0.7) and had small changes 
      in stable patients (d < 0.2). The good metric properties of the Spanish PROMIS 
      Depression measures provide further evidence of their adequacy for monitoring 
      depression levels of patients in clinical settings. This double check of quality 
      (within countries and populations) supports the ability of PROMIS measures for 
      guaranteeing fair comparisons across languages and countries in specific clinical 
      populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of an adaptive speech 
      recognition protocol (NSRT((R))) that can be self-administered in non-clinical 
      venues by listeners using internet-based software. DESIGN: All participants were 
      given an audiological evaluation, including pure-tone testing, and responded to 
      the NSRT administered in quiet and + 5 dB SNR listening conditions. The NSRT test 
      materials are sentence-length utterances containing phonetic contrasts, primarily 
      minimal pairs. STUDY SAMPLE: Subjects were 123 adults with normal hearing to 
      moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss (mean age = 55 years, SD = 23). 
      RESULTS: Performance on the NSRT is strongly related to pure-tone thresholds. 
      Linear regression analyses support the utility of the NSRT as a proxy for 
      clinically-obtained hearing thresholds across the octave frequencies 0.5 to 8 
      kHz, primarily for individuals in the - 10 to 55 dB HL range. Other NSRT results 
      are linked to analyses of phonetic errors and components of aural rehabilitation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among its numerous results, the NSRT yields quantitative predictions 
      of frequency-specific hearing thresholds, provides insight into the phonetic 
      errors that affect speech understanding in adults who suffer from sensorineural 
      hearing loss, primarily in the - 10 to 55 dB HL range, and has implications for 
      the design of individualized auditory training programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are 
      diagnosed without the classic signs of renal or osseous complications. Vague and 
      subjective symptoms have been attributed to PHPT but have been difficult to 
      measure during the medical encounter. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) of the National Institutes of Health contains 
      validated measures of physical and mental health that can be administered by the 
      use of computer-adaptive testing (CAT). The objective of this study was to 
      evaluate the feasibility of PROMIS assessment in the clinical setting to measure 
      changes in patient-reported health before and after parathyroidectomy. We 
      hypothesized that patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT would report 
      greater improvement in mental and physical health compared with control patients. 
      METHODS: Adult PHPT patients scheduled for parathyroidectomy and control patients 
      requiring diagnostic thyroid operation were enrolled prospectively during a 
      6-month period. Patients were administered clinically relevant PROMIS health 
      domains via CAT at a preoperative visit and 3 weeks after operation. A change in 
      score of 5 or greater for each PROMIS instrument was defined as clinically 
      important. Statistical significance of pre/post-surgery changes in scores was 
      determined using paired t tests. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with PHPT and 9 
      control patients completed the study. The mean number of PROMIS items answered 
      during an assessment was 67 (range 51-121, SD 15.4). Median completion time was 
      8.2 minutes (range 3.4-38.4, SD 4.7). Clinically important improvement after 
      parathyroidectomy in the PHPT group was greater than in the control group in 5 
      PROMIS domains. The score improvement experienced by PHPT patients was 8.8 in 
      Fatigue, 6.7 in Sleep-Related Impairment, 5.0 in Anxiety, 7.0 in Applied 
      Cognition, and 6.2 in Depression (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: PROMIS is an 
      efficient clinical assessment platform for measuring patient-reported outcomes in 
      PHPT via CAT. Several domains of physical and mental health in patients with PHPT 
      show statistically and clinically important improvement after parathyroidectomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) provides an alternative to 
      fixed-length assessments. The study validated a suite of computerized adaptive 
      tests for mental health (CAT-MH) in a community psychiatric sample. METHODS: A 
      total of 145 adults from a community outpatient clinic, including 19 with no 
      history of a mental disorder (control group), were prospectively evaluated with 
      CAT for depression (CAD-MDD and CAT-DI), mania (CAT-MANIA), and anxiety symptoms 
      (CAT-ANX). Ratings were compared with gold-standard psychiatric assessments, 
      including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID), Hamilton Rating 
      Scale for Depression (HAM-D-25), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Center for 
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Global Assessment of 
      Functioning (GAF). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for CAD-MDD were .96 and 
      .64, respectively (.96 and 1.00 for major depression versus the control group). 
      CAT for depression severity (CAT-DI) correlated well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.79), 
      PHQ-9 (r=.90), and CES-D (r=.90) and had an odds ratio (OR) of 27.88 across its 
      range for current SCID major depressive disorder. CAT-ANX correlated with the 
      HAM-D-25 (r=.73), PHQ-9 (r=.78), and CES-D (r=.81) and had an OR of 11.52 across 
      its range for current SCID generalized anxiety disorder. CAT-MANIA did not 
      correlate well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.31), PHQ-9 (r=.37), and CES-D (r=.39), but 
      it had an OR of 11.56 across its range for a current SCID bipolar diagnosis. 
      Participants found the CAT-MH acceptable and easy to use, averaging 51.7 items 
      and 9.4 minutes to complete the full battery. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 
      gold-standard diagnostic and assessment measures, CAT-MH provided an effective, 
      rapidly administered assessment of psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an item response theory (IRT)-calibrated spinal cord injury 
      (SCI)-specific Positive Affect and Well-being (PAWB) item bank with flexible 
      options for administration. DESIGN: Qualitative feedback from patient and 
      provider focus groups was used to expand on the Neurological Disorders and 
      Quality of Life (Neuro-QOL) positive affect & well-being item bank for use in 
      SCI. New items were created and revised based on expert review and patient 
      feedback and were then field tested. Analyses included confirmatory factor 
      analysis, graded response IRT modeling and evaluation of differential item 
      functioning (DIF). SETTING: We tested a 32-item pool at several rehabilitation 
      centers across the United States, including the University of Michigan, Kessler 
      Foundation, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the University of Washington, 
      Craig Hospital and the James J. Peters/Bronx Department of Veterans Affairs 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 717 individuals with SCI answered the PAWB 
      questions. RESULTS: A unidimensional model was observed (Confirmatory Fit 
      Index=0.947; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation=0.094) and measurement 
      precision was good (reliability in theta of -2.9 to 1.2 is roughly equivalent to 
      classical reliability of 0.95 or above). Twelve items were flagged for DIF, 
      however, after examination of effect sizes, the DIF was determined to be 
      negligible and would have little practical impact on score estimates. The final 
      calibrated item bank resulted in 28 retained items CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      indicates that the Spinal Cord Injury--Quality of Life PAWB bank represents a 
      psychometrically robust measurement tool. Short form items are also suggested and 
      a computer adaptive test is available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and psychometric properties of the SCI-QOL 
      Psychological Trauma item bank and short form. DESIGN: Using a mixed-methods 
      design, we developed and tested a Psychological Trauma item bank with patient and 
      provider focus groups, cognitive interviews, and item response theory based 
      analytic approaches, including tests of model fit, differential item functioning 
      (DIF) and precision. SETTING: We tested a 31-item pool at several medical 
      institutions across the United States, including the University of Michigan, 
      Kessler Foundation, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the University of 
      Washington, Craig Hospital and the James J. Peters/Bronx Veterans Administration 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 716 individuals with SCI completed the trauma 
      items RESULTS: The 31 items fit a unidimensional model (CFI=0.952; RMSEA=0.061) 
      and demonstrated good precision (theta range between 0.6 and 2.5). Nine items 
      demonstrated negligible DIF with little impact on score estimates. The final 
      calibrated item bank contains 19 items CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL Psychological 
      Trauma item bank is a psychometrically robust measurement tool from which a short 
      form and a computer adaptive test (CAT) version are available.

      factor analysis; graded response model item response theory analyses; statistical 
      linking techniques to transform scores to a PROMIS metric; and linkage with the 
      GAD-7. Setting Five SCI Model System centers and one Department of Veterans 
      Affairs medical center in the United States. Participants Adults with traumatic 
      SCI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spinal Cord Injury-Quality of Life (SCI-QOL) Anxiety 
      Item Bank RESULTS: Seven hundred sixteen individuals with traumatic SCI completed 
      38 items assessing anxiety, 17 of which were PROMIS items. After 13 items 
      (including 2 PROMIS items) were removed, factor analyses confirmed 
      unidimensionality. Item response theory analyses were used to estimate slopes and 
      thresholds for the final 25 items (15 from PROMIS). The observed Pearson 
      correlation between the SCI-QOL Anxiety and GAD-7 scores was 0.67. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The SCI-QOL Anxiety item bank demonstrates excellent psychometric properties and 
      is available as a computer adaptive test or short form for research and clinical 
      applications. SCI-QOL Anxiety scores have been transformed to the PROMIS metric 
      and we provide a method to link SCI-QOL Anxiety scores with those of the GAD-7.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive, psychometrically sound, and conceptually 
      grounded patient reported outcomes (PRO) measurement system for individuals with 
      spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Individual interviews (n=44) and focus groups 
      (n=65 individuals with SCI and n=42 SCI clinicians) were used to select key 
      domains for inclusion and to develop PRO items. Verbatim items from other 
      cutting-edge measurement systems (i.e. PROMIS, Neuro-QOL) were included to 
      facilitate linkage and cross-population comparison. Items were field tested in a 
      large sample of individuals with traumatic SCI (n=877). Dimensionality was 
      assessed with confirmatory factor analysis. Local item dependence and 
      differential item functioning were assessed, and items were calibrated using the 
      item response theory (IRT) graded response model. Finally, computer adaptive 
      tests (CATs) and short forms were administered in a new sample (n=245) to assess 
      test-retest reliability and stability. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES: A calibration 
      sample of 877 individuals with traumatic SCI across five SCI Model Systems sites 
      and one Department of Veterans Affairs medical center completed SCI-QOL items in 
      interview format. RESULTS: We developed 14 unidimensional calibrated item banks 
      and 3 calibrated scales across physical, emotional, and social health domains. 
      When combined with the five Spinal Cord Injury--Functional Index physical 
      function banks, the final SCI-QOL system consists of 22 IRT-calibrated item 
      banks/scales. Item banks may be administered as CATs or short forms. Scales may 
      be administered in a fixed-length format only. CONCLUSIONS: The SCI-QOL 
      measurement system provides SCI researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive, 
      relevant and psychometrically robust system for measurement of physical-medical, 
      physical-functional, emotional, and social outcomes. All SCI-QOL instruments are 
      freely available on Assessment CenterSM.

AB  - CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: The Spinal Cord Injury--Quality of Life (SCI-QOL) measurement 
      system was developed to address the shortage of relevant and psychometrically 
      sound patient reported outcome (PRO) measures available for clinical care and 
      research in spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Using a computer adaptive 
      testing (CAT) approach, the SCI-QOL builds on the Patient Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the Quality of Life in Neurological 
      Disorders (Neuro-QOL) initiative. This initial manuscript introduces the 
      background and development of the SCI-QOL measurement system. Greater detail is 
      presented in the additional manuscripts of this special issue. DESIGN: Classical 
      and contemporary test development methodologies were employed. Qualitative input 
      was obtained from individuals with SCI and clinicians through interviews, focus 
      groups, and cognitive debriefing. Item pools were field tested in a multi-site 
      sample (n=877) and calibrated using item response theory methods. Initial 
      reliability and validity testing was performed in a new sample of individuals 
      with traumatic SCI (n=245). SETTING: Five Model SCI System centers and one 
      Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center across the United States. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Adults with traumatic SCI. INTERVENTIONS: n/a OUTCOME MEASURES: n/a 
      RESULTS: The SCI-QOL consists of 19 item banks, including the SCI-Functional 
      Index banks, and 3 fixed-length scales measuring physical, emotional, and social 
      aspects of health-related QOL (HRQOL). CONCLUSION: The SCI-QOL measurement system 
      consists of psychometrically sound measures for individuals with SCI. The 
      manuscripts in this special issue provide evidence of the reliability and initial 
      validity of this measurement system. The SCI-QOL also links to other measures 
      designed for a general medical population.

TI  - The Psychometric Performance of the PROMIS Smoking Assessment Toolkit: 
      Comparisons of Real-Data Computer Adaptive Tests, Short Forms, and Mode of 
      Administration.
PG  - 361-5

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The PROMIS Smoking Initiative has developed six item banks for 
      assessment related to cigarette smoking among adult smokers (Nicotine Dependence, 
      Coping Expectancies, Emotional and Sensory Expectancies, Health Expectancies, 
      Psychosocial Expectancies, and Social Motivations). This article evaluates the 
      psychometric performance of the banks when administered via short form (SF), 
      computer adaptive test (CAT), and by mode of administration (computer vs. 
      paper-and-pencil). METHODS: Data are from two sources: an internet sample (N = 
      491) of daily and nondaily smokers who completed both SFs and CATs via the web 
      and a community sample (N = 369) that completed either paper-and-pencil or 
      computer administration of the SFs at two time points. First a CAT version of the 
      PROMIS Smoking Assessment Toolkit was evaluated by comparing item administration 
      rates and scores to the SF administration. Next, we considered the effect of 
      computer versus paper-and-pencil administration on scoring and test-retest 
      reliability. RESULTS: Across the domains approximately 5.4 to 10.3 items were 
      administered on average for the CAT. SF and CAT item response theory-scores were 
      correlated from 0.82 to 0.92 across the domains. Cronbach's alpha for the four- 
      to eight-item SFs among daily smokers ranged from .80 to .91 and .82 to .91 for 
      paper-and-pencil and computer administrations, respectively. Test-retest 
      reliability of the SFs ranged from 0.79 to 0.89 across mode of administration. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the SF and CAT and computer and 
      paper-and-pencil administrations provide highly comparable scores for daily and 
      nondaily smokers, but preference for SF or CAT administration may vary by smoking 
      domain.

TI  - Testing for polygenic effects in genome-wide association studies.
PG  - 306-16
LID - 10.1002/gepi.21899 [doi]
AB  - To confirm associations with a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs), each with only a small effect size, as hypothesized in the polygenic 
      theory for schizophrenia, the International Schizophrenia Consortium (2009, 
      Nature 460:748-752) proposed a polygenic risk score (PRS) test and demonstrated 
      its effectiveness when applied to psychiatric disorders. The basic idea of the 
      PRS test is to use a half of the sample to select and up-weight those more likely 
      to be associated SNPs, and then use the other half of the sample to test for 
      aggregated effects of the selected SNPs. Intrigued by the novelty and increasing 
      use of the PRS test, we aimed to evaluate and improve its performance for GWAS 
      data. First, by an analysis of the PRS test, we point out its connection with the 
      Sum test [Chapman and Whittaker, Genet Epidemiol 32:560-566; Pan, Genet Epidemiol 
      33:497-507]; given the known advantages and disadvantages of the Sum test, this 
      connection motivated the development of several other polygenic tests, some of 
      which may be more powerful than the PRS test under certain situations. Second, 
      more importantly, to overcome the low statistical efficiency of the 
      data-splitting strategy as adopted in the PRS test, we reformulate and thus 
      modify the PRS test, obtaining several adaptive tests, which are closely related 
      to the adaptive sum of powered score (SPU) test studied in the context of rare 
      variant analysis [Pan et al., 2014, Genetics 197:1081-1095]. We use both 
      simulated data and a real GWAS dataset of alcohol dependence to show dramatically 
      improved power of the new tests over the PRS test; due to its superior 
      performance and simplicity, we recommend the whole sample-based adaptive SPU test 
      for polygenic testing. We hope to raise the awareness of the limitations of the 
      PRS test and potential power gain of the adaptive SPU test.

TI  - Dutch-Flemish translation of nine pediatric item banks from the Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)(R).
PG  - 761-5
LID - 10.1007/s11136-015-0966-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R))) 
      is a new, state-of-the-art assessment system for measuring patient-reported 
      health and well-being of adults and children. It has the potential to be more 
      valid, reliable, and responsive than existing PROMs. The items banks are designed 
      to be self-reported and completed by children aged 8-18 years. The PROMIS items 
      can be administered in short forms or through computerized adaptive testing. This 
      paper describes the translation and cultural adaption of nine PROMIS item banks 
      (151 items) for children in Dutch-Flemish. METHODS: The translation was performed 
      by FACITtrans using standardized PROMIS methodology and approved by the PROMIS 
      Statistical Center. The translation included four forward translations, two 
      back-translations, three independent reviews (at least two Dutch, one Flemish), 
      and pretesting in 24 children from the Netherlands and Flanders. RESULTS: For 
      some items, it was necessary to have separate translations for Dutch and Flemish: 
      physical function-mobility (three items), anger (one item), pain interference 
      (two items), and asthma impact (one item). Challenges faced in the translation 
      process included scarcity or overabundance of possible translations, unclear item 
      descriptions, constructs broader/smaller in the target language, difficulties in 
      rank ordering items, differences in unit of measurement, irrelevant items, or 
      differences in performance of activities. By addressing these challenges, 
      acceptable translations were obtained for all items. CONCLUSION: The 
      Dutch-Flemish PROMIS items are linguistically equivalent to the original USA 
      version. Short forms are now available for use, and entire item banks are ready 
      for cross-cultural validation in the Netherlands and Flanders.

AB  - Depression and anxiety disorders are common conditions with significant 
      morbidity. Many screening tools of varying length have been well validated for 
      these conditions in the office-based setting. Novel instruments, including 
      Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, may be promising tools in the 
      future. The best evidence for cost-effectiveness currently is for screening of 
      major depression linked with the collaborative care model for treatment. Data are 
      not conclusive regarding comparative cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple 
      conditions at once or for other conditions. This article reviews screening tools 
      for depression and anxiety disorders in the ambulatory setting.

PG  - 1904-11

AB  - Vaccine benefit is usually two-folded: (i) prevent a disease or, failing that, 
      (ii) diminish the severity of a disease. To assess vaccine effect, we propose two 
      adaptive tests. The weighted two-part test is a combination of two statistics, 
      one on disease incidence and one on disease severity. More weight is given to the 
      statistic with the larger a priori effect size, and the weights are determined to 
      maximize testing power. The randomized test applies to the scenario where the 
      total number of infections is relatively small. It uses information on disease 
      severity to bolster power while preserving disease incidence as the primary 
      interest. Properties of the proposed tests are explored asymptotically and by 
      numerical studies. Although motivated by vaccine studies, the proposed tests 
      apply to any trials that involve both binary and continuous outcomes for 
      evaluating treatment effect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the psychometric properties of the 23-item version of the 
      Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-23) and to quantify their stability 
      across 2 cultures/languages and 2 types of care-settings. METHODS: Rasch analysis 
      of data from 1,000 patients with low back pain from primary care (UK and Denmark) 
      and secondary care (Denmark). RESULTS: The RMDQ-23 is unidimensional if local 
      item dependency issues are accommodated, but contains several misfitting or 
      overdiscriminating items, some poor targeting of items, and the scoring of 4-5 
      items is differentially affected by common clinical characteristics (such as age, 
      gender, pain intensity, pain duration and care setting), depending on the 
      country. CONCLUSION: As similar results have been found for the RMDQ-24, we 
      believe it is timely to reconsider whether: (i) the RMDQ should be reconstructed 
      using an item-response theory-based approach that includes consideration of new 
      items and response options; or (ii) the use of alternative questionnaires should 
      be recommended, such as the Oswestry Disability Index, that have shown evidence 
      of fitting the Rasch model; or (iii) a completely new condition-specific 
      questionnaire should be developed, perhaps utilizing a computerized adaptive 
      testing platform.

TI  - Utilizing Multidimensional Computer Adaptive Testing to Mitigate Burden With 
      Patient Reported Outcomes.
PG  - 320-8
AB  - Utilization of patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) had been limited by the 
      lack of psychometrically sound measures scored in real-time. The Patient Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative developed a broad 
      array of high-quality PRO measures. Towards reducing the number of items 
      administered in measuring PROs, PROMIS employs Item Response Theory (IRT) and 
      Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT). By only administering questions targeted to the 
      subject's trait level, CAT has cut testing times in half(1). The IRT/CAT 
      implementation in PROMIS is unidimensional in that there is a separate set of 
      questions administered for each measured trait. However, there are often 
      correlations among traits. Multidimensional IRT (MIRT) and multidimensional CAT 
      (MCAT) provide items concerning several correlated traits, and should ameliorate 
      patient burden. We developed an MIRT model using existing PROMIS item banks for 
      depression and anxiety, developed MCAT software, and compared the efficiency of 
      the MCAT approach to the unidimensional approach. Note: Research reported in this 
      publication was supported in part by the National Library of Medicine of the

TI  - Gaps between patients' reported current and preferred abilities versus 
      clinicians' emphases during an episode of care: any agreement?
PG  - 1137-43
LID - 10.1007/s11136-014-0888-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To be patient-centered, assessment must extract what patients prefer to 
      be able to do along with what they can do now so health care can specifically 
      address the gap between current and preferred abilities. In this project, we 
      compared patient-perceived current-preferred gaps with the assessments and 
      interventions reported by clinicians in a rehabilitation clinic. METHODS: 
      Sixty-two patients in outpatient physical therapy completed a computer-adaptive 
      test version of the patient-reported Movement Ability Measure (MAM-CAT) at 
      initial visit and discharge. The MAM-CAT calculated the gaps between the movement 
      patients perceived that they could do "Now" and what movement ability they "Would 
      Like" to have across six dimensions of movement: flexibility, strength, accuracy, 
      speed, adaptability, and endurance. Physical therapists' notes regarding 
      assessments and interventions were categorized based on these same six dimensions 
      of movement. Frequency of agreement between the largest patient-perceived gaps 
      and clinician-documented emphases was recorded (kappa analyses), along with 
      MAM-CAT changes at discharge (paired t tests). RESULTS: Although patient progress 
      was noted in both the MAM-CAT and the clinician notes (p < .05), comparison 
      showed poor or slight agreement (kappa < .05) between the specific movement 
      dimensions patients regarded as having the largest gaps and the dimensions on 
      which clinicians focused. CONCLUSION: The MAM-CAT facilitated direct comparison 
      of patients' current-preferred gaps at initiation and discharge with clinicians' 
      emphases during episodes of care. While interventions were perceived as 
      effective, collaboration between patients and clinicians using gap data could 
      increase alignment between patient priorities and clinician emphases, potentially 
      resulting in improved patient engagement and rehabilitative outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) based on Item Response Theory, 
      (IRT) offers an efficient way for accurate measurement of patient reported 
      outcomes. The efficiency lies within a minimal response burden and a high 
      measurement precision over a broad measurement range. The objective of the study 
      was to evaluate and compare the responsiveness of CATs measuring anxiety, 
      depression, and stress reaction to standard static self-assessment tools. 
      METHODS: Longitudinal data of n=595 psychosomatic inpatients were analyzed for 
      evaluating retest-reliability and sensitivity to change of the CATs compared to 
      static measures (GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PSQ) using correlational and ANOVA statistics. 
      The study hypothesized that CATs are at least as retest-reliable and as sensitive 
      to change as static tools. RESULTS: The three CATs show a low burden for 
      patients, administering on average 5-7 (+/-2-6SD) items with similar 
      retest-reliability compared to the static tools applied (A-CAT: r=.78 vs. GAD-7: 
      r=.75, D-CAT: r=.71 vs. PHQ-9: r=.75, S-CAT: r=.80 vs. PSQworries scale: r=.80). 
      The CATs were overall as sensitive to change as the static tools (Cohen׳s d 
      ranged between .19 and .69). LIMITATIONS: This is a monocenter, observational, 
      longitudinal study without external clinical criteria; thus generalization to 
      other settings may be limited. CONCLUSIONS: The tested CATs belong to the first 
      generation of CATs being used in daily routine for more than a decade. They are 
      as retest reliable and sensitive to change as static tools. Newer CATs may 
      provide further practical advantages.

TI  - Bringing PROMIS to practice: brief and precise symptom screening in ambulatory 
      cancer care.
PG  - 927-34
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supportive oncology practice can be enhanced by the integration of a 
      brief and validated electronic patient-reported outcome assessment into the 
      electronic health record (EHR) and clinical workflow. METHODS: Six hundred 
      thirty-six women receiving gynecologic oncology outpatient care received 
      instructions to complete clinical assessments through Epic MyChart, an EHR 
      patient communication portal. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests (CATs) were administered to assess 
      fatigue, pain interference, physical function, depression, and anxiety. 
      Checklists identified psychosocial concerns, informational and nutritional needs, 
      and risk factors for inadequate nutrition. Assessment results, including PROMIS T 
      scores with documented severity thresholds, were immediately populated in the 
      EHR. Clinicians were notified of clinically elevated symptoms through EHR 
      messages. EHR integration was designed to provide automated triage to social work 
      providers for psychosocial concerns, to health educators for information, and to 
      dietitians for nutrition-related concerns. RESULTS: Four thousand forty-two 
      MyChart messages sent, and 3203 (79%) were reviewed by patients. The assessment 
      was started by 1493 patients (37%), and once they started, 93% (1386 patients) 
      completed the assessment. According to first assessments only, 49.8% of the 
      patients who reviewed the MyChart message completed the assessment. Mean PROMIS 
      CAT T scores indicated a lower level of physical function and elevated anxiety in 
      comparison with the general population. Fatigue, pain, and depression scores were 
      comparable to those of the general population. Impaired physical functioning was 
      the most common basis for clinical alerts and occurred in 4% of the patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CATs were used to measure common cancer symptoms in routine 
      oncology outpatient care. Immediate EHR integration facilitated the use of 
      symptom reporting as the basis for referral to psychosocial and supportive care.

TI  - Standard Error of Ability Estimates and the Classification Accuracy and 
      Consistency of Binary Decisions.
PG  - 645-64
LID - 10.1007/s11336-014-9407-z [doi]
AB  - While estimation bias is a primary concern in psychological and educational 
      measurement, the standard error is of equal importance in linking key aspects of 
      the assessment structure, especially when the assessment goal concerns the 
      classification of individuals into categories (e.g., master/non-mastery). In this 
      paper, we show analytically how standard error of ability estimates affects 
      expected classification accuracy and consistency when the decision is binary. 
      When standard error decreases, the conditional classification accuracy and 
      consistency increase. Given an examinee population and a cut score, smaller 
      standard error over the entire latent trait continuum guarantees higher overall 
      expected classification accuracy and consistency. We were also able to show the 
      interrelationship between standard error, the expected classification 
      consistency, and reliability. Utilizing the relationship between standard error 
      and expected classification accuracy and consistency, we derive the upper bounds 
      of the overall expected classification accuracy and consistency of a fixed-length 
      computerized adaptive test. The lower bound of the expected classification 
      accuracy and consistency is also derived given a number of stopping rules of 
      variable-length computerized adaptive testing. Implications of these analytical 
      results on operational tests are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of surveys is becoming popular in the health care industry 
      for acquiring information useful to the accomplishment of several studies. 
      Besides their exploitation on a large scale for conducting epidemiological 
      studies, surveys are being increasingly carried out on a narrower perspective 
      through the administration of questionnaires aimed at assessing the quality of 
      life perceived by patients or their clinical status during mid- or long-term 
      treatments. This is useful for managing resources or optimizing and 
      individualizing treatments. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes Gquest, a platform 
      for modeling, generating and administering questionnaires through mobile devices 
      such as smartphones or tablets. Gquest was motivated by the need of administering 
      questionnaires during home treatments, albeit its applicability is rather 
      general. The main requirement was to have a very simple, clean and easy to use 
      platform able to support (a) physicians in the design and delivery of 
      questionnaires and (b) outpatients in sending self-recorded outcomes to the 
      clinical staff. METHODS: Gquest has two basic components. The first one is a 
      model devised for representing questionnaires which is extremely flexible. It 
      allows the generation of questions and answers of different types, supports 
      adaptivity in the dialog with the user and enforces simple consistency rules for 
      checking his input. The second component is an application able to run instances 
      of those questionnaires. It downloads questionnaires over the air in terms of XML 
      files from a server and stores them locally into the mobile repository. 
      Questionnaires become then available to the user, who in our case is a patient or 
      one of his relatives. The user can select which one to fill-in, according to his 
      needs and/or the specific treatment protocol. The selected questionnaire may be 
      filled-in all at once or be completed in subsequent steps over time since any 
      input provided is persisted on a local database. Finally, when a questionnaire is 
      closed all the answers are transparently synchronized to a server for further 
      evaluation or statistical purposes. RESULTS: The platform has been exploited and 
      tested in two medical domains where questionnaires have very different purposes; 
      a quality of life pilot survey involving patients with atrial fibrillation within 
      the EU-funded project MobiGuide, and an investigation of the users' needs during 
      the requirements elicitation phase of a telemedicine project for the safe 
      discharge of fragile patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gquest proved to be a suitable tool 
      for dealing with a wide variety of question types and has been positively 
      accepted by the patients enrolled in the pilot study.

TI  - Assessment of patient-reported symptoms of anxiety.
PG  - 197-211
AB  - Patient self-reported symptoms are of crucial importance to identify anxiety 
      disorders, as well as to monitor their treatment in clinical practice and 
      research. Thus, for evidence-based medicine, a precise, reliable, and valid (ie, 
      "objective") assessment of the patient's reported "subjective" symptoms is 
      warranted. There is a plethora of instruments available, which can provide 
      psychometrically sound assessments of anxiety, but there are several limitations 
      of current tools that need to be carefully considered for their successful use. 
      Nevertheless, the empirical assessment of mental health status is not as accepted 
      in medicine as is the assessment of biomarkers. One reason for this may be that 
      different instruments assessing the same psychological construct use different 
      scales. In this paper we present some new developments that promise to provide 
      one common metric for the assessment of anxiety, to facilitate the general 
      acceptance of mental health assessments in the future.

AB  - Depression and anxiety disorders are common conditions with significant 
      morbidity. Many screening tools of varying length have been well validated for 
      these conditions in the office-based setting. Novel instruments, including 
      Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, may be promising tools in the 
      future. The best evidence for cost-effectiveness currently is for screening of 
      major depression linked with the collaborative care model for treatment. Data are 
      not conclusive regarding comparative cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple 
      conditions at once or for other conditions. This article reviews screening tools 
      for depression and anxiety disorders in the ambulatory setting.

TI  - Development of the PROMIS Social Motivations for Smoking item banks.
PG  - S241-9
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntt283 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking behavior is influenced by social motivations such as the 
      expected social benefits of smoking and the social cues that induce craving. This 
      paper describes development of the PROMIS Social Motivations for Smoking item 
      banks, which will serve to standardize assessment of these social motivations 
      among daily and nondaily smokers. METHODS: Daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N 
      =1,183) smokers completed an online survey. Item factor analyses, item response 
      theory analyses, and differential item functioning analyses were conducted to 
      identify a unidimensional set of items for each group. Short forms (SFs) and 
      computer adaptive tests (CATs) were evaluated as tools for more efficiently 
      assessing this construct. RESULTS: A total of 15 items were included in the item 
      banks (9 items common to daily and nondaily smokers, 3 unique to daily, 3 unique 
      to nondaily). Scores based on full item banks are highly reliable (reliability = 
      0.90-0.91). Additionally, the item banks are strongly unidimensional and perform 
      similarly across gender, age, and race/ethnicity groups. A fixed SF for use with 
      both daily and nondaily smokers consists of 4 items (reliability = 0.80). Results 
      from simulated CATs showed that, on average, fewer than 5 items are needed to 
      assess this construct with adequate precision using the item banks. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A new set of items has been identified for assessing the social motivations for 
      smoking in a reliable, standardized manner for daily and nondaily smokers. In 
      addition to using the full item banks, efficient assessment can be achieved by 
      using SFs, employing CATs, or selecting items tailored to specific research or 
      clinical purposes.

PG  - S212-22
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntt281 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The positive emotional and sensory expectancies of cigarette 
      smoking include improved cognitive abilities, positive affective states, and 
      pleasurable sensorimotor sensations. This paper describes development of Positive 
      Emotional and Sensory Expectancies of Smoking item banks that will serve to 
      standardize the assessment of this construct among daily and nondaily cigarette 
      smokers. METHODS: Data came from daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N =1,183) 
      smokers who completed an online survey. To identify a unidimensional set of 
      items, we conducted item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and 
      differential item functioning analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the 
      performance of fixed-item short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive tests (CATs) to 
      efficiently assess the construct. RESULTS: Eighteen items were included in the 
      item banks (15 common across daily and nondaily smokers, 1 unique to daily, 2 
      unique to nondaily). The item banks are strongly unidimensional, highly reliable 
      (reliability = 0.95 for both), and perform similarly across gender, age, and 
      race/ethnicity groups. A SF common to daily and nondaily smokers consists of 6 
      items (reliability = 0.86). Results from simulated CATs indicated that, on 
      average, less than 8 items are needed to assess the construct with adequate 
      precision using the item banks. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses identified a new set 
      of items that can assess the positive emotional and sensory expectancies of 
      smoking in a reliable and standardized manner. Considerable efficiency in 
      assessing this construct can be achieved by using the item bank SF, employing 
      computer adaptive tests, or selecting subsets of items tailored to specific 
      research or clinical purposes.

TI  - Development of the PROMIS coping expectancies of smoking item banks.
PG  - S202-11
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntu040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Smoking is a coping strategy for many smokers who then have difficulty 
      finding new ways to cope with negative affect when they quit. This paper 
      describes analyses conducted to develop and evaluate item banks for assessing the 
      coping expectancies of smoking for daily and nondaily smokers. METHODS: Using 
      data from a large sample of daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N = 1,183) smokers, 
      we conducted a series of item factor analyses, item response theory analyses, and 
      differential item functioning (DIF) analyses (according to gender, age, and 
      ethnicity) to arrive at a unidimensional set of items for daily and nondaily 
      smokers. We also evaluated performance of short forms (SFs) and computer adaptive 
      tests (CATs) for assessing coping expectancies of smoking. RESULTS: For both 
      daily and nondaily smokers, the unidimensional Coping Expectancies item banks (21 
      items) are relatively DIF free and are highly reliable (0.96 and 0.97, 
      respectively). A common 4-item SF for daily and nondaily smokers also showed good 
      reliability (0.85). Adaptive tests required an average of 4.3 and 3.7 items for 
      simulated daily and nondaily respondents, respectively, and achieved 
      reliabilities of 0.91 for both when the maximum test length was 10 items. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This research provides a new set of items that can be used to 
      reliably assess coping expectancies of smoking, through a SF, CAT, or a tailored 
      set selected for a specific research purpose.

TI  - The PROMIS smoking assessment toolkit--background and introduction to supplement.
PG  - S170-4
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntu086 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The PROMIS Smoking Initiative has developed an assessment toolkit 
      for measuring 6 domains of interest to cigarette smoking research: nicotine 
      dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and sensory expectancies, health 
      expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social motivations for smoking. The 
      papers in this supplement describe the methods used to develop these item banks, 
      their psychometric properties, and the preliminary evidence for their validity. 
      This commentary is meant to provide background information for the material in 
      this supplement. METHODS: After discussing the use of item response theory in 
      behavioral measurement, I will briefly review the initial developmental steps for 
      the smoking assessment toolkit. Finally, I will describe the contents of this 
      supplement and provide some closing remarks. RESULTS: Psychometric evidence 
      strongly supports the utility of the toolkit of item banks, short forms (SFs), 
      and computer adaptive tests (CATs). The item banks for daily smokers produce 
      scores with reliability estimates above 0.90 for a wide range of each cigarette 
      smoking domain continuum, and SF and CAT administrations also achieve high 
      reliability (generally greater than 0.85) using very few items (4-7 items for 
      most banks). Performance of the banks for nondaily smokers is similar. 
      Preliminary evidence supports the concurrent and the discriminant validity of the 
      bank domains. CONCLUSIONS: The new smoking assessment toolkit has attractive 
      measurement features that are likely to benefit smoking research as researchers 
      begin to utilize this resource. Information about the toolkit and access to the 
      assessments is available at the project Web site 
      (http://www.rand.org/health/projects/promis-smoking-initiative.html) and can also 
      be accessed via the PROMIS Assessment Center (www.assessmentcenter.net).

      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) in a three-month observational study.

LID - S0022-3956(14)00148-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.05.010 [doi]
AB  - The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH 
      Roadmap initiative devoted to developing better measurement tools for assessing 
      constructs relevant to the clinical investigation and treatment of all 
      diseases-constructs such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, sleep, physical 
      functioning, and social participation. Following creation of item banks for these 
      constructs, our priority has been to validate them, most often in short-term 
      observational studies. We report here on a three-month prospective observational 
      study with depressed outpatients in the early stages of a new treatment episode 
      (with assessments at intake, one-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up). The 
      protocol was designed to compare the psychometric properties of the PROMIS 
      depression item bank (administered as a computerized adaptive test, CAT) with two 
      legacy self-report instruments: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
      scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer 
      et al., 1999). PROMIS depression demonstrated strong convergent validity with the 
      CESD and the PHQ-9 (with correlations in a range from .72 to .84 across all time 
      points), as well as responsiveness to change when characterizing symptom severity 
      in a clinical outpatient sample. Identification of patients as "recovered" varied 
      across the measures, with the PHQ-9 being the most conservative. The use of 
      calibrations based on models from item response theory (IRT) provides advantages 
      for PROMIS depression both psychometrically (creating the possibility of adaptive 
      testing, providing a broader effective range of measurement, and generating 
      greater precision) and practically (these psychometric advantages can be achieved 
      with fewer items-a median of 4 items administered by CAT-resulting in less 
      patient burden).

      chronic diseases through advanced statistical techniques (TRI) and computerized 
      adaptive testing (CAT). The aim of this study was to culturally adapt the Items 
      Banks of Anxiety and Depression of PROMIS to the Portuguese language. The process 
      followed the recommendations of PROMIS through the advanced translation, 
      reconciliation, back-translation, FACIT review, independent review, finalization, 
      pre-test, and incorporation of the results from the pre-test. The translated 
      version was pre-tested in ten patients, and items 3, 46, and 53 of the Bank of 
      Anxiety and item 46 of the bank of Depression had to be changed. Changes affected 
      equivalence of meaning, and the final version was consistent with the Brazilian 
      population's linguistic and cultural skills. In conclusion, for the Brazilian 
      population the translated version proved semantically and conceptually equivalent 
      to the original.

AB  - Existing sets of social and emotional stimuli suitable for social cognition 
      research are limited in many ways, including size, unimodal stimulus delivery, 
      and restriction to major universal emotions. Existing measures of social 
      cognition could be improved by taking advantage of item response theory and 
      adaptive testing technology to develop instruments that obtain more efficient 
      measures of multimodal social cognition. However, for this to be possible, large 
      pools of emotional stimuli must be obtained and validated. We present the 
      development of a large, high-quality multimedia stimulus set produced by 
      professional adult and child actors (ages 5 to 74) containing both visual and 
      vocal emotional expressions. We obtained over 74,000 audiovisual recordings of a 
      wide array of emotional and social behaviors, including the main universal 
      emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise), as well as 
      more complex social expressions (pride, affection, sarcasm, jealousy, and shame). 
      The actors generated a high quantity of technically superior, ecologically valid 
      stimuli that were digitized, archived, and rated for accuracy and intensity of 
      expressions. A subset of these facial and vocal expressions of emotion and social 
      behavior were submitted for quantitative ratings to generate parameters for 
      validity and discriminability. These stimuli are suitable for affective 
      neuroscience-based psychometric tests, functional neuroimaging, and social 
      cognitive rehabilitation programs. The purposes of this report are to describe 
      the method of obtaining and validating this database and to make it accessible to 
      the scientific community. We invite all those interested in participating in the 
      use and validation of these stimuli to access them at 
      www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/actors/index.shtml .

TI  - Psychometric properties for the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding: 
      dichotomous versus polytomous conventional and IRT scoring.
PG  - 878-91
LID - 10.1037/a0036430 [doi]
AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(3) of 
      Psychological Assessment (see record 2014-16017-001). The mean, standard 
      deviation and alpha coefficient originally reported in Table 1 should be 74.317, 
      10.214 and .802, respectively. The validity coefficients in the last column of 
      Table 4 are affected as well. Correcting this error did not change the 
      substantive interpretations of the results, but did increase the mean, standard 
      deviation, alpha coefficient, and validity coefficients reported for the Honesty 
      subscale in the text and in Tables 1 and 4. The corrected versions of Tables 1 
      and Table 4 are shown in the erratum.] Item response theory (IRT) models were 
      applied to dichotomous and polytomous scoring of the Self-Deceptive Enhancement 
      and Impression Management subscales of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable 
      Responding (Paulhus, 1991, 1999). Two dichotomous scoring methods reflecting 
      exaggerated endorsement and exaggerated denial of socially desirable behaviors 
      were examined. The 1- and 2-parameter logistic models (1PLM, 2PLM, respectively) 
      were applied to dichotomous responses, and the partial credit model (PCM) and 
      graded response model (GRM) were applied to polytomous responses. For both 
      subscales, the 2PLM fit dichotomous responses better than did the 1PLM, and the 
      GRM fit polytomous responses better than did the PCM. Polytomous GRM and raw 
      scores for both subscales yielded higher test-retest and convergent validity 
      coefficients than did PCM, 1PLM, 2PLM, and dichotomous raw scores. Information 
      plots showed that the GRM provided consistently high measurement precision that 
      was superior to that of all other IRT models over the full range of both 
      construct continuums. Dichotomous scores reflecting exaggerated endorsement of 
      socially desirable behaviors provided noticeably weak precision at low levels of 
      the construct continuums, calling into question the use of such scores for 
      detecting instances of "faking bad." Dichotomous models reflecting exaggerated 
      denial of the same behaviors yielded much better precision at low levels of the 
      constructs, but it was still less precision than that of the GRM. These results 
      support polytomous over dichotomous scoring in general, alternative dichotomous 
      scoring for detecting faking bad, and extension of GRM scoring to situations in 
      which IRT offers additional practical advantages over classical test theory 
      (adaptive testing, equating, linking, scaling, detecting differential item 
      functioning, and so forth).

TI  - Comparing CESD-10, PHQ-9, and PROMIS depression instruments in individuals with 
      multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 220-229
LID - 10.1037/a0035919 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated psychometric properties of the Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
      Scale-10 (CESD-10), and the 8-item PROMIS Depression Short Form (PROMIS-D-8; 8b 
      short form) in a sample of individuals living with multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      RESEARCH METHOD: Data were collected by a self-reported mailed survey of a 
      community sample of people living with MS (n = 455). Factor structure, interitem 
      reliability, convergent/discriminant validity and assignment to categories of 
      depression severity were examined. RESULTS: A 1-factor, confirmatory factor 
      analytic model had adequate fit for all instruments. Scores on the depression 
      scales were more highly correlated with one another than with scores on measures 
      of pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. The CESD-10 categorized about 37% of 
      participants as having significant depressive symptoms. At least moderate 
      depression was indicated for 24% of participants by PHQ-9. PROMIS-D-8 identified 
      19% of participants as having at least moderate depressive symptoms and about 7% 
      having at least moderately severe depression. None of the examined scales had 
      ceiling effects, but the PROMIS-D-8 had a floor effect. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 
      scores on all 3 scales demonstrated essential unidimensionality and had 
      acceptable interitem reliability and convergent/discriminant validity. 
      Researchers and clinicians can choose any of these scales to measure depressive 
      symptoms in individuals living with MS. The PHQ-9 offers validated cutoff scores 
      for diagnosing clinical depression. The PROMIS-D-8 measure minimizes the impact 
      of somatic features on the assessment of depression and allows for flexible 
      administration, including Computerize Adaptive Testing (CAT). The CESD-10 
      measures 2 aspects of depression, depressed mood and lack of positive affect, 
      while still providing an interpretable total score.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the ecological validity and clinical utility of 
      NIH Patient Reported-Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) 
      instruments for anger, depression, and fatigue in women with premenstrual 
      symptoms. METHODS: One-hundred women completed daily diaries and weekly PROMIS 
      assessments over 4weeks. Weekly assessments were administered through 
      Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). Weekly CATs and corresponding daily scores 
      were compared to evaluate ecological validity. To test clinical utility, we 
      examined if CATs could detect changes in symptom levels, if these changes 
      mirrored those obtained from daily scores, and if CATs could identify clinically 
      meaningful premenstrual symptom change. RESULTS: PROMIS CAT scores were higher in 
      the pre-menstrual than the baseline (ps<.0001) and post-menstrual (ps<.0001) 
      weeks. The correlations between CATs and aggregated daily scores ranged from .73 
      to .88 supporting ecological validity. Mean CAT scores showed systematic changes 
      in accordance with the menstrual cycle and the magnitudes of the changes were 
      similar to those obtained from the daily scores. Finally, Receiver Operating 
      Characteristic (ROC) analyses demonstrated the ability of the CATs to 
      discriminate between women with and without clinically meaningful premenstrual 
      symptom change. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CAT instruments for anger, depression, and 
      fatigue demonstrated validity and utility in premenstrual symptom assessment. The 
      results provide encouraging initial evidence of the utility of PROMIS instruments 
      for the measurement of affective premenstrual symptoms.

TI  - Comparing PROMIS computer-adaptive tests to the Brief Symptom Inventory in 
      patients with prostate cancer.
PG  - 2031-5
LID - 10.1007/s11136-014-0647-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study assessed whether the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) computer-adaptive tests (CATs) provided results 
      similar to those of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) with a low patient burden. 
      METHODS: Secondary data analysis of 136 prostate cancer patients who completed 
      the 53-item BSI and the PROMIS CATs assessing depression, anxiety, and hostility. 
      RESULTS: The PROMIS CATs and BSI correlated significantly in measures of 
      depression (.85), anxiety (.76), and anger/hostility (.66; p < .001 for all). 
      Using our BSI cutoff points for depression, anxiety, and anger/hostility, ROC 
      analysis yielded areas under the curve of .966 [standard error (SE) = .014, 
      p < .001], .975 (SE = .012, p < .001), and .952 (SE = .027, p < .001), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS CATs were highly correlated with the BSI 
      subscales, indicating that the CATs performed well compared with the BSI, a 
      widely used psychosocial measure.

TI  - New English and Spanish social health measures will facilitate evaluating health 
      determinants.
PG  - 490-9
LID - 10.1037/hea0000055 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop psychometrically sound, culturally relevant, and 
      linguistically equivalent English and Spanish self-report measures of social 
      health guided by a comprehensive conceptual model and applicable across chronic 
      illnesses. METHODS: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) Social Health Workgroup implemented a mixed methods approach to evaluate 
      earlier results (v1.0); expand and refine domain definitions and items; translate 
      items into Spanish; and obtain qualitative feedback. Computer-based and 
      paper/pencil questionnaire administration was conducted with a variety of U.S. 
      respondent samples during 2009-2012. Analyses included exploratory factor 
      analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), two-parameter logistic item 
      response theory (IRT) modeling, evaluation of differential item functioning 
      (DIF), and evaluation of criterion and construct validity. RESULTS: Qualitative 
      feedback supported the conceptualization of the Social Health domain framework 
      (Social Function and Social Relationships subcomponents). Validation testing 
      participants (n = 2,208 English; n = 644 Spanish) were diverse in terms of 
      gender, age, education, and ethnicity/race. EFA, CFA, and IRT identified 7 
      unidimensional factors with good model fit. There was no DIF by language, and 
      good evidence of criterion and construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS English 
      and Spanish language instruments (v2.0), including computer-adaptive tests and 
      fixed-length short forms, are publicly available for assessment of Social 
      Function (Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, and Satisfaction 
      with Social Roles and Activities) and Social Relationships (Companionship; 
      Emotional, Informational and Instrumental Support; and Social Isolation). 
      Measures of social health will play a key role in applications that use ecologic 
      (or determinants of health) models that emphasize how patients' social 
      environments influence their health.

TI  - Factors associated with incomplete DASH questionnaires.
PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1007/s11552-012-9480-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Missing data are unavoidable in clinical research. Older age, female 
      gender, and fewer years of education are risk factors for missing items in a 
      questionnaire. This study assessed the differences between patients with complete 
      and incomplete Disabilities of the Arms, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires 
      in terms of demographics and psychological factors. METHODS: We analyzed a 
      convenience sample of 1,204 patients enrolled in eight prospective studies. The 
      DASH and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were completed by all patients. The 
      Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, 
      Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, and an ordinal pain scale were completed by 745, 
      493, 545, and 391 patients, respectively. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic 
      regression were used to determine risk factors for incomplete (one or more 
      unanswered question) or invalid (more than three unanswered questions) DASH 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients did not complete all 
      questions on the DASH. Patients with an incomplete DASH were older, had fewer 
      years of education, and had higher levels of catastrophic thinking, depression, 
      and pain anxiety. Age and catastrophic thinking were retained in the best 
      logistic regression models of predictors of both incomplete and invalid DASH 
      questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that patients who complete 
      disability questionnaires are different from patients who do not may affect the 
      interpretation of clinical research. Computer adaptive testing may be preferable 
      to avoid incomplete questionnaires. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

TI  - Reducing survey burden: feasibility and validity of PROMIS measures in multiple 
      sclerosis.
PG  - 1102-11
LID - 10.1177/1352458513517279 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are important for clinical research and 
      care, yet administering and scoring the questionnaires requires considerable 
      effort and time. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) could considerably reduce administrative obstacles and lessen survey 
      burden for participants. OBJECTIVE: Assess the feasibility and validity of 
      PROMIS, compared to commonly-used legacy measures for multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 133 participants with confirmed MS 
      completed legacy surveys and PROMIS Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) for 
      depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue and physical function. We conducted a 
      multi-trait, multi-method analysis and verified results with confirmatory factor 
      analysis. RESULTS: The correlations between PROMIS and the corresponding legacy 
      measures were large (0.67 to 0.87). The multi-trait, multi-method criteria were 
      generally well met, providing good evidence of the validity of PROMIS measures. 
      PROMIS surveys asked fewer questions and required substantially less time to 
      complete than the legacy scales. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence of the 
      construct validity of PROMIS for use with MS patients. Several aspects of the 
      PROMIS CATs made them an important resource, including: (a) less time was 
      required to complete them; (b) missing data was reduced; and (c) the automatic 
      scoring referenced the general population. Our findings support the use of PROMIS 
      in MS research and may have broader implications for clinical care, as well.

TI  - Screening for mental disorders in heart failure patients using computer-adaptive 
      tests.
PG  - 1609-18
LID - 10.1007/s11136-013-0599-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Item response theory is increasingly used in the development of 
      psychometric tests. This paper evaluates whether these modern psychometric 
      methods can improve self-reported screening for depression and anxiety in 
      patients with heart failure. METHODS: The mental health status of 194 patients 
      with heart failure was assessed using six screening tools for depression (Patient 
      Health Questionnaire -9 (9 items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
      (7 items), PROMIS-Depression Short Form 8a (8 items)) and Anxiety (GAD-7 (7 
      items), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (7 items), PROMIS-Anxiety 
      Short Form 8a (8 items)). An in-person structured clinical interview was used as 
      the current gold standard to identify the presence of a mental disorder. The 
      diagnostic accuracy of all static tools was compared when item response theory 
      (IRT)-based person parameter were estimated instead of sum scores. Furthermore, 
      we compared performance of static instruments with post hoc simulated 
      individual-tailored computer-adaptive test (CATs) for both disorders and a common 
      negative affect CAT. RESULTS: In general, screening for depression was highly 
      efficient and showed a better performance than screening for anxiety with only 
      minimal differences among the assessed instruments. IRT-based person parameters 
      yielded the same diagnostic accuracy as sum scores. CATs showed similar screening 
      performance compared to legacy instruments but required significantly fewer items 
      to identify patients without mental conditions. Ideal cutoffs varied between male 
      and female samples. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the diagnostic performance of all 
      investigated instruments was similar, regardless of the methods being used. 
      However, CATs can individually tailor the test to each patient, thus 
      significantly decreasing the respondent burden for patients with and without 
      mental conditions. Such approach could efficiently increase the acceptability of 
      mental health screening in clinical practice settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) study were to (1) conceptualize children's subjective well-being 
      (SWB) and (2) produce item pools with excellent content validity for calibration 
      and use in computerized adaptive testings (CATs). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: 
      Children's SWB was defined through semistructured interviews with experts, 
      children (aged 8-17 years), parents, and a systematic literature review to 
      identify item concepts comprehensively covering the full spectrum of SWB. Item 
      concepts were transformed into item expressions and evaluated for 
      comprehensibility using cognitive interviews, reading level analysis, and 
      translatability review. RESULTS: Children's SWB comprises affective (positive 
      affect) and global evaluation components (life satisfaction). Input from experts, 
      children, parents, and the literature indicated that the eudaimonic dimension of 
      SWB-that is, a sense of meaning and purpose-could be evaluated. Item pools for 
      life satisfaction (56 items), positive affect (53 items), and meaning and purpose 
      (55 items) were produced. Small differences in comprehensibility of some items 
      were observed between children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: The SWB measures for 
      children are the first to assess both the hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of SWB. 
      Both children and youth seem to understand the concepts of a meaningful life, 
      optimism, and goal orientation.

TI  - The EORTC emotional functioning computerized adaptive test: phases I-III of a 
      cross-cultural item bank development.
PG  - 397-403
LID - 10.1002/pon.3427 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
      (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is currently developing computerized adaptive 
      testing measures for the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) scales. 
      The work presented here describes the development of an EORTC item bank for 
      emotional functioning (EF), which is one of the core domains of the QLQ-C30. 
      METHODS: According to the EORTC guidelines on module development, the development 
      of the EF item bank comprised four phases, of which the phases I-III are reported 
      in the present paper. Phase I involved defining the theoretical framework for the 
      EF item bank and a literature search. Phase II included pre-defined item 
      selection steps and a multi-stage expert review process. In phase III, feedback 
      from cancer patients from different countries was obtained. RESULTS: On the basis 
      of literature search in phase I, a list of 1750 items was generated. These were 
      reviewed and further developed in phase II with a focus on relevance, redundancy, 
      clarity, and difficulty. The development and selection steps led to a preliminary 
      list of 41 items. In phase III, patient interviews (N = 41; Austria, Denmark, 
      Italy, and the UK) were conducted with the preliminary item list, resulting in 
      some minor changes to item wording. The final list comprised 38 items. 
      DISCUSSION: The phases I-III of the developmental process have resulted in an EF 
      item list that was well accepted by patients in several countries. The items will 
      be subjected to larger-scale field testing in order to establish their 
      psychometric characteristics and their fit to an item response theory model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plantar heel pain syndrome (PHPS) is a common foot disorder; however, 
      there is limited clinical evidence on which to base treatment. Repeated clinical 
      observations indicating heel pain during heel rise and minisquat on the affected 
      leg, involving activation of posterior calf muscles, formed the basis of this 
      study. OBJECTIVE: To compare deep massage therapy to posterior calf muscles and 
      neural mobilization with a self-stretch exercise program (DMS) to a common 
      treatment protocol of ultrasound therapy to the painful heel area with the same 
      self-stretch exercises (USS). METHODS: Patients with PHPS were assigned to a 
      program of 8 treatments over a period of 4-6 weeks in a single-blind randomized 
      clinical trial. Functional status (FS) at admission and discharge from therapy as 
      measured by the Foot & Ankle Computerized Adaptive Test was the main outcome 
      measure. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included in the trial (mean age 53, 
      standard deviation (SD) 13, range 25-86, 57% women), 36 received DMS treatment 
      and 33 with USS. The overall group-by-time interaction for the mixed-model 
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) was found statistically significant (p=0.034), with 
      a change of (mean (confidence interval, CI)) 15 (9-21) and 6 (1-11) FS points for 
      the DMS and USS groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Data indicated that both 
      treatment protocols resulted in an overall short-term improvement, however, DMS 
      treatment was significantly more effective in treating PHPS than USS treatment.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the PROMIS (R) pediatric scales: precision, stability, 
      and comparison of different scoring and administration options.
PG  - 1233-43
LID - 10.1007/s11136-013-0544-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study are to investigate the precision 
      of static (fixed-length) short forms versus computerized adaptive testing (CAT) 
      administration, response pattern scoring versus summed score conversion, and 
      test-retest reliability (stability) of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS((R))) pediatric self-report scales measuring the latent 
      constructs of depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, pain interference, peer 
      relationships, fatigue, mobility, upper extremity functioning, and asthma impact 
      with polytomous items. METHODS: Participants (N = 331) between the ages of 8 and 
      17 were recruited from outpatient general pediatrics and subspecialty clinics. Of 
      the 331 participants, 137 were diagnosed with asthma. Three scores based on item 
      response theory (IRT) were computed for each respondent: CAT response pattern 
      expected a posteriori estimates, short-form response pattern expected a 
      posteriori estimates, and short-form summed score expected a posteriori 
      estimates. Scores were also compared between participants with and without 
      asthma. To examine test-retest reliability, 54 children were selected for 
      retesting approximately 2 weeks after the first assessment. RESULTS: A short CAT 
      (maximum 12 items with a standard error of 0.4) was found, on average, to be less 
      precise than the static short forms. The CAT appears to have limited usefulness 
      over and above what can be accomplished with the existing static short forms 
      (8-10 items). Stability of the scale scores over a 2-week period was generally 
      supported. CONCLUSION: The study provides further information on the psychometric 
      properties of the PROMIS pediatric scales and extends the previous IRT analyses 
      to include precision estimates of dynamic versus static administration, 
      test-retest reliability, and validity of administration across groups. Both the 
      positive and negative aspects of using CAT versus short forms are highlighted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe whether negative affect and sleep impairment are 
      associated with the clinical effect of epidural steroid injections (ESIs) for low 
      back pain. DESIGN: Observational study; patients were evaluated before ESI and 1 
      and 3 months after ESI. SETTING: Spine center and related treatment sites. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=158) seeking treatment for low back pain with or 
      without radiculopathy. INTERVENTION: ESI for low back pain with or without 
      radiculopathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the dependent (global pain 
      severity for back and leg pain, pain behavior, pain interference) and independent 
      variables (depression, sleep disturbance, and covariates of back pain response) 
      with the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and 
      legacy measures. Outcome was assessed cross-sectionally using multiple regression 
      and longitudinally with path analysis. RESULTS: After 1 month, sleep disturbance 
      was the only predictor for the global ratings of improvement in back pain 
      (R(2)=16.8%) and leg pain (R(2)=11.4%). The proportions of variance explained by 
      sleep disturbance and negative affect for all dependent variables were greater at 
      3 months than 1 month. Mediation analysis was significant for negative affect for 
      the 3-month outcomes on PROMIS pain behavior (beta=.87, P<.01) and pain interference 
      (beta=.37, P<.01). There was no evidence of mediation by sleep disturbance for any 
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect and sleep disturbance are associated with 
      worse outcomes after ESI. Further research is needed to determine if treatment of 
      negative affect and sleep disturbance prior to or concurrently with ESI will 
      improve outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of symptom intensity, mood, and comorbidities 
      on patient-clinician agreement and the consistency of responses to functional 
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs). DESIGN: Two data sources were used. The first, 
      a cross-sectional database of patients with breast cancer who completed 
      functional PROs and were administered the FIM, was used to examine whether 
      average pain intensity (as measured with an 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) 
      and Rand Mental Health inventory scores differed among those rating their 
      functional independence as different than clinicians. The second, a longitudinal 
      database of 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer who completed the Activity 
      Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM PAC CAT) with differences 
      between their expected and actual responses as reflected in their AM PAC CAT SEs. 
      SETTING: Two tertiary medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Data source #1, 163 women 
      with stage IV breast cancer; data source #2, 311 adults with late-stage lung 
      cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data source #1, 
      FIM, pain NRS, Older Americans Resource Study activities of daily living 
      subscale, Physical Function-10, Mental Health Inventory-17. Data source #2, AM 
      PAC CAT and NRS symptom ratings. RESULTS: Pain intensity was significantly higher 
      when clinicians and patients disagreed regarding a patient's independence in the 
      ability to transfer (NRS pain severity, 3.78 vs 2.40; P=.014), groom (3.71 vs 
      2.36, P=.009), bathe (3.76 vs 2.40, P=.016), and dress (3.09 vs 2.44, P=.034). 
      The magnitude of AM PAC CAT SEs was significantly associated with the severity of 
      participants' pain, dyspnea, and fatigue, as well as the presence of 
      musculoskeletal disorders and coronary artery disease. Neither mood nor emotional 
      distress was associated with clinician-patient agreement or AM PAC CAT SE. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pain intensity is associated with disagreement between patients and 
      clinicians about the patient's level of functioning. Moreover, physical symptoms 
      (pain, dyspnea, fatigue) as well as specific medical comorbidities 
      (musculoskeletal disorders, coronary artery disease), but not mood, are 
      associated with inconsistency in patients' assessment of their functional 
      abilities.

TI  - Methodology for developing and evaluating the PROMIS smoking item banks.
PG  - S175-89
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntt123 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article describes the procedures used in the PROMIS Smoking 
      Initiative for the development and evaluation of item banks, short forms (SFs), 
      and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for the assessment of 6 constructs related 
      to cigarette smoking: nicotine dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and 
      sensory expectancies, health expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social 
      motivations for smoking. METHODS: Analyses were conducted using response data 
      from a large national sample of smokers. Items related to each construct were 
      subjected to extensive item factor analyses and evaluation of differential item 
      functioning (DIF). Final item banks were calibrated, and SF assessments were 
      developed for each construct. The performance of the SFs and the potential use of 
      the item banks for CAT administration were examined through simulation study. 
      RESULTS: Item selection based on dimensionality assessment and DIF analyses 
      produced item banks that were essentially unidimensional in structure and free of 
      bias. Simulation studies demonstrated that the constructs could be accurately 
      measured with a relatively small number of carefully selected items, either 
      through fixed SFs or CAT-based assessment. Illustrative results are presented, 
      and subsequent articles provide detailed discussion of each item bank in turn. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The development of the PROMIS smoking item banks provides 
      researchers with new tools for measuring smoking-related constructs. The use of 
      the calibrated item banks and suggested SF assessments will enhance the quality 
      of score estimates, thus advancing smoking research. Moreover, the methods used 
      in the current study, including innovative approaches to item selection and SF 
      construction, may have general relevance to item bank development and evaluation.

PG  - 187-94
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020178 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors developed a computerized adaptive test for anxiety that 
      decreases patient and clinician burden and increases measurement precision. 
      METHOD: A total of 1,614 individuals with and without generalized anxiety 
      disorder from a psychiatric clinic and community mental health center were 
      recruited. The focus of the present study was the development of the Computerized 
      Adaptive Testing-Anxiety Inventory (CAT-ANX). The Structured Clinical Interview 
      for DSM-IV was used to obtain diagnostic classifications of generalized anxiety 
      disorder and major depressive disorder. RESULTS: An average of 12 items per 
      subject was required to achieve a 0.3 standard error in the anxiety severity 
      estimate and maintain a correlation of 0.94 with the total 431-item test score. 
      CAT-ANX scores were strongly related to the probability of a generalized anxiety 
      disorder diagnosis. Using both the Computerized Adaptive Testing-Depression 
      Inventory and the CAT-ANX, comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized 
      anxiety disorder can be accurately predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional 
      measurement fixes the number of items but allows measurement uncertainty to vary. 
      Computerized adaptive testing fixes measurement uncertainty and allows the number 
      and content of items to vary, leading to a dramatic decrease in the number of 
      items required for a fixed level of measurement uncertainty. Potential 
      applications for inexpensive, efficient, and accurate screening of anxiety in 
      primary care settings, clinical trials, psychiatric epidemiology, molecular 
      genetics, children, and other cultures are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a computer adaptive test for the assessment of 
      anxiety in cardiovascular rehabilitation patients (ACAT-cardio) that tailors an 
      optimal test for each patient and enables precise and time-effective measurement. 
      DESIGN: Simulation study, validation study (against the anxiety subscale of the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the physical component summary scale of 
      the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey), and longitudinal study (beginning and end 
      of rehabilitation). SETTING: Cardiac rehabilitation centers. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Cardiovascular rehabilitation patients: simulation study sample (n=106; mean age, 
      57.8y; 25.5% women) and validation and longitudinal study sample (n=138; mean 
      age, 58.6 and 57.9y, respectively; 16.7% and 12.1% women, respectively). 
      INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale, 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and ACAT-cardio. RESULTS: The 
      mean number of items was 9.2 with an average processing time of 1:13 minutes when 
      an SE </=.50 was used as a stopping rule; with an SE </=.32, there were 28 items and 
      a processing time of 3:47 minutes. Validity could be confirmed via correlations 
      between .68 and .81 concerning convergent validity (ACAT-cardio vs Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale) and correlations between -.47 and 
      -.30 concerning discriminant validity (ACAT-cardio vs 12-Item Short-Form Health 
      Survey physical component summary scale). Sensitivity to change was moderate to 
      high with standardized response means between .45 and .82. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ACAT-cardio shows good psychometric properties and provides the opportunity for 
      an innovative and time-effective assessment of anxiety in cardiovascular 
      rehabilitation. A more flexible stopping rule might further improve the 
      ACAT-cardio. Additionally, testing in other cardiovascular populations would 
      increase generalizability.

TI  - Bifactor item response theory model of acute stress response.
PG  - e65291
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0065291 [doi]
LID - e65291
AB  - BACKGROUND: Better understanding of acute stress responses is important for 
      revision of DSM-5. However, the latent structure and relationship between 
      different aspects of acute stress responses haven't been clarified 
      comprehensively. Bifactor item response model may help resolve this problem. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop a statistical model of acute 
      stress responses, based on data from earthquake rescuers using Acute Stress 
      Response Scale (ASRS). Through this model, we could better understand acute 
      stress responses comprehensively, and provide preliminary information for 
      computerized adaptive testing of stress responses. METHODS: Acute stress 
      responses of earthquake rescuers were evaluated using ASRS, and state/trait 
      anxiety were assessed using State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). A hierarchical 
      item response model (bifactor model) was used to analyze the data. Additionally, 
      we tested this hierarchical model with model fit comparisons with one-dimensional 
      and five-dimensional models. The correlations among acute stress responses and 
      state/trait anxiety were compared, based on both the five-dimensional and 
      bifactor models. RESULTS: Model fit comparisons showed bifactor model fit the 
      data best. Item loadings on general and specific factors varied greatly between 
      different aspects of stress responses. Many symptoms (40%) of physiological 
      responses had positive loadings on general factor, and negative loadings on 
      specific factor of physiological responses, while other stress responses had 
      positive loadings on both general and specific factors. After extracting general 
      factor of stress responses using bifactor analysis, significant positive 
      correlations between physiological responses and state/trait anxiety 
      (r = 0.185/0.112, p<0.01) changed into negative ones (r = -0.177/-0.38, p<0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated bifactor structure of acute stress 
      responses, and positive and negative correlations between physiological responses 
      and stress responses suggested physiological responses could have negative 
      feedback on severity of stress responses. This finding has not been convincingly 
      demonstrated in previous research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a paper-and-pencil semi-adaptive test for 5 domains of 
      health-related quality of life (PAT-5D-QOL) based on item response theory (IRT). 
      METHODS: The questionnaire uses items from previously developed item banks for 5 
      domains: (1) walking, (2) handling objects, (3) daily activities, (4) pain or 
      discomfort, and (5) feelings. For each domain, respondents are initially 
      classified into 4 functional levels. Depending on the level, they are instructed 
      to respond to a different set of 5 additional questions. IRT scores for each 
      domain and overall health utility scores are obtained using a simple spreadsheet. 
      The questions were selected using psychometric and conceptual criteria. The 
      format of the questionnaire was developed through focus groups and cognitive 
      interviews. Feasibility was tested in two population surveys. A simulation study 
      was conducted to compare PAT-5D-QOL with a computerized adaptive test 
      (CAT-5D-QOL) and a fixed questionnaire, developed from the same item banks, in 
      terms of accuracy, bias, precision, and ceiling and floor effects. RESULTS: Close 
      to 90 % of the participants in feasibility studies followed the skip instructions 
      properly. In a simulation study, scores on PAT-5D-QOL for all domains tended to 
      be more accurate, more precise, less biased, and less affected by a ceiling 
      effect than scores on a fixed IRT-based questionnaire of the same length. 
      PAT-5D-QOL was slightly inferior to a fully adaptive instrument. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PAT-5D-QOL is a novel, semi-adaptive, IRT-based measure of health-related quality 
      of life with a broad range of potential applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computer adaptive tests (CATs) offer a flexible, test fair, and 
      economic opportunity for accurate measurement of anxiety in patients with 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The objective of this study was to develop and 
      calibrate an item bank [anxiety item bank for cardiovascular patients 
      (AIB-cardio)] as a prerequisite for an anxiety-CAT in CVD patients. STUDY DESIGN 
      AND SETTING: After pretesting for relevance and comprehension, a pool of 155 
      anxiety items was answered on a five-point Likert scale. Sample consisted of 715 
      CVD patients, who were recruited in 14 German cardiac rehabilitation centers. A 
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Mokken analysis, and Rasch analysis were 
      conducted. RESULTS: The results of CFA and Mokken analysis confirmed one factor 
      structure and double monotonicity. In Rasch analysis, merging response categories 
      and removing items with misfit, differential item functioning or local response 
      dependency reduced the AIB-cardio to 37 items. The AIB-cardio fitted to the Rasch 
      model with a nonsignificant item-trait interaction (chi-square, 133.89; degrees 
      of freedom, 111; P = 0.07). Person separation reliability was 0.85, and 
      unidimensionality could be verified. CONCLUSION: The calibrated, unidimensional 
      AIB-cardio provides the basis for a CAT to assess anxiety in rehabilitation 
      patients with CVD with good psychometric properties. Further testing in other 
      cardiovascular patients is needed to increase generalizability.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a broad set of claimant-reported items to assess 
      behavioral health functioning relevant to the Social Security disability 
      determination processes, and to evaluate the underlying structure of behavioral 
      health functioning for use in development of a new functional assessment 
      instrument. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Item pools 
      of behavioral health functioning were developed, refined, and field tested in a 
      sample of persons applying for Social Security disability benefits (N=1015) who 
      reported difficulties working because of mental or both mental and physical 
      conditions. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Social Security 
      Administration Behavioral Health (SSA-BH) measurement instrument. RESULTS: 
      Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) specified that a 4-factor model 
      (self-efficacy, mood and emotions, behavioral control, social interactions) had 
      the optimal fit with the data and was also consistent with our hypothesized 
      conceptual framework for characterizing behavioral health functioning. When the 
      items within each of the 4 scales were tested in CFA, the fit statistics 
      indicated adequate support for characterizing behavioral health as a 
      unidimensional construct along these 4 distinct scales of function. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This work represents a significant advance both conceptually and psychometrically 
      in assessment methodologies for work-related behavioral health. The measurement 
      of behavioral health functioning relevant to the context of work requires the 
      assessment of multiple dimensions of behavioral health functioning. Specifically, 
      we identified a 4-factor model solution that represented key domains of 
      work-related behavioral health functioning. These results guided the development 
      and scale formation of a new SSA-BH instrument.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use item response theory (IRT) data simulations to construct and 
      perform initial psychometric testing of a newly developed instrument, the Social 
      Security Administration Behavioral Health Function (SSA-BH) instrument, that aims 
      to assess behavioral health functioning relevant to the context of work. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey followed by IRT calibration data simulations. SETTING: 
      Community. PARTICIPANTS: Sample of individuals applying for Social Security 
      Administration disability benefits: claimants (n=1015) and a normative 
      comparative sample of U.S. adults (n=1000). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: SSA-BH measurement instrument. RESULTS: IRT analyses supported the 
      unidimensionality of 4 SSA-BH scales: mood and emotions (35 items), self-efficacy 
      (23 items), social interactions (6 items), and behavioral control (15 items). All 
      SSA-BH scales demonstrated strong psychometric properties including reliability, 
      accuracy, and breadth of coverage. High correlations of the simulated 5- or 
      10-item computer adaptive tests with the full item bank indicated robust ability 
      of the computer adaptive testing approach to comprehensively characterize 
      behavioral health function along 4 distinct dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Initial 
      testing and evaluation of the SSA-BH instrument demonstrated good accuracy, 
      reliability, and content coverage along all 4 scales. Behavioral function 
      profiles of Social Security Administration claimants were generated and compared 
      with age- and sex-matched norms along 4 scales: mood and emotions, behavioral 
      control, social interactions, and self-efficacy. Using the computer adaptive 
      test-based approach offers the ability to collect standardized, comprehensive 
      functional information about claimants in an efficient way, which may prove 
      useful in the context of the Social Security Administration's work disability 
      programs.

AB  - The American College of Surgeons (ACoS) Commission on Cancer (CoC) has advanced a 
      new patient-centered accreditation standard requiring programs to implement 
      psychosocial distress screening and referral for psychosocial care. The field of 
      psychosocial oncology has advocated for routine distress screening as an integral 
      component of quality cancer care since the NCCN Distress Management Panel first 
      recommended this practice in 1999. Accreditation standards have a significant 
      impact on practice patterns and quality of care. The new ACoS CoC Psychosocial 
      Distress Screening Standard provides a unique opportunity to integrate the 
      science of psychosocial care into clinical practice. National organizations, 
      including the American Psychosocial Oncology Society, the Association of Oncology 
      Social Work, the Cancer Support Community, and LIVESTRONG, can offer valuable 
      guidance and resources. This article reviews ACoS CoC requirements, highlighting 
      key research findings and providing practical considerations to guide programs 
      with implementation. Although screening for distress encompasses many domains, 
      this article reviews the evidence linking depression-one aspect of distress-and 
      cancer outcomes to highlight the profound influence psychosocial care delivery 
      can have on promoting medical outcomes and quality cancer survivorship. The 
      authors describe distress screening program accomplishments at Northwestern 
      University, including the electronic administration of NIH Patient Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive testing item banks. 
      Electronic medical record integration facilitates real-time scoring, 
      interpretation, provider notification, and triage for psychosocial care. Roughly 
      one-third of patients have requested assistance with psychosocial needs. As ACoS 
      CoC programs implement psychosocial distress screening and management, the 
      emerging field of implementation science can guide future clinical program 
      developments and research priorities.

AB  - We report on the selection of self-report measures for inclusion in the NIH 
      Toolbox that are suitable for assessing the full range of negative affect 
      including sadness, fear, and anger. The Toolbox is intended to serve as a "core 
      battery" of assessment tools for cognition, sensation, motor function, and 
      emotional health that will help to overcome the lack of consistency in measures 
      used across epidemiological, observational, and intervention studies. A secondary 
      goal of the NIH Toolbox is the identification of measures that are flexible, 
      efficient, and precise, an agenda best fulfilled by the use of item banks 
      calibrated with models from item response theory (IRT) and suitable for adaptive 
      testing. Results from a sample of 1763 respondents supported use of the adult and 
      pediatric item banks for emotional distress from the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R))) as a starting point for capturing the 
      full range of negative affect in healthy individuals. Content coverage for the 
      adult Toolbox was also enhanced by the development of a scale for somatic arousal 
      using items from the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) and scales for 
      hostility and physical aggression using items from the Buss-Perry Aggression 
      Questionnaire (BPAQ).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Computer Adaptive Test version of the Community Reintegration of 
      Injured Service Members measure (CRIS-CAT) consists of three scales measuring 
      Extent of, Perceived Limitations in, and Satisfaction with community integration. 
      The CRIS-CAT was developed using item response theory methods. The purposes of 
      this study were to assess the reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive 
      validity and respondent burden of the CRIS-CAT.The CRIS-CAT was developed using 
      item response theory methods. The purposes of this study were to assess the 
      reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive validity and respondent 
      burden of the CRIS-CAT. METHODS: This was a three-part study that included a 1) a 
      cross-sectional field study of 517 homeless, employed, and Operation Enduring 
      Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans; who completed all items in 
      the CRIS item set, 2) a cohort study with one year follow-up study of 135 OEF/OIF 
      Veterans, and 3) a 50-person study of CRIS-CAT administration. Conditional 
      reliability of simulated CAT scores was calculated from the field study data, and 
      concurrent validity and known group validity were examined using Pearson product 
      correlations and ANOVAs. Data from the cohort were used to examine the ability of 
      the CRIS-CAT to predict key one year outcomes. Data from the CRIS-CAT 
      administration study were used to calculate ICC (2,1) minimum detectable change 
      (MDC), and average number of items used during CAT administration. RESULTS: 
      Reliability scores for all scales were above 0.75, but decreased at both ends of 
      the score continuum. CRIS-CAT scores were correlated with concurrent validity 
      indicators and differed significantly between the three Veteran groups (P < 
      .001). The odds of having any Emergency Room visits were reduced for Veterans 
      with better CRIS-CAT scores (Extent, Perceived Satisfaction respectively: OR = 
      0.94, 0.93, 0.95; P < .05). CRIS-CAT scores were predictive of SF-12 physical and 
      mental health related quality of life scores at the 1 year follow-up. Scales had 
      ICCs >0.9. MDCs were 5.9, 6.2, and 3.6, respectively for Extent, Perceived and 
      Satisfaction subscales. Number of items (mn, SD) administered at Visit 1 were 
      14.6 (3.8) 10.9 (2.7) and 10.4 (1.7) respectively for Extent, Perceived and 
      Satisfaction subscales. CONCLUSION: The CRIS-CAT demonstrated sound measurement 
      properties including reliability, construct, known group and predictive validity, 
      and it was administered with minimal respondent burden. These findings support 
      the use of this measure in assessing community reintegration.

TI  - Influence of fear-avoidance beliefs on functional status outcomes for people with 
      musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder.
PG  - 992-1005
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20110309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of elevated fear-avoidance beliefs on change in 
      functional status is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      determine the influence of fear-avoidance on recovery of functional status during 
      rehabilitation for people with shoulder impairments. DESIGN: A retrospective 
      longitudinal cohort study was conducted. METHODS: Data were collected from 3,362 
      people with musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder receiving rehabilitation. 
      At intake and discharge, upper-extremity function was measured using the shoulder 
      Computerized Adaptive Test. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point 
      numerical rating scale. Completion rate at discharge was 57% for function and 47% 
      for pain intensity. A single-item screen was used to classify patients into 
      groups with low versus elevated fear-avoidance beliefs at intake. A general 
      linear model (GLM) was used to describe how change in function is affected by 
      fear avoidance in 8 disease categories. This study also accounted for 
      within-clinic correlation and controlled for other important predictors of 
      functional change in functional status, including various demographic and 
      health-related variables. The parameters of the GLM and their standard errors 
      were estimated with the weighted generalized estimating equations method. 
      RESULTS: Functional change was predicted by the interaction between fear and 
      disease categories. On further examination of 8 disease categories using GLM 
      adjusted for other confounders, improvement in function was greater for the low 
      fear group than for the elevated fear group among people with muscle, tendon, and 
      soft tissue disorders (Delta=1.37, P<.01) and those with osteopathies, 
      chondropathies, and acquired musculoskeletal deformities (Delta=5.52, P<.02). These 
      differences were below the minimal detectable change. Limitations Information was 
      not available on whether therapists used information on level of fear to 
      implement treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of fear-avoidance beliefs 
      on change in functional status varies among specific shoulder impairments.

AB  - DYNHA SF-36 is a computerized adaptive test version of the SF-36 Health Survey. 
      The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was 
      evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N=100) and 
      Internet consumer health panel members (N=101). Participants completed the DYNHA 
      SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role 
      function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), 
      general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and 
      scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), 
      Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, 
      precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher 
      percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. 
      For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90% 
      reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of 
      measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the 
      Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet 
      participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF 
      scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and 
      BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The 
      measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet 
      respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has 
      promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic 
      setting and through telemonitoring.

TI  - Application of the National Institutes of Health Patient-reported Outcome 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to mental health research.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      is a National Institutes of Health initiative to develop item banks measuring 
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and to create and make available a computerized 
      adaptive testing system (CAT) that allows for efficient and precise assessment of 
      PROs in clinical research and practice. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This paper provides an 
      overview of PROMIS and its application to mental health research. METHODS: The 
      PROMIS methodology for item bank development and testing is described, with a 
      focus on the implications of this work for mental health research. RESULTS: 
      Utilizing qualitative item review and state-of-the-art applications of item 
      response theory (IRT), PROMIS investigators have developed, tested, and released 
      item banks measuring physical, mental, and social health components. Ongoing 
      efforts continue to add new item banks and further validate existing banks. 
      DISCUSSION: PROMIS provides item banks measuring several domains of interest to 
      mental health researchers including emotional distress, social function, and 
      sleep. PROMIS methodology also provides a rigorous standard for the development 
      of new mental health measures. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION: Web-based 
      CAT or administration of short forms derived from PROMIS item banks provide 
      efficient and precise dimensional estimates of clinical outcomes that can be 
      utilized to monitor patient progress and assess quality improvement. IMPLICATIONS 
      FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Use of the dimensional PROMIS metrics (and co-calibration of 
      the PROMIS item banks with existing PROs) will allow comparisons of mental health 
      and related health outcomes across disorders and studies.

TI  - Measuring quality of life in patients with schizophrenia: an update.
PG  - 183-95
LID - 10.2165/11594470-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - In 1997, we published a review in PharmacoEconomics about quality of life (QOL) 
      measurement in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this article is to 
      provide an update, as well as to revisit the development of the construct of QOL 
      and its measurement as applied to schizophrenia. Since our previous article, 
      there has been significant growth in the number of publications about QOL in 
      schizophrenia. Unfortunately, alongside this significant increase in research 
      interest, a number of concerns have also risen about the limitations and lack of 
      impact the concept of QOL has on clinical care and health-policy decision making. 
      A number of concerns previously outlined (such as lack of consensus on a uniform 
      definition of QOL) continue to be an issue. However, we believe that a uniform 
      definition may not be possible, and instead, it may be preferable to have several 
      definitions, which may enrich the concept and broaden its usefulness. Some of the 
      scales we reviewed in 1997 continue to be in use, while others are now rarely or 
      never used. New scales with better psychometrics have been introduced, but most 
      are without theoretical or conceptual foundation. On the other hand, the field of 
      scaling in general has been changing over the past few years and is moving 
      towards a new approach for scale development, based on item response theory, item 
      banks and computer adaptive testing. Unfortunately, this has not extended to QOL 
      in schizophrenia. There continues to be a dearth of theoretical and conceptual 
      models for QOL in schizophrenia, which seems to create the perception that the 
      construct lacks a good theoretical and scientific foundation. One of the major 
      gaps identified in this review is the recognized lack of impact of QOL 
      measurements on clinical management or policy decision making. The majority of 
      publications continue to focus on measurement rather than what to do with the 
      data. The lack of strategies to integrate QOL data in clinical care, as well as 
      the failure to contribute to policy decisions, particularly in cost analysis or 
      resource allocations, has created the perception that the construct of QOL in 
      schizophrenia is not that useful. It is evident that, for QOL in schizophrenia to 
      regain its promise, researchers must take the ultimate next step beyond 
      measurement: to develop credible strategies for integrating QOL data in clinical 
      practice. Additionally, more focused research is needed to demonstrate the role 
      of QOL, not only as an outcome in itself but also as a contributor to other 
      outcomes, such as adherence to medications, more satisfaction, less resource 
      utilization and so on. Since self-appraisal of QOL does not happen in a vacuum 
      but relates to the total human experience in all its biological, psychosocial and 
      environmental aspects, particular attention must also be focused on important 
      neurobiological dimensions such as affect and cognition. Both are significantly 
      affected by the illness itself and its treatment.

TI  - A proof of principle for using adaptive testing in Routine Outcome Monitoring: 
      the efficiency of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire -Anhedonic 
      Depression CAT.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1471-2288-12-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) there is a high demand for short 
      assessments. Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a promising method for 
      efficient assessment. In this article, the efficiency of a CAT version of the 
      Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, - Anhedonic Depression scale (MASQ-AD) 
      for use in ROM was scrutinized in a simulation study. METHODS: The responses of a 
      large sample of patients (N = 3,597) obtained through ROM were used. The 
      psychometric evaluation showed that the items met the requirements for CAT. In 
      the simulations, CATs with several measurement precision requirements were run on 
      the item responses as if they had been collected adaptively. RESULTS: CATs 
      employing only a small number of items gave results which, both in terms of 
      depression measurement and criterion validity, were only marginally different 
      from the results of a full MASQ-AD assessment. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that 
      CAT improved the efficiency of the MASQ-AD questionnaire very much. The strengths 
      and limitations of the application of CAT in ROM are discussed.

TI  - Psychosocial outcomes among youth with spinal cord injury and their primary 
      caregivers.
PG  - 67-72
LID - 10.1310/sci1801-67 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Past research has found youth with disabilities to experience poor 
      psychosocial outcomes, but little is known about factors related to psychosocial 
      health among youth with spinal cord injury (SCI). OBJECTIVE: To describe 
      psychosocial health among youth with SCI, examine relationships between 
      psychosocial outcomes and demographic and injury-related factors, and examine 
      relationships between aspects of psychosocial health. Youth activity, 
      participation, quality of life (QOL), coping, anxiety and depression, and 
      caregiver mental health were included. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a 
      prospective study of 420 youth with SCI ages 1-18 and their primary caregivers. 
      Activity data were also presented from a study developing a computerized adaptive 
      testing (CAT) platform with 226 youth with SCI ages 8-21. RESULTS: Although 
      relationships varied by factor, youth outcomes were related to youth age, sex, 
      age at injury/injury duration, and level/extent of injury. Caregiver mental 
      health related to child age and age at injury. Further, relationships were 
      uncovered between aspects of psychosocial health: aspects of youth mental health 
      were related to youth participation and QOL, youth coping was related to youth 
      mental health, participation, and QOL, and caregiver mental health was related to 
      child mental health and QOL. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial outcomes relate to each 
      other and vary by child and injury-related factors and should be understood in a 
      comprehensive, developmental context. Identifying best measures of activity and 
      psychosocial functioning among youth with SCI and understanding factors related 
      to their psychosocial health is critical to improving outcomes for the 
      pediatric-onset SCI population.

TI  - A multidimensional computer adaptive test approach to dyspnea assessment.
PG  - 1561-9
LID - 10.1016/j.apmr.2011.05.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a prototype dyspnea computer adaptive test (CAT). 
      DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Two outpatient medical facilities. 
      PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of adults (N=292) with chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We 
      developed a modified and expanded item bank and CAT for the Dyspnea Management 
      Questionnaire (DMQ), an outcome measure consisting of 4 dyspnea dimensions: 
      dyspnea intensity, dyspnea anxiety, activity avoidance, and activity 
      self-efficacy. RESULTS: Factor analyses supported a 4-dimensional model 
      underlying the 71 DMQ items. The DMQ item bank achieved acceptable Rasch model 
      fit statistics, good measurement breadth with minimal floor and ceiling effects, 
      and evidence of high internal consistency reliability (alpha=.92-.98). With the use 
      of CAT simulation analyses, the DMQ-CAT showed high measurement accuracy compared 
      with the total item pool (r=.83-.97, P<.0001) and evidence of good to excellent 
      concurrent validity (r=-.61 to -.80, P<.0001). All DMQ-CAT domains showed 
      evidence for known-groups validity (P</=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The DMQ-CAT reliably 
      and validly captured 4 distinct dyspnea domains. Multidimensional dyspnea 
      assessment in COPD is needed to better measure the effectiveness of 
      pharmacologic, pulmonary rehabilitation, and psychosocial interventions in not 
      only alleviating the somatic sensation of dyspnea but also reducing dysfunctional 
      emotions, cognitions, and behaviors associated with dyspnea, especially for 
      anxious patients.

TI  - PROMIS computerised adaptive tests are dynamic instruments to measure 
      health-related quality of life in patients with cirrhosis.
PG  - 1123-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04842.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients have an impaired health-related quality of life 
      (HRQOL), which is usually analysed using static paper-pencil questionnaires. The 
      Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computerised 
      adaptive testing (CAT) are flexible, freely available, noncopyrighted, HRQOL 
      instruments with US-based norms across 11 domains. CAT presents five to seven 
      questions/domain depending on the patient's response, from large validated 
      question banks. This provides brevity and precision equivalent to the entire 
      question bank. AIM: To evaluate PROMIS CAT tools against 'legacy instruments' for 
      cirrhotics and their informal caregivers. METHODS: A total of 200 subjects: 100 
      cirrhotics (70 men, 53% decompensated) and 100 caregivers were administered the 
      PROMIS and legacy instruments [Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Beck 
      depression/anxiety inventories, Pittsburgh Sleep-Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth 
      Sleepiness scale (ESS)] concurrently. Both legacy and PROMIS results for patients 
      were compared with caregivers and US norms. These were also compared between 
      compensated and decompensated patients. Preference for SIP or PROMIS was inquired 
      of a selected group (n = 70, 50% patients). Test - retest reliability was 
      assessed in another group of 20 patients. RESULTS: Patients had significant 
      impairment on all PROMIS domains apart from anger and anxiety compared with 
      caregivers and US norms (P < 0.02 to <0.0001). Decompensated patients had 
      significantly worse sleep, pain, social and physical function scores compared 
      with compensated ones, similar to legacy instruments. There was a statistically 
      significant correlation between PROMIS and their corresponding legacy 
      instruments. The majority (71%) preferred PROMIS over SIP. PROMIS tools had 
      significant test - retest reliability (ICC range 0.759-0.985) when administered 
      12 +/- 6 days apart. CONCLUSION: PROMIS computerised adaptive testing tools had 
      significant concurrent and discriminant validity, test - retest reliability and 
      subject preference for assessing HRQOL in cirrhotic patients.

TI  - A new approach to the measurement of adaptive behavior: development of the 
      PEDI-CAT for children and youth with autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 34-47

AB  - The use of current adaptive behavior measures in practice and research is limited 
      by their length and need for a professional interviewer. There is a need for 
      alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children 
      and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of 
      Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based 
      assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal 
      self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the 
      applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, 
      Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. 
      Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual 
      focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant 
      functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment 
      characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items 
      and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful 
      measure when used with this population.

TI  - An accurate and efficient identification of children with psychosocial problems 
      by means of computerized adaptive testing.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1186/1471-2288-11-111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Questionnaires used by health services to identify children with 
      psychosocial problems are often rather short. The psychometric properties of such 
      short questionnaires are mostly less than needed for an accurate distinction 
      between children with and without problems. We aimed to assess whether a short 
      Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) can overcome the weaknesses of short written 
      questionnaires when identifying children with psychosocial problems. METHOD: We 
      used a Dutch national data set obtained from parents of children invited for a 
      routine health examination by Preventive Child Healthcare with 205 items on 
      behavioral and emotional problems (n = 2,041, response 84%). In a random 
      subsample we determined which items met the requirements of an Item Response 
      Theory (IRT) model to a sufficient degree. Using those items, item parameters 
      necessary for a CAT were calculated and a cut-off point was defined. In the 
      remaining subsample we determined the validity and efficiency of a Computerized 
      Adaptive Test using simulation techniques, with current treatment status and a 
      clinical score on the Total Problem Scale (TPS) of the Child Behavior Checklist 
      as criteria. RESULTS: Out of 205 items available 190 sufficiently met the 
      criteria of the underlying IRT model. For 90% of the children a score above or 
      below cut-off point could be determined with 95% accuracy. The mean number of 
      items needed to achieve this was 12. Sensitivity and specificity with the TPS as 
      a criterion were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively. CONCLUSION: An IRT-based CAT is a 
      very promising option for the identification of psychosocial problems in 
      children, as it can lead to an efficient, yet high-quality identification. The 
      results of our simulation study need to be replicated in a real-life 
      administration of this CAT.

TI  - Quality-of-life measures in children with neurological conditions: pediatric 
      Neuro-QOL.
PG  - 36-47
LID - 10.1177/1545968311412054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A comprehensive, reliable, and valid measurement system is needed to 
      monitor changes in children with neurological conditions who experience lifelong 
      functional limitations. OBJECTIVE: This article describes the development and 
      psychometric properties of the pediatric version of the Quality of Life in 
      Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) measurement system. METHODS: The pediatric 
      Neuro-QOL consists of generic and targeted measures. Literature review, focus 
      groups, individual interviews, cognitive interviews of children and consensus 
      meetings were used to identify and finalize relevant domains and item content. 
      Testing was conducted on 1018 children aged 10 to 17 years drawn from the US 
      general population for generic measures and 171 similarly aged children with 
      muscular dystrophy or epilepsy for targeted measures. Dimensionality was 
      evaluated using factor analytic methods. For unidimensional domains, item 
      parameters were estimated using item response theory models. Measures with 
      acceptable fit indices were calibrated as item banks; those without acceptable 
      fit indices were treated as summary scales. RESULTS: Ten measures were developed: 
      8 generic or targeted banks (anxiety, depression, anger, interaction with peers, 
      fatigue, pain, applied cognition, and stigma) and 2 generic scales (upper and 
      lower extremity function). The banks reliably (r > 0.90) measured 63.2% to 100% 
      of the children tested. CONCLUSIONS: The pediatric Neuro-QOL is a comprehensive 
      measurement system with acceptable psychometric properties that could be used in 
      computerized adaptive testing. The next step is to validate these measures in 
      various clinical populations.

TI  - The psychosocial impact of cancer: evidence in support of independent general 
      positive and negative components.
PG  - 195-207
LID - 10.1007/s11136-011-9935-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Considerable research has demonstrated the negative psychosocial impact 
      of cancer. Recent work has highlighted positive psychosocial outcomes. Research 
      is now needed to evaluate the relationship between negative and positive impacts. 
      This paper reports the development and validation of a measurement model 
      capturing positive and negative psychosocial illness impacts. METHODS: The sample 
      included 754 cancer patients on- or post-treatment. Item development was informed 
      by literature review, expert input patient interviews and the results of a pilot 
      study of 205 cancer patients, resulting in 43 positive and 46 negative items. 
      Factor analyses were used to evaluate the dimensionality of the item pools. 
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine relationships between 
      psychosocial illness impact and other variables. RESULTS: Unidimensionality was 
      demonstrated within but not across negative and positive impact items. ANOVA 
      results showed differential relationships between negative and positive impacts, 
      respectively, and patient sociodemographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSION: 
      Positive and negative psychosocial illness impacts are best conceptualized and 
      measured as two independent factors. Computerized adaptive tests and short-form 
      measures developed from this comprehensive psychosocial illness impact item bank 
      may benefit future research and clinical applications.

TI  - Social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy: a review.
PG  - 27-38
LID - 10.1111/j.1442-9071.2011.02599.x [doi]
AB  - People with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy are likely to experience 
      enhanced social and emotional strain. Critically, those with both 
      vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and psychosocial problems may have 
      significantly reduced levels of functioning compared with psychologically healthy 
      counterparts. This can cause inadequate compliance, increased strain on family 
      functioning, worse diabetes control, increased progression of diabetic 
      retinopathy and, consequently, further psychosocial stress resulting in a number 
      of concerning implications for disease management, clinical outcomes and 
      healthcare costs. However, the emotional and social health consequences of 
      diabetic retinopathy have not yet been systematically explored. This information 
      is crucial as it allows for a targeted approach to treatment and prevention and 
      avoidance of the potentially detrimental implications described above. Therefore, 
      this paper reviews the current qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding 
      the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and identifies directions 
      for future research. Key search terms were applied to the electronic databases 
      Pubmed, ISI Web of Science and Embase and the bibliographies of relevant papers 
      were systematically reviewed for additional references. Overall, the evidence 
      suggests that diabetic retinopathy and associated vision loss have several 
      debilitating effects, including disruption of family functioning, relationships 
      and roles; increased social isolation and dependence; and deterioration of work 
      prospects resulting in increased financial strain. Adverse emotional responses 
      include fear, anxiety, vulnerability, guilt, loss of confidence, anger, stress 
      and self-perception issues. However, the research to date is largely qualitative 
      in nature, with most quantitative studies being small, cross-sectional and 
      somewhat outdated. Similarly, the outcome measures used in many studies to date 
      are suboptimal in terms of content and validity. Therefore, this review 
      identifies the need for improved outcome measures to provide valid, meaningful 
      measurement of the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and 
      discusses potential directions for future research such as item banking and 
      computer adaptive testing.

TI  - Brief, valid measures of dyspnea and related functional limitations in chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
PG  - 307-15
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2010.11.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease 
      with functional decline leading to disability. Dyspnea, the prominent symptom, 
      can be measured using existing measures, but a lack of consensus about 
      standardization of dyspnea measurement remains. We examined the psychometric 
      performance of two item-response theory-based (IRT) measures of dyspnea and 
      related functional limitations (FLs) in patients with COPD and simulated 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of the banks to determine the number of 
      questions required to achieve high precision. METHODS: A total of 102 patients 
      completed banks measuring dyspnea and FLs (33 items), from which the 10-item 
      dyspnea and FL short forms were scored as well as other self-report measures of 
      respiratory and physical function and emotional distress. A subset of patients 
      completed the banks 7 to 10 days later. Pulmonary function test results were 
      obtained from medical charts. RESULTS: The 33-item banks and 10-item short forms 
      had excellent internal consistency (alphas >0.9) and test-retest reliability 
      (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.89). Patients sorted by severity level on 
      the Medical Research Council scale were differentiated by item banks (P < 0.001) 
      and the short forms (P < 0.01). The banks and short forms were also associated 
      with related measures of dyspnea (e.g., Baseline Dyspnea Index, r = 0.47-0.53), 
      physical function (e.g., 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, r = -0.83 to -0.86) 
      and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = -0.32 to -0.35). On average, CAT 
      required 4 and 5 items for accurate measurement of dyspnea and FLs, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Dyspnea short 
      forms and banks provide options for brief, psychometrically sound measures of 
      dyspnea and/or FLs in COPD.

TI  - Conceptualizing functional cognition in traumatic brain injury rehabilitation.
PG  - 348-64
LID - 10.3109/02699052.2011.556105 [doi]
AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To conceptualize functional cognitive constructs across the 
      continuum of traumatic brain injury (TBI) recovery, to form the foundation for 
      the Computer Adaptive Measure of Functional Cognition for TBI (CAMFC-TBI). 
      BACKGROUND: TBI often has a profound impact on a survivor's ability to return to 
      previous level of functioning and significantly reduces the overall quality of 
      life for survivors and caregivers. Few assessments are designed to evaluate TBI's 
      impact on cognitive functioning in everyday life. Neuropsychological tests are 
      time consuming and may have questionable ecological validity for predicting 
      functional outcomes. Global functional assessments contain few cognitive items 
      and may lack psychometric rigour. Presently there is a lack of efficient, 
      precise, ecologically valid functional cognitive measures. MAIN OUTCOME AND 
      RESULTS: Studies that used neuropsychological and global functional assessments 
      were reviewed to direct conceptualization of functional cognitive constructs 
      across TBI recovery stages. An advisory panel reviewed study methodology and 
      functional cognitive constructs development. They validated the need for the 
      CAMFC-TBI and the six functional cognitive constructs: attention, memory, 
      processing speed, executive functioning, social communication and emotional 
      management. CONCLUSION: Conceptualizing functional cognitive constructs is the 
      first step in CAMFC-TBI development. Future project stages include item pool 
      development, qualitative testing, field-testing, psychometric analysis and 
      computerized adaptive test programming.

TI  - Outcome measurement for COPD: reliability and validity of the Dyspnea Management 
      Questionnaire.
PG  - 442-53
LID - 10.1016/j.rmed.2010.09.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Dyspnea Management Questionnaire (DMQ) is a measure of the 
      psychosocial and behavioral responses to dyspnea for adults with COPD. The 
      research objectives were to evaluate the reliability and validity of an expanded 
      DMQ item pool, as a preliminary step for developing a computer adaptive test. 
      METHODS: The original 66 items of the DMQ were used for the analyses. The sample 
      included 63 women and 44 men with COPD (n = 107) recruited from two urban medical 
      centers. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the factor structure of the 
      DMQ and its underlying cognitive-behavioral theoretical base. The internal 
      consistency and test-retest reliability, and breadth of coverage of the expanded 
      DMQ item bank were also evaluated. RESULTS: Five distinct dyspnea domains were 
      confirmed using 56 original items of the DMQ: dyspnea intensity, dyspnea anxiety, 
      activity avoidance, activity self-efficacy, and strategy satisfaction. Overall, 
      the breadth of items was excellent with a good match between sample scores and 
      item difficulty. The DMQ-56 showed good internal consistency reliability (alpha = 
      0.85-to 0.96) and good preliminary test-retest reliability over a 3-week interval 
      (ICC = 0.69-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The DMQ demonstrated acceptable levels of 
      reliability and validity for measuring multidimensional dyspnea outcomes after 
      medical, psychological, and behavioral interventions for adults with COPD.

TI  - The value of item response theory in clinical assessment: a review.
PG  - 291-307
LID - 10.1177/1073191110374797 [doi]
AB  - Item response theory (IRT) and related latent variable models represent modern 
      psychometric theory, the successor to classical test theory in psychological 
      assessment. Although IRT has become prevalent in the measurement of ability and 
      achievement, its contributions to clinical domains have been less extensive. 
      Applications of IRT to clinical assessment are reviewed to appraise its current 
      and potential value. Benefits of IRT include comprehensive analyses and reduction 
      of measurement error, creation of computer adaptive tests, meaningful scaling of 
      latent variables, objective calibration and equating, evaluation of test and item 
      bias, greater accuracy in the assessment of change due to therapeutic 
      intervention, and evaluation of model and person fit. The theory may soon 
      reinvent the manner in which tests are selected, developed, and scored. Although 
      challenges remain to the widespread implementation of IRT, its application to 
      clinical assessment holds great promise. Recommendations for research, test 
      development, and clinical practice are provided.

TI  - A computerized adaptive test for patients with shoulder impairments produced 
      responsive measures of function.
PG  - 928-38
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20090342 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) promise efficient outcomes data 
      collection with little loss of measurement precision. The shoulder CAT has not 
      been assessed for administrative efficiency, nor have prospective studies been 
      completed to evaluate the sensitivity to change or the responsiveness of 
      CAT-based functional status (CAT-FS) measures. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate the efficiency and responsiveness of the shoulder CAT. 
      DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. METHODS: 
      Data were analyzed from patients with shoulder impairments who received 
      outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 US states. Over the testing time, 
      30,987 patients completed the shoulder CAT at intake, and of these, 13,805 
      completed the CAT at discharge (45% completion rate). The efficiency of routine 
      CAT administration was evaluated, and the sensitivity to change and 
      responsiveness of CAT-FS measures were assessed. RESULTS: On average, patients 
      took about 1.5 minutes (SD <2 minutes) to answer 6 CAT items (SD=2), which 
      produced precise estimates of CAT-FS measures that adequately covered the content 
      range and had negligible floor and minimal ceiling effects. Ninety-four percent 
      of the patients had CAT-FS scores between 20 and 80, where upper-level 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) standard errors were between 3.2 and 4.6 (out of 100). 
      Of patients with both intake and discharge data, 79% had CAT-FS change scores 
      greater than minimal detectable change, and 76% had changes greater than minimal 
      clinically important improvement. LIMITATIONS: Because this study was a secondary 
      analysis, the results may have been affected by patient selection bias. Future 
      studies would benefit from more complete data. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate 
      the shoulder CAT was efficient and support the precision, sensitivity, and 
      responsiveness of CAT-FS measures.

TI  - An application of computerised adaptive testing for measuring health status in 
      patients with knee osteoarthritis.
PG  - 1928-38
LID - 10.3109/09638281003777572 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of computerised 
      adaptive testing (CAT) for measuring health status in knee osteoarthritis. 
      METHOD: Three hundred and fifty-one patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) 
      answered 118 questions from a range of widely used questionnaires. Three 
      dimensions relevant to knee OA were identified by expert opinion as 'pain, mental 
      and emotional status'; 'self-care and household activities' and 'mobility and 
      social activities'. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the 
      relationship between the items and their dimensions. After CFA, these dimensions 
      were subjected to Rasch analysis to calibrate the items onto an interval scale. A 
      CAT was developed for each dimension, and the results checked against simulated 
      applications from 10,000 simulees. RESULTS: After CFA and Rasch analysis, 14, 22 
      and 23 items remained in the first, second and third dimensions, respectively. 
      Items were mostly free of differential item functioning for age, gender and 
      duration of disease. Reliability exceeded 0.87 for each dimension. The health 
      status levels generated using item banks and those obtained from the simulated 
      CAT application were highly correlated (i.e. >0.91 for each dimension). On 
      average, 8, 10 and 10 items were used to estimate the health status levels using 
      the CAT for the first, second and third dimensions respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Using a combination approach of CFA and Rasch analysis, this study has shown that 
      it is possible to calibrate items onto a single metric in a way that can be used 
      to provide the basis of a CAT application.

TI  - An item response analysis of the pediatric PROMIS anxiety and depressive symptoms 
      scales.
PG  - 595-607
LID - 10.1007/s11136-010-9619-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      aims to develop self-reported item banks for clinical research. The PROMIS 
      pediatrics (aged 8-17) project focuses on the development of item banks across 
      several health domains (physical function, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, 
      social role relationships, and asthma symptoms). The psychometric properties of 
      the anxiety and depressive symptom item banks are described. METHODS: 
      Participants (n = 1,529) were recruited in public school settings, hospital-based 
      outpatient and subspecialty pediatrics clinics. The anxiety (k = 18) and 
      depressive symptoms (k = 21) items were split between two test administration 
      forms. Hierarchical confirmatory factor-analytic models (CFA) were conducted to 
      evaluate scale dimensionality and local dependence. IRT analyses were then used 
      to finalize item banks and short forms. RESULTS: CFA results confirmed that 
      anxiety and depressive symptoms are separate constructs and indicative of 
      negative affect. Items with local dependence and DIF were removed resulting in 15 
      anxiety and 14 depressive symptoms items. The psychometric differences between 
      short forms and simulated computer adaptive tests are presented. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PROMIS pediatric item banks were developed to provide efficient assessment of 
      health-related quality of life domains. This sample provides initial calibrations 
      of anxiety and depressive symptoms item banks and creates PROMIS pediatric 
      instruments, version 1.0.

PG  - 192-206
AB  - In this guide, the authors outline the advantages of online eAssessment and 
      examine the intellectual, technical, legal and cost issues that arise from its 
      use. This guide outlines the major assessment types that are suitable for online 
      assessment and makes a key distinction between formative and summative 
      assessment. The focus is primarily on the latter since that is where the 
      difficulties are most acute and robust systems most critical. A range of 
      practical issues relating to the key stages in running a summative e-exam are 
      explored and advice given on system requirements and on how to ensure that the 
      exam runs smoothly when you 'go live'. This section includes consideration of the 
      way that using eAssessment might affect the standard setting and results analysis 
      process. The section on future trends in online assessment explores possibilities 
      such as computer adaptive testing and the automated assessment of free text 
      answers. Finally, there is a consideration of the implications of these trends 
      for management.

TI  - Differential item functioning was negligible in an adaptive test of functional 
      status for patients with knee impairments who spoke English or Hebrew.
PG  - 1067-83
LID - 10.1007/s11136-009-9517-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the presence and impact of differential item functioning 
      (DIF) in a set of knee-specific functional status (FS) items administered using 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT) among English (United States) and Hebrew 
      (Israel) speaking patients receiving therapy for knee impairments. DIF occurs in 
      an item if probabilities of endorsing responses differ across groups after 
      controlling for the FS measured. METHODS: We analyzed data from 28,320 patients 
      (14,160 U.S., 14,160 Israel) who completed the knee-specific CAT. Items were 
      assessed for DIF by gender, age, symptom acuity, surgical history, exercise 
      history, and language spoken using a hybrid technique that combines multiple 
      ordinal logistic regression and item response theory FS estimates. RESULTS: 
      Several items had non-uniform DIF for covariates including language, but 
      unadjusted and DIF-adjusted functional status estimates were in strong 
      concordance [ICC(2,1) values >/=0.97], and differences between unadjusted and 
      adjusted FS scores represented <0.4% of the unadjusted FS standard deviation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant DIF was identified in some items but 
      represented negligible clinical impact. Results suggested no need to adjust items 
      for DIF when assessing FS outcomes across groups of patients with knee 
      impairments who answer the knee CAT items in English in the United States or 
      Hebrew in Israel. These findings suggest negligible differences in cultural 
      perceptions between English and Hebrew wording of these knee-specific CAT FS 
      items.

TI  - A functional difficulty and functional pain instrument for hip and knee 
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - R107
LID - 10.1186/ar2760 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to develop a functional outcome 
      instrument for hip and knee osteoarthritis research (OA-FUNCTION-CAT) using item 
      response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive test (CAT) methods and to assess its 
      psychometric performance compared to the current standard in the field. METHODS: 
      We conducted an extensive literature review, focus groups, and cognitive testing 
      to guide the construction of an item bank consisting of 125 functional activities 
      commonly affected by hip and knee osteoarthritis. We recruited a convenience 
      sample of 328 adults with confirmed hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Subjects 
      reported their degree of functional difficulty and functional pain in performing 
      each activity in the item bank and completed the Western Ontario and McMaster 
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Confirmatory factor analyses were 
      conducted to assess scale uni-dimensionality, and IRT methods were used to 
      calibrate the items and examine the fit of the data. We assessed the performance 
      of OA-FUNCTION-CATs of different lengths relative to the full item bank and WOMAC 
      using CAT simulation analyses. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed 
      distinct functional difficulty and functional pain domains. Descriptive 
      statistics for scores from 5-, 10-, and 15-item CATs were similar to those for 
      the full item bank. The 10-item OA-FUNCTION-CAT scales demonstrated a high degree 
      of accuracy compared with the item bank (r = 0.96 and 0.89, respectively). 
      Compared to the WOMAC, both scales covered a broader score range and demonstrated 
      a higher degree of precision at the ceiling and reliability across the range of 
      scores. CONCLUSIONS: The OA-FUNCTION-CAT provided superior reliability throughout 
      the score range and improved breadth and precision at the ceiling compared with 
      the WOMAC. Further research is needed to assess whether these improvements carry 
      over into superior ability to measure change.

TI  - Bilingual health literacy assessment using the Talking Touchscreen/la Pantalla 
      Parlanchina: Development and pilot testing.
PG  - 295-301
LID - 10.1016/j.pec.2009.02.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current health literacy measures are too long, imprecise, or have 
      questionable equivalence of English and Spanish versions. The purpose of this 
      paper is to describe the development and pilot testing of a new bilingual 
      computer-based health literacy assessment tool. METHODS: We analyzed literacy 
      data from three large studies. Using a working definition of health literacy, we 
      developed new prose, document and quantitative items in English and Spanish. 
      Items were pilot tested on 97 English- and 134 Spanish-speaking participants to 
      assess item difficulty. RESULTS: Items covered topics relevant to primary care 
      patients and providers. English- and Spanish-speaking participants understood the 
      tasks involved in answering each type of question. The English Talking 
      Touchscreen was easy to use and the English and Spanish items provided good 
      coverage of the difficulty continuum. CONCLUSION: Qualitative and quantitative 
      results provided useful information on computer acceptability and initial item 
      difficulty. After the items have been administered on the Talking Touchscreen (la 
      Pantalla Parlanchina) to 600 English-speaking (and 600 Spanish-speaking) primary 
      care patients, we will develop a computer adaptive test. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: 
      This health literacy tool will enable clinicians and researchers to more 
      precisely determine the level at which low health literacy adversely affects 
      health and healthcare utilization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a prototype measure (OA-DISABILITY-CAT) for 
      osteoarthritis research using item response theory (IRT) and computer-adaptive 
      test (CAT) methodologies. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We constructed an item bank 
      consisting of 33 activities commonly affected by lower extremity (LE) 
      osteoarthritis. A sample of 323 adults with LE osteoarthritis reported their 
      degree of limitation in performing everyday activities, and completed the Health 
      Assessment Questionnaire-II (HAQ-II). We used confirmatory factor analyses to 
      assess scale unidimensionality and IRT methods to calibrate the items and examine 
      the fit of the data. Using CAT simulation analyses, we examined the performance 
      of OA-DISABILITY-CATs of different lengths compared with the full-item bank and 
      the HAQ-II. RESULTS: One distinct disability domain was identified. The 10-item 
      OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated a high degree of accuracy compared with the 
      full-item bank (r=0.99). The item bank and the HAQ-II scales covered a similar 
      estimated scoring range. In terms of reliability, 95% of OA-DISABILITY 
      reliability estimates were over 0.83 vs. 0.60 for the HAQ-II. Except at the 
      highest scores, the 10-item OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated superior precision to 
      the HAQ-II. CONCLUSION: The prototype OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated promising 
      measurement properties compared with the HAQ-II, and is recommended for use in LE 
      osteoarthritis research.

TI  - Evaluation of a computer-adaptive test for the assessment of depression (D-CAT) 
      in clinical application.
PG  - 23-36
LID - 10.1002/mpr.274 [doi]
AB  - In the past, a German Computerized Adaptive Test, based on Item Response Theory 
      (IRT), was developed for purposes of assessing the construct depression 
      [Computer-adaptive test for depression (D-CAT)]. This study aims at testing the 
      feasibility and validity of the real computer-adaptive application.The D-CAT, 
      supplied by a bank of 64 items, was administered on personal digital assistants 
      (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical 
      conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a 
      predetermined reliability (r > or = 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes, 
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Centre for Epidemiological 
      Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were 
      administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized 
      diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)].The 
      D-CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds), well accepted by the patients and 
      reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95% of the cases, 
      10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between 
      the D-CAT and the HADS, CES-D, and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The 
      D-CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established 
      questionnaires do.The D-CAT proved an efficient, well accepted and reliable tool. 
      Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures, whereby the CAT 
      is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item 
      selection for content in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the Computerized Adaptive Test 
      to measure anxiety (A-CAT), a patient-reported outcome questionnaire that uses 
      computerized adaptive testing to measure anxiety. METHODS: The A-CAT builds on an 
      item bank of 50 items that has been built using conventional item analyses and 
      item response theory analyses. The A-CAT was administered on Personal Digital 
      Assistants to n=357 patients diagnosed and treated at the department of 
      Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Charite Berlin, Germany. For validation 
      purposes, two subgroups of patients (n=110 and 125) answered the A-CAT along with 
      established anxiety and depression questionnaires. RESULTS: The A-CAT was fast to 
      complete (on average in 2 min, 38 s) and a precise item response theory based CAT 
      score (reliability>.9) could be estimated after 4-41 items. On average, the CAT 
      displayed 6 items (SD=4.2). Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by 
      correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck 
      Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety 
      Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher 
      for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures. CONCLUSIONS: The German A-CAT is 
      an efficient, reliable, and valid tool for assessing anxiety in patients 
      suffering from anxiety disorders and other conditions with significant potential 
      for initial assessment and long-term treatment monitoring. Future research 
      directions are to explore content balancing of the item selection algorithm of 
      the CAT, to norm the tool to a healthy sample, and to develop practical cutoff 
      scores.

TI  - The development of frequency weighting for speech in children with a history of 
      otitis media with effusion.
PG  - 718-24
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0b013e31817a98cb [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of chronic (recurrent) otitis media with 
      effusion (OME) on frequency weighting in the perception of speech in noise. It 
      was hypothesized that children with a history of OME weight speech information in 
      the mid frequency region higher than control children. DESIGN: This is a matched 
      cohort study looking at differences in frequency weighting in 12 children with a 
      history of OME 1 to 2 wks after placement of tympanostomy tubes compared with 21 
      control children. Children were tested on their ability to identify key words in 
      sentences presented in speech-shaped noise. The frequency content of the 
      sentences was manipulated to determine the relative importance of frequencies in 
      the regions of 1, 2, and 4 kHz. The frequency bands selected were 798 to 1212 Hz 
      (low band), 1575 to 2425 Hz (mid band), and 3000 to 5000 Hz (high band). Initial 
      testing involved adaptive runs where a speech-shaped masker was held at a 
      constant level and the level of the speech with all three bands present varied. 
      Once a level corresponding to 85% to 90% correct was identified, novel sentences 
      were then presented at this signal-to-noise ratio in fixed block runs, with all 
      bands present, or with one of the three bands omitted. RESULTS: The children in 
      the OME group achieved 85% to 90% correct at a lower signal-to-noise ratio than 
      controls in the adaptive testing, where all three speech bands were present. 
      Fixed block testing indicated that children with OME history gave more weight to 
      speech frequencies in the region of 2000 Hz compared with the age-matched control 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with an interpretation that the 
      development of frequency weighting in the perception of speech can be affected by 
      a history of OME.

TI  - An evaluation of patient-reported outcomes found computerized adaptive testing 
      was efficient in assessing stress perception.
PG  - 278-87, 287.e1-3
LID - 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2008.03.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a first computerized 
      adaptive test (CAT) for the measurement of stress perception (Stress-CAT), in 
      terms of the two dimensions: exposure to stress and stress reaction. STUDY DESIGN 
      AND SETTING: Item response theory modeling was performed using a two-parameter 
      model (Generalized Partial Credit Model). The evaluation of the Stress-CAT 
      comprised a simulation study and real clinical application. A total of 1,092 
      psychosomatic patients (N1) were studied. Two hundred simulees (N2) were 
      generated for a simulated response data set. Then the Stress-CAT was given to 
      n=116 inpatients, (N3) together with established stress questionnaires as 
      validity criteria. RESULTS: The final banks included n=38 stress exposure items 
      and n=31 stress reaction items. In the first simulation study, CAT scores could 
      be estimated with a high measurement precision (SE<0.32; rho>0.90) using 
      7.0+/-2.3 (M+/-SD) stress reaction items and 11.6+/-1.7 stress exposure items. 
      The second simulation study reanalyzed real patients data (N1) and showed an 
      average use of items of 5.6+/-2.1 for the dimension stress reaction and 
      10.0+/-4.9 for the dimension stress exposure. Convergent validity showed 
      significantly high correlations. CONCLUSIONS: The Stress-CAT is short and 
      precise, potentially lowering the response burden of patients in clinical 
      decision making.

      assessment.
PG  - 361-8
LID - 10.1176/ps.2008.59.4.361 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the combination of item response theory and 
      computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for psychiatric measurement as a means of 
      reducing the burden of research and clinical assessments. METHODS: Data were from 
      800 participants in outpatient treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder; they 
      completed 616 items of the 626-item Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Scales (MASS) at 
      two times. The first administration was used to design and evaluate a CAT version 
      of the MASS by using post hoc simulation. The second confirmed the functioning of 
      CAT in live testing. RESULTS: Tests of competing models based on item response 
      theory supported the scale's bifactor structure, consisting of a primary 
      dimension and four group factors (mood, panic-agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, 
      and social phobia). Both simulated and live CAT showed a 95% average reduction 
      (585 items) in items administered (24 and 30 items, respectively) compared with 
      administration of the full MASS. The correlation between scores on the full MASS 
      and the CAT version was .93. For the mood disorder subscale, differences in 
      scores between two groups of depressed patients--one with bipolar disorder and 
      one without--on the full scale and on the CAT showed effect sizes of .63 (p<.003) 
      and 1.19 (p<.001) standard deviation units, respectively, indicating better 
      discriminant validity for CAT. CONCLUSIONS: Instead of using small fixed-length 
      tests, clinicians can create item banks with a large item pool, and a small set 
      of the items most relevant for a given individual can be administered with no 
      loss of information, yielding a dramatic reduction in administration time and 
      patient and clinician burden.

TI  - Evaluation of a preliminary physical function item bank supported the expected 
      advantages of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS).
PG  - 17-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      was initiated to improve precision, reduce respondent burden, and enhance the 
      comparability of health outcomes measures. We used item response theory (IRT) to 
      construct and evaluate a preliminary item bank for physical function assuming 
      four subdomains. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data from seven samples (N=17,726) 
      using 136 items from nine questionnaires were evaluated. A generalized partial 
      credit model was used to estimate item parameters, which were normed to a mean of 
      50 (SD=10) in the US population. Item bank properties were evaluated through 
      Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) simulations. RESULTS: IRT requirements were 
      fulfilled by 70 items covering activities of daily living, lower extremity, and 
      central body functions. The original item context partly affected parameter 
      stability. Items on upper body function, and need for aid or devices did not fit 
      the IRT model. In simulations, a 10-item CAT eliminated floor and decreased 
      ceiling effects, achieving a small standard error (< 2.2) across scores from 20 
      to 50 (reliability >0.95 for a representative US sample). This precision was not 
      achieved over a similar range by any comparable fixed length item sets. 
      CONCLUSION: The methods of the PROMIS project are likely to substantially improve 
      measures of physical function and to increase the efficiency of their 
      administration using CAT.

PG  - 122-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 65% of individuals demonstrate poststroke cognitive 
      impairments, which may increase hospital stay and caregiver burden. Randomized 
      stroke clinical trials have emphasized physical recovery over cognition. 
      Neuropsychological assessments have had limited utility in randomized clinical 
      trials. These issues accentuate the need for a measure of functional cognition 
      (the ability to accomplish everyday activities that rely on cognitive abilities, 
      such as locating keys, conveying information, or planning activities). OBJECTIVE: 
      The aim of the study was to present the process used to establish domains of 
      functional cognition for development of computer adaptive measure of functional 
      cognition for stroke. METHODS: Functional cognitive domains involved in 
      identifying relevant neuropsychological constructs from the literature were 
      conceptualized and finalized after advisory panel feedback from experts in 
      neurology, neuropsychology, aphasiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology. 
      RESULTS: The following 17 domains were proposed: receptive aphasia, expressive 
      aphasia, agraphia, alexia, calculation, visuospatial, visuoperceptual, 
      visuoconstruction, attention, language usage, executive functions, orientation, 
      processing speed, memory, working memory, mood, awareness and abstract reasoning. 
      The advisory panel recommended retaining the first 12 domains. Recommended 
      changes included: to address only encoding and retrieval of recent information in 
      the memory domain; to add domains for limb apraxia and poststroke depression; and 
      to keep orientation as a separate domain or reclassify it under memory or 
      attention. The final 10 domains included: language, reading and writing, 
      numeric/calculation, limb praxis, visuospatial function, social use of language, 
      emotional function, attention, executive function, and memory. CONCLUSION: 
      Conceptualizing domains of functional cognition is the first step in developing a 
      computer adaptive measure of functional cognition for stroke. Additional steps 
      include developing, refining, and field-testing items, psychometric analysis, and 
      computer adaptive test programming.

TI  - Evaluating measurement equivalence using the item response theory log-likelihood 
      ratio (IRTLR) method to assess differential item functioning (DIF): applications 
      (with illustrations) to measures of physical functioning ability and general 
      distress.
PG  - 43-68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methods based on item response theory (IRT) that can be used to 
      examine differential item functioning (DIF) are illustrated. An IRT-based 
      approach to the detection of DIF was applied to physical function and general 
      distress item sets. DIF was examined with respect to gender, age and race. The 
      method used for DIF detection was the item response theory log-likelihood ratio 
      (IRTLR) approach. DIF magnitude was measured using the differences in the 
      expected item scores, expressed as the unsigned probability differences, and 
      calculated using the non-compensatory DIF index (NCDIF). Finally, impact was 
      assessed using expected scale scores, expressed as group differences in the total 
      test (measure) response functions. METHODS: The example for the illustration of 
      the methods came from a study of 1,714 patients with cancer or HIV/AIDS. The 
      measure contained 23 items measuring physical functioning ability and 15 items 
      addressing general distress, scored in the positive direction. RESULTS: The 
      substantive findings were of relatively small magnitude DIF. In total, six items 
      showed relatively larger magnitude (expected item score differences greater than 
      the cutoff) of DIF with respect to physical function across the three 
      comparisons: "trouble with a long walk" (race), "vigorous activities" (race, 
      age), "bending, kneeling stooping" (age), "lifting or carrying groceries" (race), 
      "limited in hobbies, leisure" (age), "lack of energy" (race). None of the general 
      distress items evidenced high magnitude DIF; although "worrying about dying" 
      showed some DIF with respect to both age and race, after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The fact that many physical function items showed DIF with respect to age, even 
      after adjustment for multiple comparisons, indicates that the instrument may be 
      performing differently for these groups. While the magnitude and impact of DIF at 
      the item and scale level was minimal, caution should be exercised in the use of 
      subsets of these items, as might occur with selection for clinical decisions or 
      computerized adaptive testing. The issues of selection of anchor items, and of 
      criteria for DIF detection, including the integration of significance and 
      magnitude measures remain as issues requiring investigation. Further research is 
      needed regarding the criteria and guidelines appropriate for DIF detection in the 
      context of health-related items.

TI  - Psychometric evaluation and calibration of health-related quality of life item 
      banks: plans for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS).
PG  - S22-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: The construction and evaluation of item banks to measure 
      unidimensional constructs of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a 
      fundamental objective of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System (PROMIS) project. OBJECTIVES: Item banks will be used as the foundation 
      for developing short-form instruments and enabling computerized adaptive testing. 
      The PROMIS Steering Committee selected 5 HRQOL domains for initial focus: 
      physical functioning, fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and social role 
      participation. This report provides an overview of the methods used in the PROMIS 
      item analyses and proposed calibration of item banks. ANALYSES: Analyses include 
      evaluation of data quality (eg, logic and range checking, spread of response 
      distribution within an item), descriptive statistics (eg, frequencies, means), 
      item response theory model assumptions (unidimensionality, local independence, 
      monotonicity), model fit, differential item functioning, and item calibration for 
      banking. RECOMMENDATIONS: Summarized are key analytic issues; recommendations are 
      provided for future evaluations of item banks in HRQOL assessment.

TI  - Applying item response theory and computer adaptive testing: the challenges for 
      health outcomes assessment.
PG  - 187-94
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We review the papers presented at the NCI/DIA conference, to identify 
      areas of controversy and uncertainty, and to highlight those aspects of item 
      response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) that require 
      theoretical or empirical research in order to justify their application to 
      patient reported outcomes (PROs). BACKGROUND: IRT and CAT offer exciting 
      potential for the development of a new generation of PRO instruments. However, 
      most of the research into these techniques has been in non-healthcare settings, 
      notably in education. Educational tests are very different from PRO instruments, 
      and consequently problematic issues arise when adapting IRT and CAT to healthcare 
      research. RESULTS: Clinical scales differ appreciably from educational tests, and 
      symptoms have characteristics distinctly different from examination questions. 
      This affects the transferring of IRT technology. Particular areas of concern when 
      applying IRT to PROs include inadequate software, difficulties in selecting 
      models and communicating results, insufficient testing of local independence and 
      other assumptions, and a need of guidelines for estimating sample size 
      requirements. Similar concerns apply to differential item functioning (DIF), 
      which is an important application of IRT. Multidimensional IRT is likely to be 
      advantageous only for closely related PRO dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Although IRT 
      and CAT provide appreciable potential benefits, there is a need for 
      circumspection. Not all PRO scales are necessarily appropriate targets for this 
      methodology. Traditional psychometric methods, and especially qualitative 
      methods, continue to have an important role alongside IRT. Research should be 
      funded to address the specific concerns that have been identified.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a computer adaptive test for 'Anxiety' 
      (Anxiety-CAT).
PG  - 143-55
AB  - Within the framework of item response theory (IRT), we developed a German version 
      of an item bank, as well as a software application that can be employed to 
      measure anxiety by means of a computer adaptive test (CAT). A sample of n = 2348 
      psychiatric and psychosomatic patients answered a set of up to 13 standardized 
      questionnaires. 81 items drawn from these questionnaires were considered 
      pertinent to the anxiety construct. Various tests were conducted to ensure the 
      suitability of these items for an IRT-based assessment. After these tests, 50 
      items remained in the item bank and were calibrated using the Generalized Partial 
      Credit Model. Simulation studies conducted on an independent sample of n = 1528 
      respondents indicate that 6-8 items suffice to measure the latent trait with high 
      precision (standard error <or= 0.32). CAT scores correlated highly with scores 
      estimated from all available items (r = .97) and scale scores of the State Trait 
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI, state scale, r = .93). Within a routine clinical 
      setting, 102 in-patients answered the Anxiety-CAT along with a number of 
      established anxiety questionnaires. The correlation between the Anxiety-CAT and 
      the STAI state scale was still high (r = .60), but lower than the correlations 
      found in the simulation studies. The Anxiety-CAT was able to differentiate 
      between mental health disorders in a similar manner as established 
      questionnaires. These results suggest that the Anxiety-CAT does indeed exhibit 
      the advantages expected from theory, but the results of further studies are 
      needed in order to judge its full potential for research and clinical practice.

TI  - An evaluation of a patient-reported outcomes found computerized adaptive testing 
      was efficient in assessing osteoarthritis impact.
PG  - 715-23
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluate a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire 
      that uses computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to measure the impact of 
      osteoarthritis (OA) on functioning and well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OA 
      patients completed 37 questions about the impact of OA on physical, social and 
      role functioning, emotional well-being, and vitality. Questionnaire responses 
      were calibrated and scored using item response theory, and two scores were 
      estimated: a Total-OA score based on patients' responses to all 37 questions, and 
      a simulated CAT-OA score where the computer selected and scored the five most 
      informative questions for each patient. Agreement between Total-OA and CAT-OA 
      scores was assessed using correlations. Discriminant validity of Total-OA and 
      CAT-OA scores was assessed with analysis of variance. Criterion measures included 
      OA pain and severity, patient global assessment, and missed work days. RESULTS: 
      Simulated CAT-OA and Total-OA scores correlated highly (r = 0.96). Both Total-OA 
      and simulated CAT-OA scores discriminated significantly between patients 
      differing on the criterion measures. F-statistics across criterion measures 
      ranged from 39.0 (P < .001) to 225.1 (P < .001) for the Total-OA score, and from 
      40.5 (P < .001) to 221.5 (P < .001) for the simulated CAT-OA score. CONCLUSIONS: 
      CAT methods produce valid and precise estimates of the impact of OA on 
      functioning and well-being with significant reduction in response burden.

      developments and evaluations.
PG  - 315-29
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Self-report questionnaires are widely used to measure health-related 
      quality of life (HRQOL). Ideally, such questionnaires should be adapted to the 
      individual patient and at the same time scores should be directly comparable 
      across patients. This may be achieved using computerized adaptive testing (CAT). 
      Usually, CAT is carried out for a single domain at a time. However, many HRQOL 
      domains are highly correlated. Multidimensional CAT may utilize these 
      correlations to improve measurement efficiency. We investigated the possible 
      advantages and difficulties of multidimensional CAT. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We 
      evaluated multidimensional CAT of three scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30: the 
      physical functioning, emotional functioning, and fatigue scales. Analyses 
      utilised a database with 2958 European cancer patients. RESULTS: It was possible 
      to obtain scores for the three domains with five to seven items administered 
      using multidimensional CAT that were very close to the scores obtained using all 
      12 items and with no or little loss of measurement precision. CONCLUSION: The 
      findings suggest that multidimensional CAT may significantly improve measurement 
      precision and efficiency and encourage further research into multidimensional 
      CAT. Particularly, the estimation of the model underlying the multidimensional 
      CAT and the conceptual aspects need further investigations.

TI  - Objective measurement of knee extension force based on computer adaptive testing.
PG  - 41-8
AB  - False impairment is encountered when tested subjects either unintentionally or 
      deliberately put an artificial upper limit on their force, in which case their 
      true capacity cannot be disclosed in a straight forward measurement. The aim of 
      this study was to develop a computer adaptive testing (CAT) system for directing 
      subjects into generating greater forces than they intended. The system was tested 
      on eleven cooperative female subjects who volunteered to take part in this study. 
      The CAT consisted of interactive testing cycles, each containing a series of 
      isometric tasks of differing intensities. While fulfilling these tasks, the 
      tested subjects were asked to take care not to exceed a self-selected upper force 
      limit (F(ssl)) that they were previously trained to memorize (order of 40% of the 
      maximal voluntary contraction). Visual feedback, displaying the applied force 
      exertions, was provided to the tested subjects but was modified by re-scaling the 
      display in an un-anticipated manner. To confirm the subject's ability to remember 
      her F(ssl), repeatability of joint memory was tested one week after the CAT. The 
      CAT results were successful in causing ten out of the eleven tested participants 
      to exert a higher force than they intended to. Additionally, the CAT algorithm 
      caused a statistically significant higher force than the repeatability test. 
      These results demonstrate the potential of CAT methods in improving the clinical 
      evaluation of muscle strength, particularly in those cases where the subject's 
      cooperation is not sufficient.

TI  - Data-adaptive test statistics for microarray data.
PG  - ii108-14
AB  - MOTIVATION: An important task in microarray data analysis is the selection of 
      genes that are differentially expressed between different tissue samples, such as 
      healthy and diseased. However, microarray data contain an enormous number of 
      dimensions (genes) and very few samples (arrays), a mismatch which poses 
      fundamental statistical problems for the selection process that have defied easy 
      resolution. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a novel approach to the selection 
      of differentially expressed genes in which test statistics are learned from data 
      using a simple notion of reproducibility in selection results as the learning 
      criterion. Reproducibility, as we define it, can be computed without any 
      knowledge of the 'ground-truth', but takes advantage of certain properties of 
      microarray data to provide an asymptotically valid guide to expected loss under 
      the true data-generating distribution. We are therefore able to indirectly 
      minimize expected loss, and obtain results substantially more robust than 
      conventional methods. We apply our method to simulated and oligonucleotide array 
      data. AVAILABILITY: By request to the corresponding author.

TI  - Adaptive statistical analysis following sample size modification based on interim 
      review of effect size.
PG  - 693-706
AB  - In designing a comparative clinical trial, the required sample size is a function 
      of the effect size, the value of which is unknown and at best may be estimated 
      from historical data. Insufficiency in sample size as a result of overestimating 
      the effect size can be destructive to the success of the clinical trial. Sample 
      size re-estimation may need to be properly considered as a part of clinical trial 
      planning. This paper is intended to give the motivations for the sample size 
      re-estimation based partly on the effect size observed at an interim analysis and 
      for a resulting simple adaptive test strategy. The performance of this adaptive 
      design strategy is assessed by comparing it with a fixed maximum sample size 
      design that is properly adjusted in anticipation of the possible sample size 
      adjustment.

TI  - Simulated computerized adaptive tests for measuring functional status were 
      efficient with good discriminant validity in patients with hip, knee, or 
      foot/ankle impairments.
PG  - 629-38
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To develop computerized adaptive tests (CATs) designed 
      to assess lower extremity functional status (FS) in people with lower extremity 
      impairments using items from the Lower Extremity Functional Scale and compare 
      discriminant validity of FS measures generated using all items analyzed with a 
      rating scale Item Response Theory model (theta(IRT)) and measures generated using 
      the simulated CATs (theta(CAT)). METHODS: Secondary analysis of retrospective 
      intake rehabilitation data. RESULTS: Unidimensionality of items was strong, and 
      local independence of items was adequate. Differential item functioning (DIF) 
      affected item calibration related to body part, that is, hip, knee, or 
      foot/ankle, but DIF did not affect item calibration for symptom acuity, gender, 
      age, or surgical history. Therefore, patients were separated into three body part 
      specific groups. The rating scale model fit all three data sets well. Three body 
      part specific CATs were developed: each was 70% more efficient than using all 
      LEFS items to estimate FS measures. theta(IRT) and theta(CAT) measures 
      discriminated patients by symptom acuity, age, and surgical history in similar 
      ways. theta(CAT) measures were as precise as theta(IRT) measures. CONCLUSION: 
      Body part-specific simulated CATs were efficient and produced precise measures of 
      FS with good discriminant validity.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in nephrology research and clinical practice.
PG  - 82-90
AB  - Physical, psychosocial, and lifestyle disturbances, along with physical and 
      emotional symptoms, have been shown to impact the health-related quality of life 
      (HRQOL) of those dependent on renal replacement therapy. The value of HRQOL 
      measurement as a tool to improve clinical care has been recognized by patients, 
      clinical investigators, and health care providers. The potential importance of 
      HRQOL assessment lies in the additional information it provides and the impact it 
      has on the clinical decision-making process between a patient and a physician. 
      There remain a multitude of challenges facing renal providers who wish to 
      incorporate HRQOL measurement to improve patient care. These challenges include 
      the clinician's understanding of the conceptual model of HRQOL, the quality of 
      the scientific process that contributed to the current literature on HRQOL, a 
      willingness of the clinician to incorporate HRQOL information into clinical 
      practice, and the logistic difficulties of collecting and applying HRQOL data in 
      a busy practice setting. Arguably, optimizing HRQOL may be the most substantial 
      impact the health care team will have on the person with kidney failure. In order 
      to implement HRQOL assessment at the point of care, providers may consider using 
      computer adaptive testing and scoring algorithms using item response theory, 
      which will allow adequate reliability for interpretation of change among 
      individuals. Moreover, the effective assessment and interpretation of HRQOL will 
      be aided by continued publication of norms, outcomes of randomized controlled 
      trials, and continued experience of investigators and clinicians.

TI  - A multistage testing strategy for detection of quantitative trait Loci affecting 
      disease resistance in Atlantic salmon.
PG  - 851-8
AB  - A multistage testing strategy to detect QTL for resistance to infectious salmon 
      anemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon is proposed. First, genotyping of amplified 
      fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) 
      were carried out using dead offspring from a disease resistance challenge test. 
      Second, AFLP genotyping among survivors followed by a Mendelian segregation test 
      was performed. Third, within-family survival analyses using all offspring were 
      developed and applied to significant TDT markers with Mendelian inheritance. 
      Maximum-likelihood methodology was developed for TDT with dominant markers to 
      exploit linkage disequilibrium within families. The strategy was tested with two 
      full-sib families of Atlantic salmon sired by the same male and consisting of 79 
      offspring in total. All dead offspring from the two families were typed for 64 
      primer combinations, resulting in 340 scored markers. There were 26 significant 
      results out of 401 TDTs using dead offspring. In the second stage, only 17 marker 
      families showed Mendelian segregation and were tested in survival analysis. A 
      permutation test was performed for all survival analyses to compute 
      experimentwise P-values. Two markers, aaccac356 and agccta150, were significant 
      at P < 0.05 when accounting for multiple testing in the survival analyses. The 
      proposed strategy might be more powerful than current mapping strategies because 
      it reduces the number of tests to be performed in the last testing stage.

TI  - The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System: 
      properties, applications, and interpretation.
PG  - 79
AB  - The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System 
      is a collection of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires targeted 
      to the management of chronic illness. The measurement system, under development 
      since 1987, began with the creation of a generic CORE questionnaire called the 
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). The FACT-G (now in 
      Version 4) is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into four 
      primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional 
      Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. It is appropriate for use with patients 
      with any form of cancer, and extensions of it have been used and validated in 
      other chronic illness condition (e.g., HIV/AIDS; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's 
      disease; rheumatoid arthritis), and in the general population. The FACIT 
      Measurement System now includes over 400 questions, some of which have been 
      translated into more than 45 languages. Assessment of any one patient is tailored 
      so that the most-relevant questions are asked and administration time for any one 
      assessment is usually less than 15 minutes. This is accomplished both by the use 
      of specific subscales for relevant domains of HRQOL, or computerized adaptive 
      testing (CAT) of selected symptoms and functional areas. FACIT questionnaires can 
      be administered by self-report (paper or computer) or interview (face-to-face or 
      telephone). Available scoring, normative data and information on meaningful 
      change now allow one to interpret results in the context of a growing literature 
      base.

TI  - The feasibility of applying item response theory to measures of migraine impact: 
      a re-analysis of three clinical studies.
PG  - 887-902
AB  - BACKGROUND: Item response theory (IRT) is a powerful framework for analyzing 
      multiitem scales and is central to the implementation of computerized adaptive 
      testing. OBJECTIVES: To explain the use of IRT to examine measurement properties 
      and to apply IRT to a questionnaire for measuring migraine impact--the Migraine 
      Specific Questionnaire (MSQ). METHODS: Data from three clinical studies that 
      employed the MSQ-version 1 were analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis for 
      categorical data and by IRT modeling. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses 
      showed very high correlations between the factors hypothesized by the original 
      test constructions. Further, high item loadings on one common factor suggest that 
      migraine impact may be adequately assessed by only one score. IRT analyses of the 
      MSQ were feasible and provided several suggestions as to how to improve the items 
      and in particular the response choices. Out of 15 items, 13 showed adequate fit 
      to the IRT model. In general, IRT scores were strongly associated with the scores 
      proposed by the original test developers and with the total item sum score. 
      Analysis of response consistency showed that more than 90% of the patients 
      answered consistently according to a unidimensional IRT model. For the remaining 
      patients, scores on the dimension of emotional function were less strongly 
      related to the overall IRT scores that mainly reflected role limitations. Such 
      response patterns can be detected easily using response consistency indices. 
      Analysis of test precision across score levels revealed that the MSQ was most 
      precise at one standard deviation worse than the mean impact level for migraine 
      patients that are not in treatment. Thus, gains in test precision can be achieved 
      by developing items aimed at less severe levels of migraine impact. CONCLUSIONS: 
      IRT proved useful for analyzing the MSQ. The approach warrants further testing in 
      a more comprehensive item pool for headache impact that would enable computerized 
      adaptive testing.

PG  - 783-91
LID - 10.1586/14737167.3.6.783 [doi]
AB  - Identifying health-related quality of life concerns is a priority when caring for 
      people with cancer. Specific problem areas such as pain, fatigue, emotional 
      distress, disease- and treatment-related symptoms, as well as physical 
      functioning can be routinely assessed using applications that draw upon item 
      response theory. Item response theory measurement models can improve on the 
      classical approach to health-related quality of life assessment with advantages 
      that include comparison of patients across diverse instruments, flexibility in 
      degree of precision desired, availability of multiple short forms, interval 
      measurement and capability for individual assessment (real-time clinical 
      monitoring) using computerized adaptive testing. This review describes a model of 
      health-related quality of life in oncology and the contribution of item response 
      theory to assessment using that model.

TI  - Continuing challenges for computer-based neuropsychological tests.
PG  - 479-89
AB  - A number of issues critical to the development of computer-based 
      neuropsychological testing systems that remain continuing challenges to their 
      widespread use in occupational and environmental health are reviewed. Several 
      computer-based neuropsychological testing systems have been developed over the 
      last 20 years, and they have contributed substantially to the study of neurologic 
      effects of a number of environmental exposures. However, many are no longer 
      supported and do not run on contemporary personal computer operating systems. 
      Issues that are continuing challenges for development of computer-based 
      neuropsychological tests in environmental and occupational health are discussed: 
      (1) some current technological trends that generally make test development more 
      difficult; (2) lack of availability of usable speech recognition of the type 
      required for computer-based testing systems; (3) implementing computer-based 
      procedures and tasks that are improvements over, not just adaptations of, their 
      manually-administered predecessors; (4) implementing tests of a wider range of 
      memory functions than the limited range now available; (5) paying more attention 
      to motivational influences that affect the reliability and validity of 
      computer-based measurements; and (6) increasing the usability of and audience for 
      computer-based systems. Partial solutions to some of these challenges are 
      offered. The challenges posed by current technological trends are substantial and 
      generally beyond the control of testing system developers. Widespread acceptance 
      of the "tablet PC" and implementation of accurate small vocabulary, discrete, 
      speaker-independent speech recognition would enable revolutionary improvements to 
      computer-based testing systems, particularly for testing memory functions not 
      covered in existing systems. Dynamic, adaptive procedures, particularly ones 
      based on item-response theory (IRT) and computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) 
      methods, will be implemented in new tests that will be more efficient, reliable, 
      and valid than existing test procedures. These additional developments, along 
      with implementation of innovative reporting formats, are necessary for more 
      widespread acceptance of the testing systems.

TI  - Virtual reality as assessment tool in psychology.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - Virtual environments (VEs), offering a new human-computer interaction paradigm, 
      have attracted much attention, in clinical psychology, especially in the 
      treatment of phobias. However, a possible new application of VR in psychology is 
      as assessment tool: VEs can be considered as an highly sophisticated form of 
      adaptive testing. This chapter describes the context of current psychological 
      assessment and underlines possible advantages of a VR based assessment tool. The 
      chapter also details the characteristics of BIVRS, Body Image Virtual Reality 
      Scale, an assessment tool designed to assess cognitive and affective components 
      of body image. It consists of a non-immersive 3D graphical interface through 
      which the patient is able to choose between 9 figures of different size which 
      vary in size from underweight to overweight. The software was developed in two 
      architectures, the first (A) running on a single user desktop computer equipped 
      with a standard virtual reality development software and the second (B) splitted 
      into a server (B1) accessible via Internet and actually running the same virtual 
      ambient as in (A) and a VRML client (B2) so that anyone can access the 
      application.

TI  - Comparability and validity of computerized adaptive testing with the MMPI-2.
PG  - 358-71
AB  - The comparability and validity of a computerized adaptive (CA) Minnesota 
      Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) were assessed in a sample of 571 
      undergraduate college students. The CA MMPI-2 administered adaptively Scales L, E 
      the 10 clinical scales, and the 15 content scales, utilizing the countdown method 
      (Butcher, Keller, & Bacon, 1985). All subjects completed the MMPI-2 twice, with 
      three experimental conditions: booklet test-retest, booklet-CA, and conventional 
      computerized (CC)-CA. Profiles across administration modalities show a high 
      degree of similarity, providing evidence for the comparability of the three 
      forms. Correlations between MMPI-2 scales and other psychometric measures (Beck 
      Depression Inventory; Symptom Checklist-Revised; State-Trait Anxiety and Anger 
      Scales; and the Anger Expression Scale) support the validity of the CA MMPI-2. 
      Substantial item savings may be realized with the implementation of the countdown 
      procedure.
