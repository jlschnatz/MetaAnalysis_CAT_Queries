abstract="The Musical Emotion Discrimination Task (MEDT) is a short, non-adaptive test of the ability to discriminate emotions in music. Test-takers hear two performances of the same melody, both played by the same performer but each trying to communicate a different basic emotion, and are asked to determine which one is ``happier'', for example. The goal of the current study was to construct a new version of the MEDT using a larger set of shorter, more diverse music clips and an adaptive framework to expand the ability range for which the test can deliver measurements. The first study analysed responses from a large sample of participants (={\thinspace}624) to determine how musical features contributed to item difficulty, which resulted in a quantitative model of musical emotion discrimination ability rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT). This model informed the construction of the adaptive MEDT. A second study contributed preliminary evidence for the validity and reliability of the adaptive MEDT, and demonstrated that the new version of the test is suitable for a wider range of abilities. This paper therefore presents the first adaptive musical emotion discrimination test, a new resource for investigating emotion processing which is freely available for research use.",

abstract="Speech comprehension counts as a benchmark outcome of cochlear implants (CIs)-disregarding the communicative importance of efficient integration of audiovisual (AV) socio-emotional information. We investigated effects of time-synchronized facial information on vocal emotion recognition (VER). In Experiment 1, 26 CI users and normal-hearing (NH) individuals classified emotions for auditory-only, AV congruent, or AV incongruent utterances. In Experiment 2, we compared crossmodal effects between groups with adaptive testing, calibrating auditory difficulty via voice morphs from emotional caricatures to anti-caricatures. CI users performed lower than NH individuals, and VER was correlated with life quality. Importantly, they showed larger benefits to VER with congruent facial emotional information even at equal auditory-only performance levels, suggesting that their larger crossmodal benefits result from deafness-related compensation rather than degraded acoustic representations. Crucially, vocal caricatures enhanced CI users' VER. Findings advocate AV stimuli during CI rehabilitation and suggest perspectives of caricaturing for both perceptual trainings and sound processor technology.",

abstract="The replacement of existing technology or the introduction of novel technology into the day-to-day routines of higher education institutions is not a trivial task. Currently, many higher education institutions are faced with the challenge of replacing existing procedures for administering written exams with e-exams. To guide this process, this paper proposes the novel technology-based exams acceptance model (TEAM) and empirically evaluates its model structure and usefulness from the perspective of higher education teachers. The model can be used to guide the transition from paper-based exams to e-exams and the implementation of innovative (e.g., adaptive) e-exam formats. The model includes perceived usefulness, computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, prior experience, facilitating conditions, and subjective norm as predictors of the behavioral intention to use e-exams. To test the model empirically, the responses of 992 teachers at 63 German universities to a standardized online questionnaire were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The model fit was acceptable. With 77{\%} (conventional e-exams) and 82{\%} (adaptive e-exams), a large proportion of the variance of the intention to use these types of exams was explained. With TEAM, a highly predictive model for explaining the behavioral intention to use e-exams is now available. It offers a theoretical basis that can be used for the successful implementation of e-exams in higher education.",

abstract="A condition-specific instrument (EA-QOL{\textcopyright}) to assess quality of life of children born with esophageal atresia (EA) was developed in Sweden and Germany. Before implementing this in the Netherlands, we evaluated its psychometric performance in Dutch children. After Swedish-Dutch translation, cognitive debriefing was conducted with a subset of EA patients and their parents. Next, feasibility, reliability, and validity were evaluated in a nationwide field test. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the predefined concepts, although some questions were not generally applicable. Feasibility was poor to moderate. In 2-to-7-year-old children, 8/17 items had {\&}gt;5{\%} missing values. In 8-to-17-year-old children, this concerned 3/24 items of the proxy-report and 5/14 items of the self-report. The internal reliability was good. The retest reliability showed good correlation. The comparison reliability between self-reports and proxy-reports was strong. The construct validity was discriminative. The convergent validity was strong for the 2-to-7-year-old proxy-report, and weak to moderate for the 8-to-17-year-old proxy-report and self-report. In conclusion, the Dutch-translated EA-QOL questionnaires showed good reliability and validity. Feasibility was likely affected by items not deemed applicable to an individual child's situation. Computer adaptive testing could be a potential solution to customizing the questionnaire to the individual patient. Furthermore, cross-cultural validation studies and implementation-evaluation studies in different countries are needed.",

journal="The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology",
year="2022",
month="Oct",
day="26",
abstract="Computerized adaptive testing for cognitive diagnosis (CD-CAT) needs to be efficient and responsive in real time to meet practical applications' requirements. For high-dimensional data, the number of categories to be recognized in a test grows exponentially as the number of attributes increases, which can easily cause system reaction time to be too long such that it adversely affects the examinees and thus seriously impacts the measurement efficiency. More importantly, the long-time CPU operations and memory usage of item selection in CD-CAT due to intensive computation are impractical and cannot wholly meet practice needs. This paper proposed two new efficient selection strategies (HIA and CEL) for high-dimensional CD-CAT to address this issue by incorporating the max-marginals from the maximum a posteriori query and integrating the ensemble learning approach into the previous efficient selection methods, respectively. The performance of the proposed selection method was compared with the conventional selection method using simulated and real item pools. The results showed that the proposed methods could significantly improve the measurement efficiency with about 1/2-1/200 of the conventional methods' computation time while retaining similar measurement accuracy. With increasing number of attributes and size of the item pool, the computation time advantage of the proposed methods becomes more significant.",

abstract="Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are questionnaires completed by patients about aspects of their health status. They are a vital part of learning health systems as they are the primary source of information about important outcomes that are best assessed by patients such as pain, disability, anxiety and depression. The volume of questions can easily become burdensome. Previous techniques reduced this burden by dynamically selecting questions from question item banks which are specifically built for different latent constructs being measured. These techniques analyzed the information function between each question in the item bank and the measured construct based on item response theory then used this information function to dynamically select questions by computerized adaptive testing. Here we extend those ideas by using Bayesian Networks (BNs) to enable Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) for efficient and accurate question selection on widely-used existing PROMs. BNs offer more comprehensive probabilistic models of the connections between different PROM questions, allowing the use of information theoretic techniques to select the most informative questions. We tested our methods using five clinical PROM datasets, demonstrating that answering a small subset of questions selected with CAT has similar predictions and error to answering all questions in the PROM BN. Our results show that answering 30{\%} - 75{\%} questions selected with CAT had an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 (min: 0.8 - max: 0.98) for predicting the measured constructs. BNs outperformed alternative CAT approaches with a 5{\%} (min: 0.01{\%} - max: 9{\%}) average increase in the accuracy of predicting the responses to unanswered question items.",

abstract="COVID-19 prompted distress and increased reliance on digital mental health interventions, which previously demonstrated low rates of retention and adherence. This single-arm trial evaluated whether self-guided, web-based, positive affect regulation skills (PARK) were engaging and associated with changes in well-being during the pandemic. Over 6 weeks, PARK delivers brief lessons and practices in skills designed to increase positive emotions: noticing positive events, savoring, gratitude, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, and self-compassion. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests of anxiety, depression, social isolation, positive affect, and meaning and purpose were administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months after baseline. Retention and usage of PARK were measured by the web-based assessment and intervention platforms. The sample ( = 616) was predominantly female, non-Hispanic, white, and well-educated. Of those who completed baseline, only 42{\%} completed a follow-up assessment; 30{\%} never logged into PARK. Among those who did, 86{\%} used at least one skill, but only 14{\%} completed PARK. Across retention and usage metrics, older age predicted more engagement. In multivariable models, people of color and people with greater baseline anxiety were more likely to complete PARK. All well-being indicators improved over time, with greater improvements in anxiety and social isolation among participants who accessed at least one PARK skill compared to those who did not. Retention and usage rates mirrored pre-pandemic trends, but within this select sample, predictors of engagement differed from prior research. Findings underscore the need for additional efforts to ensure equitable access to digital mental health interventions and research. Trials registration: NCT04367922.",

Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment investigated the SEC's feasibility, as well as its sensitivity and specificity for detecting childhood hearing loss with a monaural adaptive test procedure. In the second experiment, the SEC sounds, noise, and test format were adapted based on the findings of the first experiment. The adaptations were combined with three test procedures, one similar to the one used in Experiment 1, one presenting the sounds dichotically in diotic noise, and one presenting all the sounds with a fixed signal-to-noise ratio and a stopping rule. Results in young children show high sensitivity and specificity to detect different grades of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (70-90{\%}). When using an adaptive, monaural procedure, the test duration was approximately 6 min, and 17{\%} of the results obtained were unreliable. Adaptive staircase analyses showed that the unreliable results probably occur due to attention/motivation loss. The test duration could be reduced to 3-4 min with adapted test formats without decreasing the test-retest reliability. The unreliable test results could be reduced from 17{\%} to as low as 5{\%}. However, dichotic presentation requires longer training, reducing the dichotic test format's feasibility.",

abstract="Our understanding of longitudinal outcomes of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) survivors is limited by the heterogeneity of follow-up intervals, populations, and outcomes assessed. We sought to demonstrate (1) the feasibility of longitudinal multidimensional outcome assessment and (2) methods to promote cohort retention. The objective of this presented study was to provide details of follow-up methodology in a PICU survivor cohort and not to present the outcomes at long-term follow-up for this cohort. We enrolled 152 children aged 0 to 17 years admitted to the PICU in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. We examined resource utilization, family impact of critical illness, and neurodevelopment using the PICU Outcomes Portfolio (POP) Survey which included a study-specific survey and validated tools: 1. Functional Status Scale, 2. Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test, 3. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 4. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and 5. Vanderbilt Assessment Scales for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder. POP Survey completion rates were 89{\%}, 78{\%}, and 84{\%} at 1, 3, and 6 months. Follow-up rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 80{\%}, 55{\%}, and 43{\%}. Implementing a longitudinal multidimensional outcome portfolio for PICU survivors is feasible within an urban, tertiary-care, academic hospital. Our attrition after one year demonstrates the long-term follow-up challenges in this population. Our findings inform ongoing efforts to implement core outcome sets after pediatric critical illness.",

abstract="Children with an advanced knowledge of emotions are generally more socially competent, less likely to suffer from psychopathology, and more likely to succeed in school, both socially and academically. The assessment of children's emotion knowledge has thus gained importance in recent decades - both in psychiatric practice and in developmental and educational psychology. However, there is still a lack of appropriate instruments for assessing children's emotion knowledge in a performance test reliably, and for a broad age range. The Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge (ATEM 3-9) is a newly developed measure which encompasses seven components of emotion knowledge in 3-9-year-olds. The ATEM 3-9 is an adaptive test which uses skip and dropout rules to adjust for children's varying levels of knowledge. In addition to German, the ATEM has been translated into English and Hebrew. The German norming sample of the ATEM 3-9 comprises  = 882 (54{\%} female, 21{\%} bilingual) children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, who were divided into seven age groups. Test items, which are ordered according to the item response theory, showed a good fit to a seven-dimensional model reflecting the seven components. The internal consistencies of the dimensions are acceptable to good. Construct validity was examined by means of correlations with other measures of emotion knowledge, as well as measures on language skills and executive functions in a subsample. This resulted in medium size correlations in the expected directions. In addition, children with externalizing and internalizing disorders who were recruited in psychiatric in- and outpatient clinics showed deficits in various components of emotion knowledge when compared to their agemates in the norming sample. Overall, the ATEM 3-9 is well suited to measure individual components of emotion knowledge in children and to obtain a differentiated picture of the various aspects of emotion knowledge. The ATEM 3-9 thus supports the investigation of the development of social-emotional competencies in normative development (e.g., school readiness) and in social-emotional-learning interventions. Furthermore, it is suitable as an instrument for the differentiated assessment of (progress of) children's emotion knowledge in clinical child psychology and psychiatry.",

abstract="To efficiently obtain information about both the general abilities and detailed cognitive profiles of examinees from a single model that uses a single-calibration process, higher-order cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) that employ higher-order cognitive diagnostic models have been developed. However, the current item selection methods used in higher-order CD-CAT adaptively select items according to only the attribute profiles, which might lead to low precision regarding general abilities; hence, an appropriate method was proposed for this CAT system in this study. Under the framework of the higher-order models, the responses were affected by attribute profiles, which were governed by general abilities. It is reasonable to hold that the item responses were affected by a combination of general abilities and attribute profiles. Based on the logic of Shannon entropy and the generalized deterministic, inputs, noisy ``and'' gate (G-DINA) model discrimination index (GDI), two new item selection methods were proposed for higher-order CD-CAT by considering the above combination in this study. The simulation results demonstrated that the new methods achieved more accurate estimations of both general abilities and cognitive profiles than the existing methods and maintained distinct advantages in terms of item pool usage.",

Controlling for potential confounding in multivariable analysis we found greater activity intolerance was associated with retired work-status and greater depressive symptoms, but not with greater symptoms of anger. In addition, greater pain intensity was associated with greater symptoms of depression and greater catastrophic thinking, but not with greater symptoms of anger. Anger emotions do not contribute to symptom intensity and activity intolerance in musculoskeletal illness. Attention can be directed at addressing psychological distress and cognitive bias.",

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of CAT on motivation and anxiety in comparison to traditional fixed-item testing. Seven databases were examined. Articles were eligible if they employed an empirical study containing a direct comparison between CAT and FIT. Meta-analytical results showed no overall effect of test type on anxiety and motivation when comparing CAT with FIT ( = 11,  = 0.06,  = .28).

abstract="Measurement-informed care is a cornerstone of evidence-based practice and shared decision-making. A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient's perspective of the presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of executive function, emotional regulation, mind-wandering, and sluggish cognitive tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients. Psychometrically validated tools are available to complement every aspect of ADHD care and provide global standards for research.",

They answered 62 questions across five categories regarding their psychiatric status over the previous week. We selected 28 items that satisfied the assumptions of IRT, fitted a graded response model to these items, and performed CAT simulations. The CAT simulation used an average of 6.96 items and showed a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.916 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.899-0.931) between the degree of depression estimated by simulation and that estimated using all 28 items. The measurement precision of CAT with only four items was superior to that of the estimation using the calibrated Patient Health Questionnaire-9. These results imply that this scale is useful and accurate for measuring depression in patients with cancer.",

abstract="We congratulate Dr. Nigel Stallard on his stimulating paper on adaptive enrichment designs with a continuous biomarker. Dr. Stallard details a framework for a large and interesting class of enrichment procedures. His work has motivated us to offer some thoughts in response. Dr. Stallard's strategy is to use the maximum of a test statistic over a set of possible threshold values to define the enriched population to be sampled in a second stage. This reminds us of procedures for identifying a change point, a biomarker value beyond which the effect of treatment is increased. For simplicity we focus our comments on Dr. Stallard's Rule 1 for selecting the second-stage sampling threshold. Using this rule, we present the likelihood ratio approach for adaptive testing and compare it to Dr. Stallard's approach for a few scenarios.",

We aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatric measure for itch symptoms and itch impact, defined as the effect specifically of itch on physical, mental, and social health, all of which can affect life quality. After literature review, concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with parents and children with itch, and repeated content-expert review, an item pool was generated and refined. The pool was calibrated with data from 499 children with pruritus using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, item response theory, and item fit analysis. The resultant 45-item bank, PROMIS Itch Questionnaire-Child (PIQ-C), showed good convergent and discriminant validity in 181 children aged 8‒17 years, discriminating children with different levels of severity, and was responsive to change. Strong correlations (rho ≥ 0.60) were observed with pain and sleep measures, and moderate correlations were observed with other pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Itch Questionnaire-Child comprehensively measures itch intensity and burden, providing an itch-specific alternative for assessing life quality. The independent calibration of each item/question allows for flexibility in generating short forms or computerized adaptive testing for efficient use in research and office practice.",

abstract="Nondestructive magnetic measurement methods can be successfully applied to determine the embrittlement of nuclear pressure vessel steel caused by neutron irradiation. It was found in previous works that reasonable correlation could be obtained between the nondestructively measured magnetic parameters and destructively determined ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. However, a large scatter of the measurement points was detected even in the cases of the non-irradiated reference samples. The reason for their scattering was attributed to the local inhomogeneity of material. This conclusion is verified in the present work by applying three different magnetic methods on two sets of Charpy samples made of two different reactor steel materials. It was found that by an optimal magnetic pre-selection of samples, a good, linear correlation can be found between magnetic parameters as well as the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature with low scattering of points. This result shows that neutron irradiation embrittlement depends very much on the local material properties.",

abstract="We evaluated construct validity, responsiveness, and utility of change indicators of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS adult v1.0 item banks for Depression and Anxiety administered as computerized adaptive test (CAT). Specifically, the CATs were compared to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) using pre- and re-test data of adult patients treated for common mental disorders ( = 400; median pre-to-re-test interval = 215 days). Construct validity was evaluated with Pearson's correlations and Cohen's s; responsiveness with Pearson's correlations and pre-post effect sizes (); utility of change indicators with kappa coefficients and percentages of (dis)agreement. The results showed that the PROMIS CATs measure similar constructs as matching BSI scales. Under the assumption of measuring similar constructs, the CAT and BSI Depression scales were similarly responsive. For the Anxiety scales, we found a higher responsiveness for CAT ( = 0.64) compared to the BSI ( = 0.50). Finally, both CATs categorized the change scores of more patients as changed compared to matching BSI scales, indicating that the PROMIS CATs may be more able to detect actual change than the BSI. Based on these findings, the PROMIS CATs may be considered a modest improvement over matching BSI scales as tools for reviewing treatment progress with patients. We discuss several additional differences between the PROMIS CATs and the BSI to help test users choose instruments. These differences include the adopted measurement theory (Item Response Theory vs. Classical Test Theory), the mode of administration (CAT vs. fixed items), and the area of application (universal vs. predominantly clinical).

This study aimed to 1) examine if PROMIS measures administered via computer adaptive testing (CAT) were responsive to change, and 2) highlight one method of assessing clinically significant change for youth seen in a tertiary pain clinic. Clinically significant change was achieved if patients had significantly reliable pre-to-post-changes greater than Reliable Change Index (RCI) value and reported decreased symptoms by at least one severity level (e.g., moderate to mild). Participants were 328 youth (8-17 years old) seen in a tertiary pediatric pain management clinic. Small to moderate effect sizes were noted across PROMIS measures (except Peer Relations). Reliable magnitudes of change were estimated for this sample as approximately 6 point reduction for Pain Interference and Mobility, 9 for Fatigue, and 11 for Anxiety and Depression. Depending on the measure, 10 to 24{\%} were categorized as improved, 3 to 6{\%} as deteriorated, and 68 to 81{\%} were either not clinically elevated at baseline or remained unchanged at 3 months. Overall, PROMIS CAT measures demonstrated responsiveness to change over time. Estimation of clinically significant change offers preliminary yet rigorous benchmarks for evaluating treatment response and sets the stage for understanding treatment effects. PERSPECTIVE: This study assesses responsiveness of CAT administered PROMIS measures and highlights one methodological approach of presenting clinical significance for assessing treatment outcomes in pediatric chronic pain. These benchmarks will allow clinicians and researchers to evaluate treatment response utilizing PROs while allowing for a deeper understanding of treatment effects.",

abstract="Pediatric burn injuries can alter the trajectory of the survivor's entire life. Patient-centered outcome measures are helpful to assess unique physical and psychosocial needs and long-term recovery. This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework to measure pediatric burn outcomes in survivors aged 5 to 12 years as a part of the School-Aged Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation Computer Adaptive Test (SA-LIBRE5-12 CAT) development. This study conducted a systematic literature review guided by the WHO International Classification of Functioning-Child and Youth and domains in the American Burn Association/Shriners Hospitals for Children Burn Outcomes Questionnaire5-18. Interviews with eight parents and seven clinicians were conducted to identify important domains in child recovery. One clinician focus group with four clinicians was completed to identify gaps in the preliminary framework, and semiweekly expert consensus meetings were conducted with three experts to solidify the framework. Qualitative data were analyzed by grounded theory methodology. Three major thematic outcome domains emerged: 1) Physical Functioning: fine motor and upper extremity, gross motor and lower extremity, pain, skin symptoms, sleep and fatigue, and physical resilience; 2) Psychological Functioning: cognitive, behavioral, emotional, resilience, and body image; and 3) Family and Social Functioning: family relationships, and parental satisfaction, school, peer relations, and community participation. The framework will be used to develop item banks for a CAT-based assessment of school-aged children's health and developmental outcomes, which will be designed for clinical and research use to optimize interventions, personalize care, and improve long-term health outcomes for burned children.",

abstract="Geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures have been used extensively in recent decades due to their significant advantages over more conventional earth retaining structures, including the cost-effectiveness, reduced construction time, and possibility of using locally-available lower quality soils and/or waste materials, such as recycled construction and demolition (C{\&}D) wastes. The time-dependent shear behaviour at the interfaces between the geosynthetic and the backfill is an important factor affecting the overall long-term performance of such structures, and thereby should be properly understood. In this study, an innovative multistage direct shear test procedure is introduced to characterise the time-dependent response of the interface between a high-strength geotextile and a recycled C{\&}D material. After a prescribed shear displacement is reached, the shear box is kept stationary for a specific period of time, after which the test proceeds again, at a constant displacement rate, until the peak and large-displacement shear strengths are mobilised. The shear stress-shear displacement curves from the proposed multistage tests exhibited a progressive decrease in shear stress with time (stress relaxation) during the period in which the shear box was restrained from any movement, which was more pronounced under lower normal stress values. Regardless of the prior interface shear displacement and duration of the stress relaxation stage, the peak and residual shear strength parameters of the C{\&}D material-geotextile interface remained similar to those obtained from the conventional (benchmark) tests carried out under constant displacement rate.",

Children (N = 1,328), representative of the Dutch population, were asked to complete the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale (8-18 years) and PedsQLTM (8-17 years). A graded response model (GRM) was fit to the data. Structural validity was assessed by checking item-fit statistics (S-X2, p < .001 = misfit). For construct validity, a moderate correlation (Pearson's r > 0.50) was expected between the Anger scale and PedsQLTM EF subscale score. Dutch mean T score based on the U.S. model was calculated to provide reference data and cut-offs. Standard error of measurement (SE($\theta$)) was used to assess reliability (SE($\theta$) < .32 = .90 reliability). Relative efficiency was calculated (1 - SE($\theta$)2/N items) to compare how good the measures performed relative to the amount of items administered. In total, 527 children completed the PROMIS pediatric Anger scale, of which 482 completed the PedsQLTM. Structural validity was sufficient as no items displayed misfit (S-X2 = 22.9-40.3, p > .001). The Anger scale score correlated moderately (Pearson's r = .64) with the PedsQLTM EF subscale score. Dutch mean T score was 44.20 (SD = 11.39), with cut-offs of >52.2 for moderate and ≥62.3 for severe symptoms. Reliable measurements were obtained at the population mean and >2SD in the clinically relevant direction. CAT outperformed all other measures in efficiency. The PROMIS pediatric Anger scale displayed sufficient psychometric properties within the Dutch population and reference data are available.

abstract="Computer-adaptive tests use respondents' answers to previous questions to select the subsequent questions. They are gaining popularity for their increased measurement precision and decreased administration time compared to static questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to estimate the test-retest reliability and construct validity of the computer-adaptive test version of a participation measure, the Late Life Disability Instrument (LLDI-CAT) for people with COPD and to compare scores and administration time with those of the static LLDI. Among 76 older adults with COPD, scores on the LLDI-CAT were compared to scores on measures of related constructs, between groups based on symptom severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype, and to scores on the static LLDI. A subsample of 28 people completed the LLDI-CAT a second time within one week of the initial administration for test-retest reliability. The LLDI-CAT had very good test-retest reliability (ICC 0.88; SEM 2.74 points), fair correlations with physical function ({\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.37-0.50), anxiety (r=-0.42), and depression (r=-0.50), fair to moderately-strong correlations with quality of life ({\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.48-0.63), and strong correlation with the static LLDI limitation domain ({\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.80). The LLDI-CAT scores differed between people with different symptom severity, prognosis and frailty phenotype ({\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}0.004). The mean administration time for the LLDI-CAT was 3.3 (1.5) minutes, less than that of the static LLDI at 6.3 (2.8) minutes ({\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001). The LLDI-CAT demonstrates evidence of test-retest reliability and construct validity, and correlates well with the limitation domain of the static LLDI for people with COPD. The LLDI-CAT can be used to assess participation for this population.",

abstract="Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), tools to assess patient self-report of health status, are now increasingly used in research, care and policymaking. While there are two well-developed disease-specific PROMs for interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), many unmet and urgent needs remain. In December 2019, 64 international ILD experts convened in Erice, Italy to deliberate on many topics, including PROMs in ILD. This review summarises the history of PROMs in ILD, shortcomings of the existing tools, challenges of development, validation and implementation of their use in clinical trials, and the discussion held during the meeting. Development of disease-specific PROMs for ILD including IPF with robust methodology and validation in concordance with guidance from regulatory authorities have increased user confidence in PROMs. Minimal clinically important difference for bidirectional changes may need to be developed. Cross-cultural validation and linguistic adaptations are necessary in addition to robust psychometric properties for effective PROM use in multinational clinical trials. PROM burden of use should be reduced through appropriate use of digital technologies and computerised adaptive testing. Active patient engagement in all stages from development, testing, choosing and implementation of PROMs can help improve probability of success and further growth.",

The present study investigated longitudinal changes in anxiety and depression in a sample of perinatal non-Hispanic Black and Latina women. Categorical (yes/no) measures of positive anxiety and depression screens, as well as total symptom scores, were measured longitudinally across the perinatal period in 178 women (115 non-Hispanic Black, 63 Latina) using the CAT-MH{\texttrademark}, a computerized adaptive test. Time (up to 4 visits) and race/ethnicity effects were assessed in linear mixed effects models. Rates of positive anxiety screenings were 13.6{\%}, 3.2{\%}, 8.5{\%}, and 0{\%} in Latina women and 2.6{\%}, 4.2{\%}, 6.1{\%}, and 5.8{\%} in non-Hispanic Black women in the 1, 2, and 3 trimesters, and postpartum, respectively. Rates of positive anxiety screenings overall were highest in the first trimester (OR{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.20; 95{\%} CI 0.04-0.98), and there was a significant time-by-race/ethnicity interaction for positive anxiety screens (OR{\thinspace}={\thinspace}8.88; 95{\%} CI 1.42-55.51), as positive screens were most frequent in the first trimester and sharply declined for Latina women, while rates were relatively consistent across the perinatal period in non-Hispanic Black women. Rates of positive depression screens did not change over time, but there was a trend (OR{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1.93; 95{\%} CI 0.93-4.03) for a time-by-race/ethnicity interaction in a direction similar to that seen for anxiety. The odds of positive anxiety screens vary by race/ethnicity and trimester, suggesting that anxiety screening and anxiety interventions may be most resourcefully used in the first trimester for Latina women in particular.",

The ITACS demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with the PEDI-CAT. Children with DD had significantly more activity concerns on the ITACS than TD.

Second, 3 clinical decision support issues are highlighted: gathering PROs, electronic health record effect on providers, and incorporating PROs into clinical decision support design and implementation. Lastly, the salience of crosscutting domains as well as 9 key pragmatic decisions are reviewed. Crosscutting domains are those that are relevant across most medical and mental health conditions, such as the SPADE symptom pentad (sleep problems, pain, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue) and physical functioning. The 9 pragmatic decisions include (1) generic vs disease-specific scales; (2) single- vs multidomain scales; (3) universal scales vs user-choice selection; (4) number of domains to measure; (5) prioritization of domains when multiple domains are assessed; (6) action thresholds; (7) clinical purpose (screening vs monitoring); as well as the (8) frequency and (9) logistical aspects of PRO administration.",

abstract="Although knee and hip replacements are intended to relieve pain and improve function, up to 44{\%} of knee replacement patients and 27{\%} of hip replacement patients report persistent postoperative joint pain. Improving surgical pain management is essential. We conducted a single-site, 3-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted at an orthopedic clinic, among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) of the hip or knee. Mindfulness meditation (MM), hypnotic suggestion (HS), and cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation) were each delivered in a single, 15-minute group session as part of a 2-hour, preoperative education program. Preoperative outcomes-pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, pain medication desire, and anxiety-were measured with numeric rating scales. Postoperative physical functioning at 6-week follow-up was assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function computer adaptive test. Total joint arthroplasty patients were randomized to preoperative MM, HS, or cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (n = 285). Mindfulness meditation and HS led to significantly less preoperative pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and anxiety. Mindfulness meditation also decreased preoperative pain medication desire relative to cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation and increased postoperative physical functioning at 6-week follow-up relative to HS and cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation. Moderation analysis revealed the surgery type did not differentially impact the 3 interventions. Thus, a single session of a simple, scripted MM intervention may be able to immediately decrease TJA patients' preoperative clinical symptomology and improve postoperative physical function. As such, embedding brief MM interventions in surgical care pathways has the potential to improve surgical outcomes for the millions of patients receiving TJA each year.",

Data were collected using focus groups and face-to-face interviews. The sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically. NViVo software was used to perform qualitative analysis.: Eight focus groups and 10 interviews were conducted with 41 patients with uveitis. Seven QoL domains were identified, namely symptoms, emotional, activity limitation, health concerns, convenience, social, and economic impact. Although these QoL domains have been previously identified in other eye diseases, the sub-themes within each QoL domain were unique to uveitis. Participants described a variety of symptoms including increased light sensitivity, blurred vision, pain, redness, and tearing. Participants repeatedly described feeling frustrated due to prognostic uncertainty and associated discomfort. Participants were concerned about the frequent relapses of inflammation, as well as side-effects from long-term systemic medications. Uveitis affected their ability to perform daily tasks such as using computers, driving, and reading books. Direct financial impacts included reduced work hours and the costs of treatment and specialist care.: Participants with uveitis experience many symptoms in addition to medication-related inconveniences and activity limitations. The QoL issues identified will be used to develop a uveitis-specific QoL item bank.",

The other purpose is to examine the methods for reducing the adverse effects of calibration errors. Simulation results show that (1) calibration error has negative effect on the measurement accuracy for the deterministic input, noisy ``and'' gate (DINA) model, and the reduced reparameterized unified model; (2) the average test lengths is shorter, and the test efficiency is overestimated for items with calibration errors; (3) the compensatory reparameterized unified model (CRUM) is less affected by the calibration errors, and the classification accuracy, average test length, and test efficiency are slightly stable in the CRUM framework; (4) methods such as improving the quality of items, using large calibration sample to calibrate the parameters of items, as well as using cross-validation method can reduce the adverse effects of calibration errors on CD-CAT.",

We conducted unidimensionality testing, item response theory (IRT) model comparison and selection, and IRT item analysis including local independence, item fit, differential item functioning, and item discrimination. Sixty-three items with good psychometric properties were retained in the final CAT-ER.

abstract="A central but challenging problem in genetic studies is to test for (usually weak) associations between a complex trait (e.g., a disease status) and sets of multiple genetic variants. Due to the lack of a uniformly most powerful test, data-adaptive tests, such as the adaptive sum of powered score (aSPU) test, are advantageous in maintaining high power against a wide range of alternatives. However, there is often no closed-form to accurately and analytically calculate the p-values of many adaptive tests like aSPU, thus Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are often used, which can be time consuming to achieve a stringent significance level (e.g., 5e-8) used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To estimate such a small p-value, we need a huge number of MC simulations (e.g., 1e+10). As an alternative, we propose using importance sampling to speed up such calculations. We develop some theory to motivate a proposed algorithm for the aSPU test, and show that the proposed method is computationally more efficient than the standard MC simulations. Using both simulated and real data, we demonstrate the superior performance of the new method over the standard MC simulations.",

Adaptive testing procedures are widely used in single-session assessments for humans with diverse cognitive abilities. In this study, we designed and deployed two up-down staircase assessments for SWM in which 26 pet dogs were required to recall the location of a treat hidden behind one of two identical boxes following delays of variable length. In the first experiment, performance tended to decline with age but few dogs completed the test (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}10). However, all of the dogs that participated in the second experiment (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}24) completed the assessment and provided reliable evidence of learning and retaining the task. Delay length and age significantly predicted performance supporting the validity of this assessment. The relationships between age and performance were described by inverted U-shaped functions as both old and young dogs displayed deficits in weighted cumulative-scores and trial-by-trial performance. Thus, SWM in pet dogs may develop until midlife and decline thereafter. Exploratory analyses of non-mnemonic fixation strategies, sustained engagement, inhibitory control, and potential improvements for future SWM assessments which adopt this paradigm are also discussed.",

abstract="Recent developments in the dimensional assessment of personality functioning have made the implementation of latent measurement models increasingly attractive. In this study, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a well-established personality functioning instrument (the OPD Structure Questionnaire) to identify a unidimensional latent trait and to evaluate the feasibility of computer adaptive testing (CAT). We hypothesized that the use of IRT could reduce the test burden - compared to a fixed short form - while maintaining high precision over a wide range of the latent trait. The OPD-SQ was collected from 1235 patients in a psychosomatic clinic. IRT assumptions were fulfilled. A 9-factor model yielded sufficient fit and unidimensionality in exploratory factor analysis with bifactor rotation. Items were iteratively reduced, and a graded-response IRT model was fitted to the data. Simulations showed that a CAT with approximately 7 items was able to capture an OPD-SQ global severity score with an accuracy similar to that of a fixed 12-item short form. The final item bank and CAT yielded satisfactory content validity. Strong correlations with depression and anxiety replicated previous results on the OPD-SQ. We concluded that IRT applications could be useful to reduce the test burden of personality functioning instruments.",

abstract="An adaptive task difficulty assignment method which we reckon as balanced difficulty task finder (BDTF) is proposed in this paper. The aim is to recommend tasks to a learner using a trade-off between skills of the learner and difficulty of the tasks such that the learner experiences a state of  during the learning. Flow is a mental state that psychologists refer to when someone is completely immersed in an activity. Flow state is a multidisciplinary field of research and has been studied not only in psychology, but also neuroscience, education, sport, and games. The idea behind this paper is to try to achieve a flow state in a similar way as Elo's chess skill rating (Glickman in Am Chess J 3:59-102) and TrueSkill (Herbrich et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems, 2006) for matching game players, where ``matched players'' should possess similar capabilities and skills in order to maintain the level of motivation and involvement in the game. The BDTF draws analogy between choosing an appropriate opponent or appropriate game level and automatically choosing an appropriate difficulty level of a learning task. This method, as an intelligent tutoring system, could be used in a wide range of applications from online learning environments and e-learning, to learning and remembering techniques in traditional methods such as adjusting delayed matching to sample and spaced retrieval training that can be used for people with memory problems such as people with dementia.",

However, in domains such as patient reported outcomes, the items in a bank might all target one end of the trait continuum (e.g., negative symptoms), and the bank may lack depth for many individuals. In such cases, the  (PSER) stopping rule will stop the CAT even if the  threshold has not been reached, and can avoid administering excessive questions that provide little additional information. By tuning the parameters of the PSER algorithm, a practitioner can specify a desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency Using simulated data for the PROMIS  and  banks, we demonstrate that these parameters can substantially impact CAT performance. When the parameters were optimally tuned, the PSER stopping rule was found to outperform the  stopping rule overall and particularly for individuals not targeted by the bank, and presented roughly the same number of items across the trait continuum. Therefore, the PSER stopping rule provides an effective method for balancing the precision and efficiency of a CAT.",

abstract="Bronchiolitis is a common pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) illness and often affects generally healthy children, making it a promising disease in which to study long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We previously found that approximately 15{\%} of critical bronchiolitis patients have evidence of post-PICU morbidity using coarse definitions available in administrative data sets. In this study, we measured neurodevelopmental outcomes using four more precise tools. Children who had previously been admitted to our PICU with bronchiolitis were included; those with evidence of developmental delay at PICU admission were excluded. Approximately 1 to 2 years after PICU discharge, the parent of each subject completed two questionnaires (Ages and Stages Questionnaire and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test). Each subject also underwent two in-person assessments administered by a certified examiner (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition, and the Amiel-Tison neurological assessment). For each domain of each test, a score of{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}1 standard deviation below the norm for the subject's age defined ``moderate'' disability and a score ≥ 2 standard deviations below the norm defined ``severe'' disability. Eighteen subjects (median ages of 3.7 months at PICU admission and 2.3 years at testing) were enrolled, 17 of whom were supported by high-flow nasal cannula and/or mechanical ventilation. Fifteen children (83{\%}) scored abnormally on ≥ 1test. Eight children (44{\%}) had disabilities in ≥ 3 domains and/or ≥ 1 severe disability identified. Our findings that motor, language, and cognitive disabilities are commonly observed months to years after critical bronchiolitis require larger studies to confirm this finding, assess causality, and identify modifiable risk factors.",

abstract="Approximately one-fourth of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases are associated with a disruptive genetic variant. Many of these ASD genotypes have been described previously, and are characterized by unique constellations of medical, psychiatric, developmental, and behavioral features. Development of precision medicine care for affected individuals has been challenging due to the phenotypic heterogeneity that exists even within each genetic subtype. In the present study, we identify developmental milestones that predict cognitive and adaptive outcomes for five of the most common ASD genotypes. Sixty-five youth with a known pathogenic variant involving ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A genes participated in cognitive and adaptive testing. Exploratory linear regressions were used to identify developmental milestones that predicted cognitive and adaptive outcomes within each gene group. We hypothesized that the earliest and most predictive milestones would vary across gene groups, but would be consistent across outcomes within each genetic subtype. Within the ADNP group, age of walking predicted cognitive outcomes, while age of first words predicted adaptive behaviors. Age of phrases predicted adaptive functioning in the CHD8 group, but cognitive outcomes were not clearly associated with early developmental milestones. Verbal milestones were the strongest predictors of cognitive and adaptive outcomes for individuals with mutations to DYRK1A, GRIN2B, or SCN2A. These trends inform decisions about treatment planning and long-term expectations for affected individuals, and they add to the growing body of research linking molecular genetic function to brain development and phenotypic outcomes. LAY SUMMARY: Researchers have found many genetic causes of autism including mutations to ADNP, CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, and SCN2A genes. We found that each genetic cause had different early developmental milestones that explained the overall functioning of the children when they were older. Depending on the genetic cause, the age that a child first starts walking and/or talking may help to better understand and support a child's development who has a mutation to one of the above genes.

Results showed that the optimal item pools built with the -optimality method provide sufficient measurement accuracy under all simulated MST panel designs.

The variables in the model were as follows: questionnaire (families' socioeconomic status [SES]), children's functioning (The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test [PEDI-CAT]); hours of care (daily diaries), number of adaptations used, and help with child care (parents' report). Distinct variable combinations explained 78{\%} of the variation in the time to care (TD model), followed by 42{\%} (ASD) and 29{\%} (CP). Adaptations indirectly affected time to care through its effect on functioning (CP); family's SES affected functioning through its effect on adaptation use (ASD).

abstract="Many genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are associated with multiple, sometimes seemingly unrelated, traits. This motivates multi-trait association analyses, which have successfully identified novel associated loci for many complex diseases. While appealing, most existing methods focus on analyzing a relatively small number of traits, and may yield inflated Type 1 error rates when a large number of traits need to be analyzed jointly. As deep phenotyping data are becoming rapidly available, we develop a novel method, referred to as aMAT (adaptive multi-trait association test), for multi-trait analysis of any number of traits. We applied aMAT to GWAS summary statistics for a set of 58 volumetric imaging derived phenotypes from the UK Biobank. aMAT had a genomic inflation factor of 1.04, indicating the Type 1 error rate was well controlled. More important, aMAT identified 24 distinct risk loci, 13 of which were ignored by standard GWAS. In comparison, the competing methods either had a suspicious genomic inflation factor or identified much fewer risk loci. Finally, four additional sets of traits have been analyzed and provided similar conclusions.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the construct validity of the PiCD using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) and the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorders Static Form (CAT-PD-SF). We administered these tests to 328 college students (150 males, 178 females). We found that the PiCD had adequate internal consistency reliability. Correlations between scores from the PiCD scales and the criterion measures generally indicated adequate discriminant validity. Along the same lines, convergent validity was adequate for the PiCD Negative Affective, Disinhibition, and Dissocial scales. However, the evidence was more mixed for the PiCD Detachment and Anankastic domains, which may be due to limitations with the content domains for these scales. Consistent with other research and theoretical expectations, a conjoint exploratory factor analysis utilizing the PiCD and MMPI-2-RF PSY-5 scales also indicated that anankastic and disinhibition may be more appropriately conceptualized as measuring opposite poles of one construct. Implications of these findings for the PiCD and the ICD-11 model are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",

Currently, a broad-spectrum, validated PRO measure suitable for all dermatology patients, as part of clinical care, does not exist. Patient-reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMIS) measures track specific domain outcomes across all diseases. To assess the relevance and utility of a computer-adaptive health assessment consisting of three PROMIS domains in routine dermatologic care. This retrospective study evaluated a PROMIS health assessment, consisting of three computer-adaptive test domains (pain interference, anxiety, and depression), administered as part of routine clinical care in three dermatology clinics at an academic medical center. The primary objective was to identify clinically significant associations between high PROMIS domain scores (i.e., t score{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}55) and dermatologic disease, as well as change in PROMIS domain scores in response to treatment. The majority of patients who initiated the assessment completed all domains (88.7{\%}). In patients with atopic dermatitis, acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and psoriasis, high PROMIS scores correlated with clinically relevant outcomes, such as severe disease, unsuccessful treatment, uncontrolled disease, and the presence of a mental health condition. PROMIS Pain Interference, anxiety and depression identified patients with severe disease, unsuccessful treatment regimens, poorly-controlled disease, and/or mental health comorbidities for multiple skin conditions. Further utilization of PROMIS domains in routine clinical care will promote patient-centered care and improve quality of care.",

abstract="Stress is among the most prevalent problems in life; thus, measurement of stress is of great importance for disease prevention and evaluation. This work aims to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) application to measure stress (CAT-S) based on item response theory (IRT). Two types of analyses were performed. The first analysis was to meet the psychometric requirements of the CAT-S. A Paper and Pencil (P{\&}P) test involving 226 items was developed based on eight stress-related scales, and 972 Chinese college students completed the test. The first seven scales were used to build the item bank, and the last scale (i.e., the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) was used to determine the convergent validity of the CAT-S. With some statistical considerations, such as item fit, discrimination, differential item functioning (DIF), and the assumption of unidimensionality, the final item bank comprised 93 items. The second analysis was to simulate the CAT adaptively using the existing item response. A Bayesian method called Expected a Posterior method (EAP) was used to estimate $\theta$. For the item selection strategy, the greatest item information was considered at each step. The stopping rule was determined by the fixed length (10, 11, 12, {\ldots}, 20, and 93) or the prespecified level of measurement precision (standard errors of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8). Finally, the criterion validity was tested by using PSS as a criterion and analyzing the effect of CAT-S diagnosis with a receiver operating curve (ROC). The results showed that (1) the final stress item bank had good quality based on the psychometric evaluation, (2) the CAT-scores were highly correlated with the scores of the final item bank, (3) the scores of the P{\&}P form of PSS were correlated with those of the CAT-S ( > 0.5), (4) the value of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater than 0.7 under each stopping rule, and (5) the CAT-S needed only a small number of items to obtain a highly precise measure of stress. Therefore, the CAT-S presented the theoretically expected advantages, which enabled a rapid, accurate, and efficient dynamic and intelligent measurement of stress.",

Online calibration is a technique to calibrate the parameters of new items in CAT, which seeds new items in the process of answering operational items, and estimates the parameters of new items through the response data of examinees on new items. The most popular estimation methods include one EM cycle method (OEM) and multiple EM cycle method (MEM) under dichotomous item response theory models. This paper extends OEM and MEM to the graded response model (GRM), a popular model for polytomous data with ordered categories. Two simulation studies were carried out to explore online calibration under a variety of conditions, including calibration design, initial item parameter calculation methods, calibration methods, calibration sample size and the number of categories. Results show that the calibration accuracy of new items were acceptable, and which were affected by the interaction of some factors, therefore some conclusions were given.",

Previous studies of low-frequency tone-in-noise detection have shown that when energy cues are made less reliable using a roving-level paradigm, thresholds of listeners with normal hearing (NH) are only slightly increased. This result is consistent with studies demonstrating the importance of temporal envelope cues for masked detection. In contrast, roving-level detection thresholds are more elevated in listeners with SNHL at the test frequency, suggesting stronger weighting of energy cues. The present study extended these tests to a wide range of frequencies and stimulus levels. The authors hypothesized that individual listeners with SNHL use energy and temporal envelope cues differently for masked detection at different frequencies and levels, depending on the degree of hearing loss.",

Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI's psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth.: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI's structure and psychometric properties.: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences.: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.",

Patients completed PROMIS PF-CT, Short Form 36 (SF-36 physical function, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional well-being, role limitations due to physical health, and role limitations due to emotional problems), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS pain, symptoms, activities of daily living [ADLs], sports, and quality of life [QOL]), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC pain, stiffness, and function), EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), and Knee Activity Scale questionnaires at their preoperative visit. Correlations between the PROMs listed above were evaluated along with floor and ceiling effects. Correlations were defined as weak (0.2-0.39), moderate (0.4-0.59), strong (0.6-0.79), and very strong (0.8-1.0). Preoperative data showed that PROMIS PF-CT has a strong correlation with SF-36 PF, KOOS-ADL, WOMAC-function, and EQ-5D; and moderate correlation with KOOS-sport, KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-QOL, WOMAC-pain, and WOMAC-stiffness. The Knee Activity Scale did not show any significant correlation with PROMIS PF-CT ({\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.12, {\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.2080). Of all the PROMs administered, PROMIS PF-CT demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects compared with 11.54{\%} ceiling effect in KOOS-sports, and 5.77{\%} floor effect in KOOS-ADL. On average, patients answered fewer PROMIS PF-CT questions (4.15{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.72). PROMIS PF-CT is a valuable tool to assess preoperative patient-reported physical function in patients that may undergo MRT repair. It correlates strongly with other well-established PROMs. It also demonstrated no floor or ceiling effects and demonstrated a low test burden in our sample of 52 knees.

Three popular item selection indices in CD-CAT were used and their efficiency compared using the new procedure. An additional study was carried out to examine the potential benefit of item review. The results showed that the new procedure is promising in that allowing item review resulted only in a small loss in attribute classification accuracy under some conditions. Moreover, using a blocked-design CD-CAT is beneficial to the extent that it alleviates the negative impact of test anxiety on examinees' true performance.",

However, notwithstanding IOP and other clinical parameters, patient-reported outcomes, including daily functioning, emotional well-being, symptoms, mobility, and social life, remain the foremost concerns for people being treated for glaucoma. These outcomes are measured using objective patient-centered outcome measures (PCOMs) and subjective patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Studies using PCOMs have shown that people with glaucoma have several mobility, navigational and coordination challenges; reading and face recognition deficits; and are slower in adapting to multiple real-world situations when compared to healthy controls. Similarly, studies have consistently demonstrated, using PROMs, that glaucoma substantially and negatively impacts on peoples' self-reported visual functioning, mobility, independence, emotional well-being, self-image, and confidence in healthcare, compared to healthy individuals, particularly in those with late-stage disease undergoing a heavy treatment regimen. The patient-centred effectiveness of current glaucoma treatment paradigms is equivocal due to a lack of well-designed randomized controlled trials; short post-treatment follow-up periods; an inappropriate selection or availability of PROMs; and/or an insensitivity of currently available PROMs to monitor changes especially in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage glaucoma. We provide a comprehensive, albeit non-systematic, critique of the psychometric properties, limitations, and recent advances of currently available glaucoma-specific PCOMs and PROMs. Finally, we propose that item banking and computerized adaptive testing methods can address the multiple limitations of paper-pencil PROMs; customize their administration; and have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for people with glaucoma.",

The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the preoperative expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery and (2) determine the relationship between preoperative patient demographics, PROs, and preoperative patient expectations. We hypothesized that younger patients with worse function and worse general health status would have greater expectations of knee surgery. We analyzed data from 399 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic medical center. We utilized the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System to measure preoperative expectations. Multiple legacy PRO measures were recorded, as well as the new Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) Computer Adaptive Testing. Nonparametric statistical analyses were performed to determine significance. Overall, patients undergoing knee surgery had high expectations, with a mean of 88.0 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 86.7-89.3) and median of 91.7 (95{\%} CI, 89.2-94.3). Greater preoperative expectations of knee surgery were associated with higher income, surgically na{\"{\i}}ve knee, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, better PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores, greater Marx knee activity scores, and lower total body pain ({\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). Preoperative expectations of patients undergoing knee surgery are associated with a history of prior knee surgery, income, general and mental health, activity, and pain. Expectations were also found to be associated with PRO measures of function and psychological well-being. These findings may have implications for patient education and shared decision-making preoperatively. The level of evidence for the study is IV.",

This study outlines the first two phases of the multi-stage process: content development and item evaluation.: We grouped retinal and vitreoretinal diseases into hereditary and acquired. Development of the item banks involved two phases: item identification and item evaluation. The items were extracted from three sources: (1) 17 pre-existing PRO instruments, (2) 4 qualitative studies and (3) 79 semi-structured interviews. Item evaluation involved three stages namely, binning (grouping) and winnowing (reduction), expert panel opinion and cognitive interviews.: The item identification phase yielded 1,217 items. After three sessions of binning and winnowing, items were reduced to a minimally representative set ( = 411) across nine QoL domains namely, activity limitation, emotional, social, health concerns, symptoms, economic, mobility, convenience, and coping. The hereditary group had a total of 345 items and the acquired group had a total of 257 items. After 23 cognitive interviews items were amended for hereditary diseases resulting in a final set of 345 items and 3 items were amended for acquired diseases, resulting in a final set of 254 items. Overall across nine domains 189 items were common to hereditary and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.: As most of the items were unique to hereditary versus acquired retinal and vitreoretinal disease groups separate item banks are required to capture the QoL impacts for hereditary and acquired retinal and vitreoretinal diseases.",

abstract="The rise of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement across medicine has been swift and now extends to the world of orthopedic trauma. However, PRO measures (PROMs) applied to trauma patients pose special considerations; measuring ``episodes of care'' is less straightforward, injuries are heterogeneous in their severity, and the patient's initial visit is ``postinjury.'' Obtaining baseline scores and assessing the impact of a traumatic event on mental health are key considerations. Currently, few, if any, trauma registries include PROs; though general and condition-specific PROMs plus the patient empowerment measure of Patient Activation represent meaningful inputs for the clinical decision-making process. To be useful in trauma care, PROMs should be psychometrically sound and validated, be used for capturing function, screen for mental state and substance use, and give the clinician a sense of the patient's ``activation'' (engagement in their own health). Although the implementation of routine PRO collection can seem daunting, clinicians can use a multitude of electronic resources to access validated measures and simplify the implementation process. Computer-adaptive testing has evolved to help minimize patient burden, and PROM collection must maximize efficiency. Once established as part of your practice, PROs become an important tool to track recovery, identify mental health issues, engage in the prevention of future injury, and enable care of the whole patient.",

Several item selection methods that proved to be more advantageous than the maximum Fisher information method are not practical for bifactor MCAT due to time-consuming computations resulting from high dimensionality. To make them applicable in bifactor MCAT, dimension reduction is applied to four item selection methods, which are the posterior-weighted Fisher D-optimality (PDO) and three non-Fisher information-based methods-posterior expected Kullback-Leibler information (PKL), continuous entropy (CE), and mutual information (MI). They were compared with the Bayesian D-optimality (BDO) method in terms of estimation precision. When both the general and group factors are the measurement objectives, BDO, PDO, CE, and MI perform equally well and better than PKL. When the group factors represent nuisance dimensions, MI and CE perform the best in estimating the general factor, followed by the BDO, PDO, and PKL. How the bifactor pattern and test length affect estimation accuracy was also discussed.",

There are many dozens of PROs available to foot and ankle surgeons with little consensus on which measures are most appropriate for a given condition. These measures vary widely in length, validity, and content. When integrating PROs into clinical practice, we recommend that clinicians should collect, at a minimum, validated PRO scores that assess pain, function, and general health. Furthermore, concise instruments should be used wherever possible to minimize patient burden, maximize patient engagement, and ensure meaningful data are collected. In the near future, outcomes registries employing computer adaptive testing will facilitate the routine collection of PRO data from all patients.",

abstract="Genetic variants associated with disease outcomes can be used to develop personalized treatment. To reach this precision medicine goal, hundreds of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in the past decade to search for promising genetic variants associated with various traits. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However, in total these identified variants explain only part of the variation for most complex traits. There remain many genetic variants with small effect sizes to be discovered, which calls for the development of (a) GWAS with more samples and more comprehensively genotyped variants, for example, the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is planning to conduct whole genome sequencing on over 100{\thinspace}000 individuals; and (b) novel and more powerful statistical analysis methods. The current dominating GWAS analysis approach is the ``single trait'' association test, despite the fact that many GWAS are conducted in deeply phenotyped cohorts including many correlated and well-characterized outcomes, which can help improve the power to detect novel variants if properly analyzed, as suggested by increasing evidence that pleiotropy, where a genetic variant affects multiple traits, is the norm in genome-phenome associations. We aim to develop pleiotropy informed powerful association test methods across multiple traits for GWAS. Since it is generally very hard to access individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data for those existing GWAS, due to privacy concerns and various logistical considerations, we develop rigorous statistical methods for pleiotropy informed adaptive multitrait association test methods that need only summary association statistics publicly available from most GWAS. We first develop a pleiotropy test, which has powerful performance for truly pleiotropic variants but is sensitive to the pleiotropy assumption. We then develop a pleiotropy informed adaptive test that has robust and powerful performance under various genetic models. We develop accurate and efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-value for the proposed adaptive test without the need of resampling or permutation. We illustrate the performance of proposed methods through application to joint association test of GWAS meta-analysis summary data for several glycemic traits. Our proposed adaptive test identified several novel loci missed by individual trait based GWAS meta-analysis. All the proposed methods are implemented in a publicly available R package.",

abstract="Genome-wide sequencing enables evaluation of associations between traits and combinations of variants in genes and pathways. But such evaluation requires multi-locus association tests with good power, regardless of the variant and trait characteristics. And since analyzing families may yield more power than analyzing unrelated individuals, we need multi-locus tests applicable to both related and unrelated individuals. Here we describe such tests, and we introduce SKAT-X, a new test statistic that uses genome-wide data obtained from related or unrelated subjects to optimize power for the specific data at hand. Simulations show that: a) SKAT-X performs well regardless of variant and trait characteristics; and b) for binary traits, analyzing affected relatives brings more power than analyzing unrelated individuals, consistent with previous findings for single-locus tests. We illustrate the methods by application to rare unclassified missense variants in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA2, as applied to combined data from prostate cancer families and unrelated prostate cancer cases and controls in the Multi-ethnic Cohort (MEC).

abstract="An important aspect of the perceived quality of vocal music is the degree to which the vocalist sings in tune. Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test's reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.",

Among an online sample of Australian adults, there were relatively minor differences in the performance of the adaptive tests and static short forms when compared with the full scales. Moreover, both adaptive and static short forms generated similar effect sizes across treatment in a clinical sample. This provides further evidence for the use of static or adaptive short forms of the SIAS/SPS rather than the lengthier 20-item versions. However, at the individual level, the adaptive tests were able to maintain an acceptable level of precision, using few items as possible, across the severity continua in contrast to the static short forms.",

abstract="There are many item selection methods proposed for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) applications. However, not all of them have been used in computerized multistage testing (ca-MST). This study uses some item selection methods as a routing method in ca-MST framework. These are maximum Fisher information (MFI), maximum likelihood weighted information (MLWI), maximum posterior weighted information (MPWI), Kullback-Leibler (KL), and posterior Kullback-Leibler (KLP). The main purpose of this study is to examine the performance of these methods when they are used as a routing method in ca-MST applications. These five information methods under four ca-MST panel designs and two test lengths (30 items and 60 items) were tested using the parameters of a real item bank. Results were evaluated with overall findings (mean bias, root mean square error, correlation between true and estimated thetas, and module exposure rates) and conditional findings (conditional absolute bias, standard error of measurement, and root mean square error). It was found that test length affected the outcomes much more than other study conditions. Under 30-item conditions, 1-3 designs outperformed other panel designs. Under 60-item conditions, 1-3-3 designs were better than other panel designs. Each routing method performed well under particular conditions; there was no clear best method in the studied conditions. The recommendations for routing methods in any particular condition were provided for researchers and practitioners as well as the limitations of these results.",

abstract="This study explored calibrating a large item bank for use in multidimensional health measurement with computerized adaptive testing, using both item responses and response time (RT) information. The Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care is a patient-reported outcomes measure comprised of three correlated scales (Applied Cognition, Daily Activities, and Mobility). All items from each scale are Likert type, so that a respondent chooses a response from an ordered set of four response options. The most appropriate item response theory model for analyzing and scoring these items is the multidimensional graded response model (MGRM). During the field testing of the items, an interviewer read each item to a patient and recorded, on a tablet computer, the patient's responses and the software recorded RTs. Due to the large item bank with over 300 items, data collection was conducted in four batches with a common set of anchor items to link the scale. van der Linden's (2007) hierarchical modeling framework was adopted. Several models, with or without interviewer as a covariate and with or without interaction between interviewer and items, were compared for each batch of data. It was found that the model with the interaction between interviewer and item, when the interaction effect was constrained to be proportional, fit the data best. Therefore, the final hierarchical model with a lognormal model for RT and the MGRM for response data was fitted to all batches of data via a concurrent calibration. Evaluation of parameter estimates revealed that (1) adding response time information did not affect the item parameter estimates and their standard errors significantly; (2) adding response time information helped reduce the standard error of patients' multidimensional latent trait estimates, but adding interviewer as a covariate did not result in further improvement. Implications of the findings for follow up adaptive test delivery design are discussed.",

METHODS: A total of 512 adult spine surgery patients at a single institution completed the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7), 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression scale, and PROMIS Anxiety and Depression computer-adaptive tests (CATs) preoperatively. Correlation coefficients were calculated between PROMIS scores and GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores. Published reference tables were used to determine the presence of anxiety or depression using GAD-7 and PHQ-8. Sensitivity and specificity of published guidance on the PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were compared. Guidance from 3 sources was compared: published GAD-7 and PHQ-8 crosswalk tables, American Psychiatric Association scales, and expert clinical consensus. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine data-driven cut-points for PROMIS Anxiety and Depression. Significance was accepted as p < 0.05. RESULTS: In 512 spine surgery patients, anxiety and depression were prevalent preoperatively (55{\%} with any anxiety, 24{\%} with generalized anxiety screen-positive; and 54{\%} with any depression, 24{\%} with probable major depression). Correlations were moderately strong between PROMIS Anxiety and GAD-7 scores (r = 0.72; p < 0.001) and between PROMIS Depression and PHQ-8 scores (r = 0.74; p < 0.001). The observed correlation of the PROMIS Depression score was greater with the PHQ-8 cognitive/affective score (r = 0.766) than with the somatic score (r = 0.601) (p < 0.001). PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs were able to detect the presence of generalized anxiety screen-positive (sensitivity, 86.0{\%}; specificity, 81.6{\%}) and of probable major depression (sensitivity, 82.3{\%}; specificity, 81.4{\%}). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated data-driven cut-points for these groups. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS Anxiety and Depression CATs are reliable tools for identifying generalized anxiety screen-positive spine surgery patients and those with probable major depression.",

abstract="Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data.",

PROs comprise a wide range of outcomes including basic clinical symptom scores and complex metrics such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There is limited data on how postoperative complications following cancer surgery affect symptoms and HRQoL. For this reason the primary aim of the PATRONUS study is to investigate how perioperative complications affect cancer-related symptoms and HRQoL in patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery.

abstract="Many GWAS conducted in the past decade have identified tens of thousands of disease related variants, which in total explained only part of the heritability for most traits. There remain many more genetics variants with small effect sizes to be discovered. This has motivated the development of sequencing studies with larger sample sizes and increased resolution of genotyped variants, e.g., the ongoing NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) whole genome sequencing project. An alternative approach is the development of novel and more powerful statistical methods. The current dominating approach in the field of GWAS analysis is the ``single trait single variant'' association test, despite the fact that most GWAS are conducted in deeply-phenotyped cohorts with many correlated traits measured. In this paper, we aim to develop rigorous methods that integrate multiple correlated traits and multiple variants to improve the power to detect novel variants. In recognition of the difficulty of accessing raw genotype and phenotype data due to privacy and logistic concerns, we develop methods that are applicable to publicly available GWAS summary data.",

The objectives of the study were to determine the demographic, diagnostic, and psychologic factors associated with opioid use; and to determine the clinical correlates of opioid use. We hypothesized that preoperative opioid use would be associated with worse patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. The sample consisted of 383 patients undergoing knee surgery. The patients were classified as either opioid or nonopioid users on the basis of medical record review. All participants completed a battery of clinical assessments, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive testing in six domains: Physical Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Social Satisfaction, Anxiety, and Depression. Analyses were conducted to examine clinical variables as a function of opioid use. The results indicated that opioid use was associated with female gender, unemployment, smoking, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, greater number of previous surgeries, depression or anxiety, and worse expectation of surgery ({\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). Multivariable analysis found opioid use to be a significant independent predictor of multiple PRO measures in patients undergoing knee surgery. Potential explanations for these findings are presented, and clinical implications are discussed.",

journal="Applied psychological measurement",
year="2017",
month="Oct",
day="15",
volume="41",
number="7",
pages="495--511",
abstract="Computer adaptive tests provide important measurement advantages over traditional fixed-item tests, but research on the psychological reactions of test takers to adaptive tests is lacking. In particular, it has been suggested that test-taker engagement, and possibly test performance as a consequence, could benefit from the control that adaptive tests have on the number of test items examinees answer correctly. However, previous research on this issue found little support for this possibility. This study expands on previous research by examining this issue in the context of a mathematical ability assessment and by considering the possible effect of immediate feedback of response correctness on test engagement, test anxiety, time on task, and test performance. Middle school students completed a mathematics assessment under one of three test type conditions (fixed, adaptive, or easier adaptive) and either with or without immediate feedback about the correctness of responses. Results showed little evidence for test type effects. The easier adaptive test resulted in higher engagement and lower anxiety than either the adaptive or fixed-item tests; however, no significant differences in performance were found across test types, although performance was significantly higher across all test types when students received immediate feedback. In addition, these effects were not related to ability level, as measured by the state assessment achievement levels. The possibility that test experiences in adaptive tests may not in practice be significantly different than in fixed-item tests is raised and discussed to explain the results of this and previous studies.",

This study addressed the primary null hypothesis that the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function score 1 month (range, 3-8 weeks) after hand surgery is not associated with PROMIS Depression and PROMIS Pain Interference scores prior to surgery, accounting for other factors. Using an institution-wide database of routinely collected patient-reported outcomes, we identified adult patients who underwent wrist ganglion excision, trapeziometacarpal arthroplasty, hand ganglion excision, trigger digit, De Quervain, and carpal tunnel release. Measures collected included the PROMIS Physical Function Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT), PROMIS Pain Interference CAT, and PROMIS Depression CAT. We sought factors associated with postsurgical PROMIS Physical Function scores and change between preoperative and postoperative score using multivariable linear regression, accounting for age, sex, surgery type, provider, and time from surgery to postsurgical measurement.  Higher postoperative PROMIS Physical Function score was independently associated with lower PROMIS Pain Interference scores, lower PROMIS Depression scores, younger age, and treatment by provider team 3. Greater change in PROMIS Physical Function score was independently associated with greater PROMIS Pain Interference scores, greater time from surgery, and treatment by provider team 3.  Mood and effective coping strategies affect the level of symptoms and limitations during recovery from hand surgery and represent important treatment opportunities for enhancing recovery.",

abstract="We examined cultural differences in the item characteristic functions of self-reported of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mania-hypomania in a Latino population taking Computerized Adaptive Tests for Mental Health (CAT-MH) in Spanish versus a non-Latino sample taking the tests in English. We studied differential item functioning (DIF) of the most common adaptively administered symptom items out of a bank of 1,008 items between Latino (n = 1276) and non-Latino (n = 798) subjects. For depression, we identified 4 items with DIF that were good discriminators for non-Latinos but poor discriminators for Latinos. These items were related to cheerfulness, life satisfaction, concentration, and fatigue. The correlation between the original calibration and a Latino-only new calibration after eliminating these items was r = .990. For anxiety, no items with DIF were identified. The correlation between the original and new calibrations was r = .993. For mania-hypomania, we identified 4 items with differential item functioning that were good discriminators for non-Latinos but poor discriminators for Latinos. These items were related to risk-taking, self-assurance, and sexual activity. The correlation between the original and new calibration was r = .962. Once the identified items were removed, the correlation between the original calibration and a Latino-only calibration was r = .96 or greater. These findings reveal that the CAT-MH can be reliably used to measure depression, anxiety, and mania in Latinos taking these tests in Spanish.

Although we agree that many of the extant studies are flawed, this meta-analysis showed clear efficacy of fluoxetine in the NMA, and for sertraline and escitalopram in pairwise analyses. Consequently, these papers underestimate the benefits of antidepressants for paediatric depression, and provide support for current practice guideline, which recommends the use of an antidepressant if the patient does not respond to psychotherapy. In these circumstances, fluoxetine should be the first choice, with escitalopram and sertraline as alternatives.

Our aims were to examine construct validity of the shoulder computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and the foot-and-ankle CAT, as a measure of FS for patients selecting the shoulder or the foot-and-ankle as their main body part affected by their lymphedema. We assessed the ability of the FS scores to distinguish between patient groups in clinically expected ways at admission and discharge from physical therapy. At admission (n=1600), patients who were younger and had more acute symptoms, less severe lymphedema, less co-morbidities, no relevant surgical history, did not use medications for chronic conditions, and exercised regularly, had higher FS. At discharge (n=611), patients who were younger and had less advanced lymphedema, fewer co-morbidities, no relevant surgical history, did not use medications for chronic conditions, exercised regularly, and had more acute symptoms had higher FS change, after controlling for their baseline FS score. Low participation rates in FS outcomes data collection could have biased results. Overall, the CAT-based FS PROMs used in this study discriminated between patient groups in clinically logical ways both at intake and at discharge from lymphedema treatment.",

Following this recommendation, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) prioritized the development of measures of cognitive functioning for individuals with disabilities, noting that measures of cognitive functioning ``have not been developed for systemic application in the field of medical rehabilitation. Cognition is both a rehabilitation outcome and a factor related to broader functional and community outcomes for individuals with a wide variety of disabling conditions'' (Office of Special Education {\&} Rehabilitation Services, 2009, p. 37193). From this came the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function project (NIH Toolbox) which provides a comprehensive set of cognitive, motor, sensory, and emotional health and function measures for use in clinical, longitudinal, and epidemiological research. The nine papers comprising this special section of Rehabilitation Psychology reflect the sustained collaborative efforts of more than two dozen investigators working at six sites over the past 8 years. They are an initial attempt to validate the NIHTB-CB in disability samples, and they provide initial evidence that the NIHTB-CB can be used with individuals who have TBI, SCI, or stroke. The articles published here reflect the fulfillment of recommendations made during a state-of-the-science conference in 2007. (PsycINFO Database Record",

At issue is the merits of intervention modalities, such as computer-based cognitive training, physical exercise training, and non-invasive brain stimulation, and whether such interventions synergistically enhance cognition. To investigate this issue, we conducted a comprehensive 4-month randomized controlled trial in which 318 healthy, young adults were enrolled in one of five interventions: (1) Computer-based cognitive training on six adaptive tests of executive function; (2) Cognitive and physical exercise training; (3) Cognitive training combined with non-invasive brain stimulation and physical exercise training; (4) Active control training in adaptive visual search and change detection tasks; and (5) Passive control. Our findings demonstrate that multimodal training significantly enhanced learning (relative to computer-based cognitive training alone) and provided an effective method to promote skill learning across multiple cognitive domains, spanning executive functions, working memory, and planning and problem solving. These results help to establish the beneficial effects of multimodal intervention and identify key areas for future research in the continued effort to improve human cognition.",

abstract="Working memory tasks designed for children usually present trials in order of ascending difficulty, with testing discontinued when the child fails a particular level. Unfortunately, this procedure comes with a number of issues, such as decreased engagement from high-ability children, vulnerability of the scores to temporary mind-wandering, and large between-subjects variations in number of trials, testing time, and proactive interference. To circumvent these problems, the goal of the present study was to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing working memory using an adaptive testing procedure. The principle of adaptive testing is to dynamically adjust the level of difficulty as the task progresses to match the participant's ability. We used this method to develop an adaptive complex span task (the ACCES) comprising verbal and visuo-spatial subtests. The task presents a fixed number of trials to all participants, allows for partial credit scoring, and can be used with children regardless of ability level. The ACCES demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in a sample of 268 children aged 8-13 years, confirming the feasibility of using adaptive tasks to measure working memory capacity in children. A free-to-use implementation of the ACCES is provided.",

abstract="Computer adaptive testing (CAT) is a kind of tailored testing, in that it is a form of computer-based testing that is adaptive to each test-taker's ability level. In this review, the impacts of CAT are discussed from different perspectives in order to illustrate crucial points to keep in mind during the development and implementation of CAT. Test developers and psychometricians often emphasize the efficiency and accuracy of CAT in comparison to traditional linear tests. However, many test-takers report feeling discouraged after taking CATs, and this feeling can reduce learning self-efficacy and motivation. A trade-off must be made between the psychological experiences of test-takers and measurement efficiency. From the perspective of educators and subject matter experts, nonstatistical specifications, such as content coverage, content balance, and form length are major concerns. Thus, accreditation bodies may be faced with a discrepancy between the perspectives of psychometricians and those of subject matter experts. In order to improve test-takers' impressions of CAT, the author proposes increasing the target probability of answering correctly in the item selection algorithm even if doing so consequently decreases measurement efficiency. Two different methods, CAT with a shadow test approach and computerized multistage testing, have been developed in order to ensure the satisfaction of subject matter experts. In the shadow test approach, a full-length test is assembled that meets the constraints and provides maximum information at the current ability estimate, while computerized multistage testing gives subject matter experts an opportunity to review all test forms prior to administration.",

abstract="Purpose To improve the mental health component of the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), developed for the US Social Security Administration's (SSA) disability determination process. Specifically our goal was to expand the WD-FAB scales of mood {\&} emotions, resilience, social interactions, and behavioral control to improve the depth and breadth of the current scales and expand the content coverage to include aspects of cognition {\&} communication function. Methods Data were collected from a random, stratified sample of 1695 claimants applying for the SSA work disability benefits, and a general population sample of 2025 working age adults. 169 new items were developed to replenish the WD-FAB scales and analyzed using factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis to construct unidimensional scales. We conducted computer adaptive test (CAT) simulations to examine the psychometric properties of the WD-FAB. Results Analyses supported the inclusion of four mental health subdomains: Cognition {\&} Communication (68 items), Self-Regulation (34 items), Resilience {\&} Sociability (29 items) and Mood {\&} Emotions (34 items). All scales yielded acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions IRT methods were effective in expanding the WD-FAB to assess mental health function. The WD-FAB has the potential to enhance work disability assessment both within the context of the SSA disability programs as well as other clinical and vocational rehabilitation settings.",

abstract="Highly efficient assessments that better account for comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders (internalizing) are required to identify individuals who are most at risk of psychopathology in the community. The current study examined the efficiency and validity associated with a multidimensional computerized adaptive test (CAT) to measure broad and specific levels of internalizing psychopathology. The sample comprised 3,175 respondents to an online survey. Items from five banks (generalized anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder) were jointly calibrated using a bifactor item response theory model. Simulations indicated that an adaptive algorithm could accurately (s ≥ 0.90) estimate general internalizing and specific disorder scores using on average 44 items in comparison with the full 133-item bank (67{\%} reduction in items). Scores on the CAT demonstrate convergent and divergent validity with previously validated short severity scales and could significantly differentiate cases of  disorder. As such, the CAT validly measures both broad and specific constructs of internalizing disorders in a manner similar to the full item bank and a static brief form but with greater gains in efficiency and, therefore, a reduced degree of respondent burden.",

abstract="Proposed for the 11th edition of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) is a dimensional trait model for the classification of personality disorder (Tyrer, Reed, {\&} Crawford, 2015). The ICD-11 proposal consists of 5 broad domains: negative affective, detachment, dissocial, disinhibition, and anankastic (Mulder, Horwood, Tyrer, Carter, {\&} Joyce, 2016). Several field trials have examined this proposal, yet none has included a direct measure of the trait model. The purpose of the current study was to develop and provide initial validation for the Personality Inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD), a self-report measure of this proposed 5-domain maladaptive trait model. Item selection and scale construction proceeded through 3 initial data collections assessing potential item performance. Two subsequent studies were conducted for scale validation. In Study 1, the PiCD was evaluated in a sample of 259 MTurk participants (who were or had been receiving mental health treatment) with respect to 2 measures of general personality structure: The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised and the 5-Dimensional Personality Test. In Study 2, the PiCD was evaluated in an additional sample of 285 participants with respect to 2 measures of maladaptive personality traits: The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 and the Computerized Adaptive Test for Personality Disorders. Study 3 provides an item-level exploratory structural equation model with the combined samples from Studies 1 and 2. The results are discussed with respect to the validity of the measure and the potential benefits for future research in having a direct, self-report measure of the ICD-11 trait proposal.

abstract="Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has received increasing attention over the past few years in educational measurement. Like all other formats of CAT, item replenishment is an essential part of MCAT for its item bank maintenance and management, which governs retiring overexposed or obsolete items over time and replacing them with new ones. Moreover, calibration precision of the new items will directly affect the estimation accuracy of examinees' ability vectors. In unidimensional CAT (UCAT) and cognitive diagnostic CAT, online calibration techniques have been developed to effectively calibrate new items. However, there has been very little discussion of online calibration in MCAT in the literature. Thus, this paper proposes new online calibration methods for MCAT based upon some popular methods used in UCAT. Three representative methods, Method A, the 'one EM cycle' method and the 'multiple EM cycles' method, are generalized to MCAT. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare the three new methods by manipulating three factors (test length, item bank design, and level of correlation between coordinate dimensions). The results showed that all the new methods were able to recover the item parameters accurately, and the adaptive online calibration designs showed some improvements compared to the random design under most conditions.",

Criterion measures rationally selected to represent similar (depression, anhedonia, anxiety) and dissimilar (behavioral, thought, and somatic dysfunction) psychological constructs were administered to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the depression module.

abstract="Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1{\%}, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year.",

The use of PROMIS can facilitate comparisons among clinical subpopulations and with the U.S. general population.

Eighty-six adult patients (mean age{\thinspace}={\thinspace}44; 55{\%} female; 87{\%} white; 50{\%} NF1, 41{\%} NF2 and 9{\%} schwannomatosis) completed a battery of PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CATs).

However, scores were distributed across a broad range for each PROMIS measure ({\textpm}3 SDs). Clinically meaningful scores (defined >1 SD impairment) were observed in 20{\%} (pain interference), 17{\%} (pain behavior), 16{\%} (physical function), 16{\%} (anxiety), 16{\%} (depression), 15{\%} (satisfaction with social roles), 13{\%} (fatigue), 6{\%} (anger), and 5{\%} (satisfaction with discretionary social activities) of the sample. All PROMIS measures were highly interrelated in bivariate analysis (P{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}.001). There were no differences in PROMIS scores by disease type (NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis), or self reported learning disabilities, or compared with the US population. Scores suggest a broad continuum of symptoms and functioning in patients with NF that is not affected by NF type, as well as interrelation among the physical and psychosocial domains as measured by PROMIS. PROMIS measures may be useful in clinical practice to monitor changes in symptoms and functioning over time, as well as in clinical trials to determine patient reported changes during drug and psychosocial clinical trials.",

abstract="Due to its high dimensionality and high noise levels, analysis of a large brain functional network may not be powerful and easy to interpret; instead, decomposition of a large network into smaller subcomponents called modules may be more promising as suggested by some empirical evidence. For example, alteration of brain modularity is observed in patients suffering from various types of brain malfunctions. Although several methods exist for estimating brain functional networks, such as the sample correlation matrix or graphical lasso for a sparse precision matrix, it is still difficult to extract modules from such network estimates. Motivated by these considerations, we adapt a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) framework to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data to identify modular structures in brain functional networks. Modular structures are identified by using topological overlap matrix (TOM) elements in hierarchical clustering. We propose applying a new adaptive test built on the proportional odds model (POM) that can be applied to a high-dimensional setting, where the number of variables (p) can exceed the sample size (n) in addition to the usual p < n setting. We applied our proposed methods to the ADNI data to test for associations between a genetic variant and either the whole brain functional network or its various subcomponents using various connectivity measures. We uncovered several modules based on the control cohort, and some of them were marginally associated with the APOE4 variant and several other SNPs; however, due to the small sample size of the ADNI data, larger studies are needed.",

abstract="The development of the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory (ESI) was motivated by the need to comprehensively assess the interrelated nature of externalizing psychopathology and personality using an empirically driven framework. The ESI measures 23 theoretically distinct yet related unidimensional facets of externalizing, which are structured under 3 superordinate factors representing general externalizing, callous aggression, and substance abuse. One limitation of the ESI is its length at 415 items. To facilitate the use of the ESI in busy clinical and research settings, the current study sought to examine the efficiency and accuracy of a computerized adaptive version of the ESI. Data were collected over 3 waves and totaled 1,787 participants recruited from undergraduate psychology courses as well as male and female state prisons. A series of 6 algorithms with different termination rules were simulated to determine the efficiency and accuracy of each test under 3 different assumed distributions. Scores generated using an optimal adaptive algorithm evidenced high correlations (r > .9) with scores generated using the full ESI, brief ESI item-based factor scales, and the 23 facet scales. The adaptive algorithms for each facet administered a combined average of 115 items, a 72{\%} decrease in comparison to the full ESI. Similarly, scores on the item-based factor scales of the ESI-brief form (57 items) were generated using on average of 17 items, a 70{\%} decrease. The current study successfully demonstrates that an adaptive algorithm can generate similar scores for the ESI and the 3 item-based factor scales using a fraction of the total item pool.

Participants were college students (n = 98) recruited through the university subject pool. A series of a priori hypotheses were developed for each of the 6 interpersonal functioning scales of the MMPI-2-RF, expressed as predicted correlations with construct-relevant CAT-PD-SF scales. Of the 27 specific predictions, 21 were supported by substantial (≥ |.30|) correlations. The MMPI-2-RF Family Problems scale (FML) demonstrated the strongest correlations with CAT-PD-SF scales Anhedonia and Mistrust; Cynicism (RC3) was most highly correlated with Mistrust and Norm Violation; Interpersonal Passivity (IPP) was most highly correlated with Domineering and Rudeness; Social Avoidance (SAV) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anhedonia; Shyness (SHY) was most highly correlated with Social Withdrawal and Anxioiusness; and Disaffiliativeness (DSF) was most highly correlated with Emotional Detachment and Mistrust. Results are largely consistent with hypotheses suggesting support for both models of constructs relevant to interpersonal functioning. Future research designed to more precisely differentiate Social Avoidance (SAV) and Shyness (SHY) is suggested.",

abstract="Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for positive and negative psychotic experiences were developed and tested in N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}5705 help-seeking, non-psychotic young individuals. Instead of presenting all items, CATs choose a varying number of different items during test administration depending on respondents' previous answers, reducing the average number of items while still obtaining accurate person estimates. We assessed the appropriateness of two-parameter logistic models to positive and negative symptoms of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ), computed measurement precision of all items and resulting adaptive tests along psychotic dimensions by Real Data Simulations (RDS), and computed indices for criterion and predictive validities of the CATs. For all items, mean absolute differences between observed and expected response probabilities were smaller than 0.02. CAT-POS predicted transition to psychosis and duration of hospitalization in individuals at-risk for psychosis, and CAT-NEG was suggestively related to later functioning. Regarding psychosis risk classifications of help-seeking individuals, CAT-POS performed less than the PQ-16. Adaptive testing based on self-reported positive and negative symptoms in individuals at-risk for psychosis is a feasible method to select patients for further risk classification. These promising findings need to be replicated prospectively in a non-selective sample that also includes non-at-risk individuals. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.",

The CAT-Mental Health (CAT-MH) was administered to 1614 adult psychiatric outpatients and 419 perinatal women with IRB approval. We examined individual item-level differences using logistic regression and overall score differences by scoring the perinatal data using the original bifactor model calibration based on the psychiatric sample data and a new bifactor model calibration based on the perinatal data and computing their correlation. To examine convergent validity, we computed correlations of the CAT-MH with contemporaneously administered Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS). The rate of major depression in the perinatal sample was 13 {\%}. Rates of anxiety, mania, and suicide risk were 5, 6, and 0.4 {\%}, respectively. One of 66 depression items, one of 69 anxiety items, and 15 of 53 mania items exhibited DIF (i.e., failure to discriminate between high and low levels of the disorder) in the perinatal sample based on the psychiatric sample calibration. Removal of these items resulted in correlations of the original and perinatal calibrations of r{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.983 for depression, r{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.986 for anxiety, and r{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.932 for mania. The 91.3 {\%} of cases were concordantly categorized as either ``at-risk'' or ``low-risk'' between the EPDS and the perinatal calibration of the CAT-MH. There was little evidence of DIF for depression and anxiety symptoms in perinatal women. This was not true for mania. Now calibrated for perinatal women, the CAT-MH can be evaluated for longitudinal symptom monitoring.",

A CAT simulation was performed on each of the 3 MASQ subscales (Positive Affect, Negative Affect, and Somatic Anxiety). With the CAT simulation's stopping rule set at a high level of measurement precision, the results showed that patients' test administration can be shortened substantially; the mean decrease in items used for the subscales ranged from 56{\%} up to 74{\%}. Furthermore, the predictive utility of the CAT simulations was sufficient for all MASQ scales. The findings reveal that developing a MASQ CAT for clinical subjects is useful as it leads to more efficient measurement without compromising the reliability of the test outcomes.

The statistical methodology is unique in that it is based on multidimensional item response theory (severity) and random forests (diagnosis) instead of traditional mental health measurement based on classical test theory (a simple total score) or unidimensional item response theory. We show that the information contained in large item banks consisting of hundreds of symptom items can be efficiently calibrated using multidimensional item response theory, and the information contained in these large item banks can be precisely extracted using adaptive administration of a small set of items for each individual. In terms of diagnosis, computerized adaptive diagnostic screening can accurately track an hour-long face-to-face clinician diagnostic interview for major depressive disorder (as an example) in less than a minute using an average of four questions with unprecedented high sensitivity and specificity. Directions for future research and applications are discussed.",

However, a key assumption of M-Method A is that it treats person parameter estimates as their true values, thus this method might yield erroneous item calibration when person parameter estimates contain non-ignorable measurement errors. To improve the performance of M-Method A, this paper proposes a new MCAT online calibration method, namely, the full functional MLE-M-Method A (FFMLE-M-Method A). This new method combines the full functional MLE (Jones {\&} Jin in Psychometrika 59:59-75, 1994; Stefanski {\&} Carroll in Annals of Statistics 13:1335-1351, 1985) with the original M-Method A in an effort to correct for the estimation error of ability vector that might otherwise adversely affect the precision of item calibration. Two correction schemes are also proposed when implementing the new method. A simulation study was conducted to show that the new method generated more accurate item parameter estimation than the original M-Method A in almost all conditions.",

abstract="Decline in cognitive ability is a core diagnostic criterion for dementia. Knowing the extent of decline requires a baseline score from which change can be reckoned. In the absence of prior cognitive ability scores, vocabulary-based cognitive tests are used to estimate premorbid cognitive ability. It is important that such tests are short yet informative, to maximize information and practicability. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) is commonly used to estimate premorbid intelligence. People are asked to pronounce 50 words ranging from easy to difficult but whether its words conform to a hierarchy is unknown. Five hundred eighty-seven healthy community-dwelling older people with known age 11 IQ scores completed the NART as part of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study. Mokken analysis was used to explore item responses for unidimensional, ordinal, and hierarchical scales. A strong hierarchical scale (``mini-NART'') of 23 of the 50 items was identified. These items are invariantly ordered across all ability levels. The validity of the interpretation of this briefer scale's score as an estimate of premorbid ability was examined using the actual age 11 IQ score. The mini-NART accounted for a similar amount of the variance in age 11 IQ as the full NART (NART = 46.5{\%}, mini-NART = 44.8{\%}). The mini-NART is proposed as a useful short clinical tool to estimate prior cognitive ability. The mini-NART has clinical relevance, comprising highly discriminatory, invariantly ordered items allowing for sensitive measurement, and adaptive testing, reducing test administration time, and patient stress.",

abstract="The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was devised to facilitate assessment of patient self-reported health status, taking advantage of Item Response Theory. We aimed to assess measurement properties of the PROMIS Depression item bank and an 8-item static short form in a Spanish clinical sample. A three-month follow-up study of patients with active mood/anxiety symptoms (n = 218) was carried out. We assessed model unidimensionality (Confirmatory Item Factor Analysis), reliability (internal consistency and Item Information Curves), and validity (convergent-discriminant with correlations; known-groups with comparison of means and effect sizes; and criterion validity with Receiver operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis). We also assessed 3-month responsiveness to change (Cohen's effect sizes (d) in stable and recovered patients). The unidimensional model showed adequate fit (CFI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.08). Information Curves had reliabilities over 0.90 throughout most of the score continuum. As expected, we observed high correlations with external self-reported depression, and moderate with self-reported anxiety and clinical measures. The item bank showed an increasing severity gradient from no disorder (mean = 48, SE = 0.6) to depression with comorbid anxiety (mean = 55.8, SE = 0.4). PROMIS detected depression disorder with great accuracy according to the area under the curve (AUC = 0.89). Both formats, item bank and short form, were highly responsive to change in recovered patients (d > 0.7) and had small changes in stable patients (d < 0.2). The good metric properties of the Spanish PROMIS Depression measures provide further evidence of their adequacy for monitoring depression levels of patients in clinical settings. This double check of quality (within countries and populations) supports the ability of PROMIS measures for guaranteeing fair comparisons across languages and countries in specific clinical populations.",

abstract="To confirm associations with a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each with only a small effect size, as hypothesized in the polygenic theory for schizophrenia, the International Schizophrenia Consortium (2009, Nature 460:748-752) proposed a polygenic risk score (PRS) test and demonstrated its effectiveness when applied to psychiatric disorders. The basic idea of the PRS test is to use a half of the sample to select and up-weight those more likely to be associated SNPs, and then use the other half of the sample to test for aggregated effects of the selected SNPs. Intrigued by the novelty and increasing use of the PRS test, we aimed to evaluate and improve its performance for GWAS data. First, by an analysis of the PRS test, we point out its connection with the Sum test [Chapman and Whittaker, Genet Epidemiol 32:560-566; Pan, Genet Epidemiol 33:497-507]; given the known advantages and disadvantages of the Sum test, this connection motivated the development of several other polygenic tests, some of which may be more powerful than the PRS test under certain situations. Second, more importantly, to overcome the low statistical efficiency of the data-splitting strategy as adopted in the PRS test, we reformulate and thus modify the PRS test, obtaining several adaptive tests, which are closely related to the adaptive sum of powered score (SPU) test studied in the context of rare variant analysis [Pan et al., 2014, Genetics 197:1081-1095]. We use both simulated data and a real GWAS dataset of alcohol dependence to show dramatically improved power of the new tests over the PRS test; due to its superior performance and simplicity, we recommend the whole sample-based adaptive SPU test for polygenic testing. We hope to raise the awareness of the limitations of the PRS test and potential power gain of the adaptive SPU test.",

The weighted two-part test is a combination of two statistics, one on disease incidence and one on disease severity. More weight is given to the statistic with the larger a priori effect size, and the weights are determined to maximize testing power. The randomized test applies to the scenario where the total number of infections is relatively small. It uses information on disease severity to bolster power while preserving disease incidence as the primary interest. Properties of the proposed tests are explored asymptotically and by numerical studies. Although motivated by vaccine studies, the proposed tests apply to any trials that involve both binary and continuous outcomes for evaluating treatment effect.",

The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative developed a broad array of high-quality PRO measures. Towards reducing the number of items administered in measuring PROs, PROMIS employs Item Response Theory (IRT) and Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT). By only administering questions targeted to the subject's trait level, CAT has cut testing times in half(1). The IRT/CAT implementation in PROMIS is unidimensional in that there is a separate set of questions administered for each measured trait. However, there are often correlations among traits. Multidimensional IRT (MIRT) and multidimensional CAT (MCAT) provide items concerning several correlated traits, and should ameliorate patient burden. We developed an MIRT model using existing PROMIS item banks for depression and anxiety, developed MCAT software, and compared the efficiency of the MCAT approach to the unidimensional approach.

abstract="While estimation bias is a primary concern in psychological and educational measurement, the standard error is of equal importance in linking key aspects of the assessment structure, especially when the assessment goal concerns the classification of individuals into categories (e.g., master/non-mastery). In this paper, we show analytically how standard error of ability estimates affects expected classification accuracy and consistency when the decision is binary. When standard error decreases, the conditional classification accuracy and consistency increase. Given an examinee population and a cut score, smaller standard error over the entire latent trait continuum guarantees higher overall expected classification accuracy and consistency. We were also able to show the interrelationship between standard error, the expected classification consistency, and reliability. Utilizing the relationship between standard error and expected classification accuracy and consistency, we derive the upper bounds of the overall expected classification accuracy and consistency of a fixed-length computerized adaptive test. The lower bound of the expected classification accuracy and consistency is also derived given a number of stopping rules of variable-length computerized adaptive testing. Implications of these analytical results on operational tests are discussed.",

Thus, for evidence-based medicine, a precise, reliable, and valid (ie, ``objective'') assessment of the patient's reported ``subjective'' symptoms is warranted. There is a plethora of instruments available, which can provide psychometrically sound assessments of anxiety, but there are several limitations of current tools that need to be carefully considered for their successful use. Nevertheless, the empirical assessment of mental health status is not as accepted in medicine as is the assessment of biomarkers. One reason for this may be that different instruments assessing the same psychological construct use different scales. In this paper we present some new developments that promise to provide one common metric for the assessment of anxiety, to facilitate the general acceptance of mental health assessments in the future.",

abstract="The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap initiative devoted to developing better measurement tools for assessing constructs relevant to the clinical investigation and treatment of all diseases-constructs such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, sleep, physical functioning, and social participation. Following creation of item banks for these constructs, our priority has been to validate them, most often in short-term observational studies. We report here on a three-month prospective observational study with depressed outpatients in the early stages of a new treatment episode (with assessments at intake, one-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up). The protocol was designed to compare the psychometric properties of the PROMIS depression item bank (administered as a computerized adaptive test, CAT) with two legacy self-report instruments: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999). PROMIS depression demonstrated strong convergent validity with the CESD and the PHQ-9 (with correlations in a range from .72 to .84 across all time points), as well as responsiveness to change when characterizing symptom severity in a clinical outpatient sample. Identification of patients as ``recovered'' varied across the measures, with the PHQ-9 being the most conservative. The use of calibrations based on models from item response theory (IRT) provides advantages for PROMIS depression both psychometrically (creating the possibility of adaptive testing, providing a broader effective range of measurement, and generating greater precision) and practically (these psychometric advantages can be achieved with fewer items-a median of 4 items administered by CAT-resulting in less patient burden).",

The aim of this study was to culturally adapt the Items Banks of Anxiety and Depression of PROMIS to the Portuguese language. The process followed the recommendations of PROMIS through the advanced translation, reconciliation, back-translation, FACIT review, independent review, finalization, pre-test, and incorporation of the results from the pre-test. The translated version was pre-tested in ten patients, and items 3, 46, and 53 of the Bank of Anxiety and item 46 of the bank of Depression had to be changed. Changes affected equivalence of meaning, and the final version was consistent with the Brazilian population's linguistic and cultural skills. In conclusion, for the Brazilian population the translated version proved semantically and conceptually equivalent to the original.",

abstract="Existing sets of social and emotional stimuli suitable for social cognition research are limited in many ways, including size, unimodal stimulus delivery, and restriction to major universal emotions. Existing measures of social cognition could be improved by taking advantage of item response theory and adaptive testing technology to develop instruments that obtain more efficient measures of multimodal social cognition. However, for this to be possible, large pools of emotional stimuli must be obtained and validated. We present the development of a large, high-quality multimedia stimulus set produced by professional adult and child actors (ages 5 to 74) containing both visual and vocal emotional expressions. We obtained over 74,000 audiovisual recordings of a wide array of emotional and social behaviors, including the main universal emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise), as well as more complex social expressions (pride, affection, sarcasm, jealousy, and shame). The actors generated a high quantity of technically superior, ecologically valid stimuli that were digitized, archived, and rated for accuracy and intensity of expressions. A subset of these facial and vocal expressions of emotion and social behavior were submitted for quantitative ratings to generate parameters for validity and discriminability. These stimuli are suitable for affective neuroscience-based psychometric tests, functional neuroimaging, and social cognitive rehabilitation programs. The purposes of this report are to describe the method of obtaining and validating this database and to make it accessible to the scientific community. We invite all those interested in participating in the use and validation of these stimuli to access them at www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/actors/index.shtml .",

abstract="[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(3) of Psychological Assessment (see record 2014-16017-001). The mean, standard deviation and alpha coefficient originally reported in Table 1 should be 74.317, 10.214 and .802, respectively. The validity coefficients in the last column of Table 4 are affected as well. Correcting this error did not change the substantive interpretations of the results, but did increase the mean, standard deviation, alpha coefficient, and validity coefficients reported for the Honesty subscale in the text and in Tables 1 and 4. The corrected versions of Tables 1 and Table 4 are shown in the erratum.] Item response theory (IRT) models were applied to dichotomous and polytomous scoring of the Self-Deceptive Enhancement and Impression Management subscales of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (Paulhus, 1991, 1999). Two dichotomous scoring methods reflecting exaggerated endorsement and exaggerated denial of socially desirable behaviors were examined. The 1- and 2-parameter logistic models (1PLM, 2PLM, respectively) were applied to dichotomous responses, and the partial credit model (PCM) and graded response model (GRM) were applied to polytomous responses. For both subscales, the 2PLM fit dichotomous responses better than did the 1PLM, and the GRM fit polytomous responses better than did the PCM. Polytomous GRM and raw scores for both subscales yielded higher test-retest and convergent validity coefficients than did PCM, 1PLM, 2PLM, and dichotomous raw scores. Information plots showed that the GRM provided consistently high measurement precision that was superior to that of all other IRT models over the full range of both construct continuums. Dichotomous scores reflecting exaggerated endorsement of socially desirable behaviors provided noticeably weak precision at low levels of the construct continuums, calling into question the use of such scores for detecting instances of ``faking bad.'' Dichotomous models reflecting exaggerated denial of the same behaviors yielded much better precision at low levels of the constructs, but it was still less precision than that of the GRM. These results support polytomous over dichotomous scoring in general, alternative dichotomous scoring for detecting faking bad, and extension of GRM scoring to situations in which IRT offers additional practical advantages over classical test theory (adaptive testing, equating, linking, scaling, detecting differential item functioning, and so forth).",

abstract="The American College of Surgeons (ACoS) Commission on Cancer (CoC) has advanced a new patient-centered accreditation standard requiring programs to implement psychosocial distress screening and referral for psychosocial care. The field of psychosocial oncology has advocated for routine distress screening as an integral component of quality cancer care since the NCCN Distress Management Panel first recommended this practice in 1999. Accreditation standards have a significant impact on practice patterns and quality of care. The new ACoS CoC Psychosocial Distress Screening Standard provides a unique opportunity to integrate the science of psychosocial care into clinical practice. National organizations, including the American Psychosocial Oncology Society, the Association of Oncology Social Work, the Cancer Support Community, and LIVESTRONG, can offer valuable guidance and resources. This article reviews ACoS CoC requirements, highlighting key research findings and providing practical considerations to guide programs with implementation. Although screening for distress encompasses many domains, this article reviews the evidence linking depression-one aspect of distress-and cancer outcomes to highlight the profound influence psychosocial care delivery can have on promoting medical outcomes and quality cancer survivorship. The authors describe distress screening program accomplishments at Northwestern University, including the electronic administration of NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive testing item banks. Electronic medical record integration facilitates real-time scoring, interpretation, provider notification, and triage for psychosocial care. Roughly one-third of patients have requested assistance with psychosocial needs. As ACoS CoC programs implement psychosocial distress screening and management, the emerging field of implementation science can guide future clinical program developments and research priorities.",

The Toolbox is intended to serve as a ``core battery'' of assessment tools for cognition, sensation, motor function, and emotional health that will help to overcome the lack of consistency in measures used across epidemiological, observational, and intervention studies. A secondary goal of the NIH Toolbox is the identification of measures that are flexible, efficient, and precise, an agenda best fulfilled by the use of item banks calibrated with models from item response theory (IRT) and suitable for adaptive testing. Results from a sample of 1763 respondents supported use of the adult and pediatric item banks for emotional distress from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(®)) as a starting point for capturing the full range of negative affect in healthy individuals. Content coverage for the adult Toolbox was also enhanced by the development of a scale for somatic arousal using items from the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) and scales for hostility and physical aggression using items from the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ).",

The feasibility of administering a modified DYNHA SF-36 to adults with HIV was evaluated with Johns Hopkins University Moore (HIV) Clinic patients (N=100) and Internet consumer health panel members (N=101). Participants completed the DYNHA SF-36, modified to capture seven health domains [(physical function (PF), role function (RF, without physical or emotional attribution), bodily pain (BP), general health, vitality (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)], and scored to produce two summary components [Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS)]. Item-response theory-based response consistency, precision, mean scores, and discriminant validity were examined. A higher percentage of Internet participants responded consistently to the DYNHA SF-36. For each domain, three standard deviations were covered with five items (90{\%} reliability); however, RF and SF scores were less precise at the upper end of measurement (better functioning). Mean scores were slightly higher for the Internet sample, with the exception of VT and MCS. Clinic and Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis had significantly lower mean PCS and PF scores than those without a diagnosis. Additionally, significantly lower RF and BP scores were found for Internet participants reporting an AIDS diagnosis. The measure was well accepted by the majority of participants, although Internet respondents provided lower ratings for the tool's usefulness. The DYNHA SF-36 has promise for measuring the impact of HIV and its treatment in both the clinic setting and through telemonitoring.",

abstract="In 1997, we published a review in PharmacoEconomics about quality of life (QOL) measurement in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this article is to provide an update, as well as to revisit the development of the construct of QOL and its measurement as applied to schizophrenia. Since our previous article, there has been significant growth in the number of publications about QOL in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, alongside this significant increase in research interest, a number of concerns have also risen about the limitations and lack of impact the concept of QOL has on clinical care and health-policy decision making. A number of concerns previously outlined (such as lack of consensus on a uniform definition of QOL) continue to be an issue. However, we believe that a uniform definition may not be possible, and instead, it may be preferable to have several definitions, which may enrich the concept and broaden its usefulness. Some of the scales we reviewed in 1997 continue to be in use, while others are now rarely or never used. New scales with better psychometrics have been introduced, but most are without theoretical or conceptual foundation. On the other hand, the field of scaling in general has been changing over the past few years and is moving towards a new approach for scale development, based on item response theory, item banks and computer adaptive testing. Unfortunately, this has not extended to QOL in schizophrenia. There continues to be a dearth of theoretical and conceptual models for QOL in schizophrenia, which seems to create the perception that the construct lacks a good theoretical and scientific foundation. One of the major gaps identified in this review is the recognized lack of impact of QOL measurements on clinical management or policy decision making. The majority of publications continue to focus on measurement rather than what to do with the data. The lack of strategies to integrate QOL data in clinical care, as well as the failure to contribute to policy decisions, particularly in cost analysis or resource allocations, has created the perception that the construct of QOL in schizophrenia is not that useful. It is evident that, for QOL in schizophrenia to regain its promise, researchers must take the ultimate next step beyond measurement: to develop credible strategies for integrating QOL data in clinical practice. Additionally, more focused research is needed to demonstrate the role of QOL, not only as an outcome in itself but also as a contributor to other outcomes, such as adherence to medications, more satisfaction, less resource utilization and so on. Since self-appraisal of QOL does not happen in a vacuum but relates to the total human experience in all its biological, psychosocial and environmental aspects, particular attention must also be focused on important neurobiological dimensions such as affect and cognition. Both are significantly affected by the illness itself and its treatment.",

There is a need for alternative measures that more efficiently assess adaptive behavior in children and youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) is a computer-based assessment of a child's ability to perform activities required for personal self-sufficiency and engagement in the community. This study evaluated the applicability, representativeness, and comprehensiveness of the Daily Activity, Social/Cognitive, and Responsibility domains for children and youth with an ASD. Twenty professionals and 18 parents provided feedback via in-person or virtual focus groups and cognitive interviews. Items were perceived to represent relevant functional activities within each domain. Child factors and assessment characteristics influenced parents' ratings. In response to feedback, 15 items and additional directions were added to ensure the PEDI-CAT is a meaningful measure when used with this population.",

abstract="People with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy are likely to experience enhanced social and emotional strain. Critically, those with both vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and psychosocial problems may have significantly reduced levels of functioning compared with psychologically healthy counterparts. This can cause inadequate compliance, increased strain on family functioning, worse diabetes control, increased progression of diabetic retinopathy and, consequently, further psychosocial stress resulting in a number of concerning implications for disease management, clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. However, the emotional and social health consequences of diabetic retinopathy have not yet been systematically explored. This information is crucial as it allows for a targeted approach to treatment and prevention and avoidance of the potentially detrimental implications described above. Therefore, this paper reviews the current qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and identifies directions for future research. Key search terms were applied to the electronic databases Pubmed, ISI Web of Science and Embase and the bibliographies of relevant papers were systematically reviewed for additional references. Overall, the evidence suggests that diabetic retinopathy and associated vision loss have several debilitating effects, including disruption of family functioning, relationships and roles; increased social isolation and dependence; and deterioration of work prospects resulting in increased financial strain. Adverse emotional responses include fear, anxiety, vulnerability, guilt, loss of confidence, anger, stress and self-perception issues. However, the research to date is largely qualitative in nature, with most quantitative studies being small, cross-sectional and somewhat outdated. Similarly, the outcome measures used in many studies to date are suboptimal in terms of content and validity. Therefore, this review identifies the need for improved outcome measures to provide valid, meaningful measurement of the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and discusses potential directions for future research such as item banking and computer adaptive testing.",

Although IRT has become prevalent in the measurement of ability and achievement, its contributions to clinical domains have been less extensive. Applications of IRT to clinical assessment are reviewed to appraise its current and potential value. Benefits of IRT include comprehensive analyses and reduction of measurement error, creation of computer adaptive tests, meaningful scaling of latent variables, objective calibration and equating, evaluation of test and item bias, greater accuracy in the assessment of change due to therapeutic intervention, and evaluation of model and person fit. The theory may soon reinvent the manner in which tests are selected, developed, and scored. Although challenges remain to the widespread implementation of IRT, its application to clinical assessment holds great promise. Recommendations for research, test development, and clinical practice are provided.",

abstract="In the past, a German Computerized Adaptive Test, based on Item Response Theory (IRT), was developed for purposes of assessing the construct depression [Computer-adaptive test for depression (D-CAT)]. This study aims at testing the feasibility and validity of the real computer-adaptive application.The D-CAT, supplied by a bank of 64 items, was administered on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a predetermined reliability (r > or = 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)].The D-CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds), well accepted by the patients and reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95{\%} of the cases, 10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between the D-CAT and the HADS, CES-D, and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The D-CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established questionnaires do.The D-CAT proved an efficient, well accepted and reliable tool. Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures, whereby the CAT is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item selection for content in the future.",

abstract="Within the framework of item response theory (IRT), we developed a German version of an item bank, as well as a software application that can be employed to measure anxiety by means of a computer adaptive test (CAT). A sample of n = 2348 psychiatric and psychosomatic patients answered a set of up to 13 standardized questionnaires. 81 items drawn from these questionnaires were considered pertinent to the anxiety construct. Various tests were conducted to ensure the suitability of these items for an IRT-based assessment. After these tests, 50 items remained in the item bank and were calibrated using the Generalized Partial Credit Model. Simulation studies conducted on an independent sample of n = 1528 respondents indicate that 6-8 items suffice to measure the latent trait with high precision (standard error <or= 0.32). CAT scores correlated highly with scores estimated from all available items (r = .97) and scale scores of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, state scale, r = .93). Within a routine clinical setting, 102 in-patients answered the Anxiety-CAT along with a number of established anxiety questionnaires. The correlation between the Anxiety-CAT and the STAI state scale was still high (r = .60), but lower than the correlations found in the simulation studies. The Anxiety-CAT was able to differentiate between mental health disorders in a similar manner as established questionnaires. These results suggest that the Anxiety-CAT does indeed exhibit the advantages expected from theory, but the results of further studies are needed in order to judge its full potential for research and clinical practice.",

The aim of this study was to develop a computer adaptive testing (CAT) system for directing subjects into generating greater forces than they intended. The system was tested on eleven cooperative female subjects who volunteered to take part in this study. The CAT consisted of interactive testing cycles, each containing a series of isometric tasks of differing intensities. While fulfilling these tasks, the tested subjects were asked to take care not to exceed a self-selected upper force limit (F(ssl)) that they were previously trained to memorize (order of 40{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction). Visual feedback, displaying the applied force exertions, was provided to the tested subjects but was modified by re-scaling the display in an un-anticipated manner. To confirm the subject's ability to remember her F(ssl), repeatability of joint memory was tested one week after the CAT. The CAT results were successful in causing ten out of the eleven tested participants to exert a higher force than they intended to. Additionally, the CAT algorithm caused a statistically significant higher force than the repeatability test. These results demonstrate the potential of CAT methods in improving the clinical evaluation of muscle strength, particularly in those cases where the subject's cooperation is not sufficient.",

Insufficiency in sample size as a result of overestimating the effect size can be destructive to the success of the clinical trial. Sample size re-estimation may need to be properly considered as a part of clinical trial planning. This paper is intended to give the motivations for the sample size re-estimation based partly on the effect size observed at an interim analysis and for a resulting simple adaptive test strategy. The performance of this adaptive design strategy is assessed by comparing it with a fixed maximum sample size design that is properly adjusted in anticipation of the possible sample size adjustment.",

abstract="Physical, psychosocial, and lifestyle disturbances, along with physical and emotional symptoms, have been shown to impact the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of those dependent on renal replacement therapy. The value of HRQOL measurement as a tool to improve clinical care has been recognized by patients, clinical investigators, and health care providers. The potential importance of HRQOL assessment lies in the additional information it provides and the impact it has on the clinical decision-making process between a patient and a physician. There remain a multitude of challenges facing renal providers who wish to incorporate HRQOL measurement to improve patient care. These challenges include the clinician's understanding of the conceptual model of HRQOL, the quality of the scientific process that contributed to the current literature on HRQOL, a willingness of the clinician to incorporate HRQOL information into clinical practice, and the logistic difficulties of collecting and applying HRQOL data in a busy practice setting. Arguably, optimizing HRQOL may be the most substantial impact the health care team will have on the person with kidney failure. In order to implement HRQOL assessment at the point of care, providers may consider using computer adaptive testing and scoring algorithms using item response theory, which will allow adequate reliability for interpretation of change among individuals. Moreover, the effective assessment and interpretation of HRQOL will be aided by continued publication of norms, outcomes of randomized controlled trials, and continued experience of investigators and clinicians.",

abstract="A multistage testing strategy to detect QTL for resistance to infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon is proposed. First, genotyping of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) were carried out using dead offspring from a disease resistance challenge test. Second, AFLP genotyping among survivors followed by a Mendelian segregation test was performed. Third, within-family survival analyses using all offspring were developed and applied to significant TDT markers with Mendelian inheritance. Maximum-likelihood methodology was developed for TDT with dominant markers to exploit linkage disequilibrium within families. The strategy was tested with two full-sib families of Atlantic salmon sired by the same male and consisting of 79 offspring in total. All dead offspring from the two families were typed for 64 primer combinations, resulting in 340 scored markers. There were 26 significant results out of 401 TDTs using dead offspring. In the second stage, only 17 marker families showed Mendelian segregation and were tested in survival analysis. A permutation test was performed for all survival analyses to compute experimentwise P-values. Two markers, aaccac356 and agccta150, were significant at P < 0.05 when accounting for multiple testing in the survival analyses. The proposed strategy might be more powerful than current mapping strategies because it reduces the number of tests to be performed in the last testing stage.",

abstract="The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System is a collection of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness. The measurement system, under development since 1987, began with the creation of a generic CORE questionnaire called the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). The FACT-G (now in Version 4) is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into four primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. It is appropriate for use with patients with any form of cancer, and extensions of it have been used and validated in other chronic illness condition (e.g., HIV/AIDS; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's disease; rheumatoid arthritis), and in the general population. The FACIT Measurement System now includes over 400 questions, some of which have been translated into more than 45 languages. Assessment of any one patient is tailored so that the most-relevant questions are asked and administration time for any one assessment is usually less than 15 minutes. This is accomplished both by the use of specific subscales for relevant domains of HRQOL, or computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of selected symptoms and functional areas. FACIT questionnaires can be administered by self-report (paper or computer) or interview (face-to-face or telephone). Available scoring, normative data and information on meaningful change now allow one to interpret results in the context of a growing literature base.",

abstract="A number of issues critical to the development of computer-based neuropsychological testing systems that remain continuing challenges to their widespread use in occupational and environmental health are reviewed. Several computer-based neuropsychological testing systems have been developed over the last 20 years, and they have contributed substantially to the study of neurologic effects of a number of environmental exposures. However, many are no longer supported and do not run on contemporary personal computer operating systems. Issues that are continuing challenges for development of computer-based neuropsychological tests in environmental and occupational health are discussed: (1) some current technological trends that generally make test development more difficult; (2) lack of availability of usable speech recognition of the type required for computer-based testing systems; (3) implementing computer-based procedures and tasks that are improvements over, not just adaptations of, their manually-administered predecessors; (4) implementing tests of a wider range of memory functions than the limited range now available; (5) paying more attention to motivational influences that affect the reliability and validity of computer-based measurements; and (6) increasing the usability of and audience for computer-based systems. Partial solutions to some of these challenges are offered. The challenges posed by current technological trends are substantial and generally beyond the control of testing system developers. Widespread acceptance of the ``tablet PC'' and implementation of accurate small vocabulary, discrete, speaker-independent speech recognition would enable revolutionary improvements to computer-based testing systems, particularly for testing memory functions not covered in existing systems. Dynamic, adaptive procedures, particularly ones based on item-response theory (IRT) and computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) methods, will be implemented in new tests that will be more efficient, reliable, and valid than existing test procedures. These additional developments, along with implementation of innovative reporting formats, are necessary for more widespread acceptance of the testing systems.",

abstract="Virtual environments (VEs), offering a new human-computer interaction paradigm, have attracted much attention, in clinical psychology, especially in the treatment of phobias. However, a possible new application of VR in psychology is as assessment tool: VEs can be considered as an highly sophisticated form of adaptive testing. This chapter describes the context of current psychological assessment and underlines possible advantages of a VR based assessment tool. The chapter also details the characteristics of BIVRS, Body Image Virtual Reality Scale, an assessment tool designed to assess cognitive and affective components of body image. It consists of a non-immersive 3D graphical interface through which the patient is able to choose between 9 figures of different size which vary in size from underweight to overweight. The software was developed in two architectures, the first (A) running on a single user desktop computer equipped with a standard virtual reality development software and the second (B) splitted into a server (B1) accessible via Internet and actually running the same virtual ambient as in (A) and a VRML client (B2) so that anyone can access the application.",

Correlations between MMPI-2 scales and other psychometric measures (Beck Depression Inventory; Symptom Checklist-Revised; State-Trait Anxiety and Anger Scales; and the Anger Expression Scale) support the validity of the CA MMPI-2. Substantial item savings may be realized with the implementation of the countdown procedure.",
